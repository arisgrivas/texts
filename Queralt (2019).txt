Abstract
This manuscript revisits the relationship between war and state making in modern times by focusing on two prominent types of war finance: taxes and external finance. Financing war with tax money enhances the capacity to assess wealth and monitor compliance, namely fiscal capacity. Tax-financed war facilitates the adoption of powersharing institutions, which transform taxation into a nonzero-sum game, carrying on the effect of war in the long-run. Financing war with external debt does not contribute to long-term fiscal capacity in the presence of debt relief or when old war bonds are exchanged for nontax revenue as part of the default settlement. The empirical evidence draws from war around the world as early as 1816. Results suggest that the advent of a genuinely global capital market in the early nineteenth century undermined the association between war, state making, and political reform.

1 Introduction
War, although devastating, offers a matchless opportunity to transform the state. The
magnitude of resources a country must amass to finance the means of war offers rulers the
incentives to invest in state making while reducing domestic resistance to taxation. War clears
the path to fiscal centralization,1 the professionalization of the tax administration,2 and the
adoption of new taxes—from excises3 to progressive income taxes.4 Fiscal innovations are
often accompanied by complementary organizations, including treasuries and central banks,5
and improved budgeting technologies.6 Far from disappearing, the financial innovations that
make war possible are expected to exert lasting effects on the extractive capacity of the
state;7 that is, states make war as much as war makes states.8
The argument above, known as the bellicist theory of state formation, draws heavily from
the history of state building in Europe, from the fifteenth to the eighteenth century.9 But
the evidence is mixed outside the European continent. Why did war make states in Europe
but did not in the so-called periphery (i.e., Asia, Africa, and Latin America)? Modern states
outside Europe were created only in the nineteenth century, coinciding with or following
the first globalization of international finance.10 Readily available external finance, this
manuscript shows, weakened the incentives to expand taxation and develop domestic credit
institutions, breaking the connection between war- and state-making.
Others have revisited the bellicist hypothesis by focusing on initial conditions: urban
ization and regime type11 and initial state capacity and social composition.12 Insightful as

they are, these studies omit the fundamental change that increased liquidity in international
credit markets in the nineteenth century represented for state formation. That is the focus
of this study. Centeno and Thies, the two closest contributions, rightfully argue that inter
national loans limited state capacity in Latin America;13 however, the theoretical mechanism
by which rulers preferred external finance over taxation is left unspecified. If taxation is as
beneficial in the long run as previous works suggest, why would rulers not prefer to finance
war with tax money? Second, the mechanism of transmission that connects warfare (or
lack thereof) in the nineteenth century to the present day is absent. Third, the Ricardian
equivalence states that loans act as deferred taxes. The implication for state building is that
financing war one way or another should not make a difference in the long run; however, the
empirical evidence in Centeno and Thies suggests that loan-financed war in Latin American
did not build capacity (i.e., did not “make states”). An explanation for the reason that the
Ricardian equivalence does not always hold is missing. Fourth, the empirics suffer from the
limitations of purely observational work.
I fill these vacuums, first, by advancing a political economy of war finance: Exerting
a fiscal effort to finance war with tax revenue expands the future share of private income
that the ruler can tax. However, taxation requires political concessions in order to overcome
taxpayers’ resistance to higher rates, which explains the ruler’s reservations to finance war
with taxes, let alone if alternative sources of funding like external loans are available. A
simple decision-theoretic model suggests that the ruler’s preference for foreign loans relative
to taxes depends on a combination of domestic and international conditions: First, shorter
time horizons strengthen the ruler’s preference for external finance because gains in fiscal
capacity are realized only in the long run. Shorter time horizons are consistent with political
instability and scenarios in which political survival depends on winning war, hence the ability
to mobilize resources in a timely manner. Second, low levels of initial state capacity make
external finance more appealing because the latter secures funds that exceed the short-run
13Centeno 2002; Thies 2005.

possibilities of taxation. Third, low levels of initial power-sharing institutions strengthen
preference for external finance because the alternative—taxation—involves higher political
concessions. Fourth, cycles of high liquidity in the international credit market favor external
finance. High liquidity implies more favorable loan terms even for countries with dubious
fundamentals, thus increasing the present value of external finance. Fifth, an extended
practice of external debt relief and the exchange of old bonds for nontax revenue and state
monopolies limit the future cost of default, strengthening the preference for external loans
over taxes. This battery of domestic and international conditions suggest that the scope
conditions to finance war with taxation, even if only partially, are rather narrow, hence the
opportunities to build long-run fiscal capacity.
I address the other three gaps in the literature as follows: First, I advance (and show
empirically) a mechanism of transmission of the effect of war finance that builds on its
political economy. Financing war with taxes facilitates political compromise between the
ruler and taxpayers. In turn, these power-sharing institutions transform taxation into a
nonzero-sum game, carrying on the effect of warfare into long-term fiscal capacity. Second, I
show that the Ricardian equivalence does not necessarily hold in the presence of external debt
relief or if defaulters can exchange war debt for nontax revenue and state monopolies. When
that is the case, war does not necessarily make states. Third, I address threats to inference in
previous work by exploiting unannounced systemic shocks in international capital markets
known as sudden stops of credit. These global crises created time windows in which, for
exogenous reasons, warring states could not rely on external loans to finance the means of
war. To cope with endogeneity in war participation, I concentrate on a subsample of wars
that were initiated while credit still flowed but suddenly dried up, thus disconnecting the
decision to go to war or the type of war to fight from availability of external finance.
The empirical analysis draws on a sample of 100+ countries as early as 1816. Holding
a host of initial economic and political characteristics constant, results show that war is
conducive to stronger states in the short and long run if it is waged in the absence of
3


external finance, that is, when incentives to tax were strong. On the contrary, making
war while having access to international capital markets tends to be inconsequential—even
detrimental—for state building. Consistent with the original work of Charles Tilly—often
oversimplified—results confirm that state building is not merely a function of war making
but also access to domestic capital, namely taxes or domestic loans.14
The last section of the empirical analysis offers evidence of the transmission mechanism:
Tax-financed war in the long ninteenth century strengthened executive constraints in the
short and long run, facilitating transmission of the fiscal effort of war into future tax capacity.
The conclusion section compares state building in the periphery with that of European
countries in early modern times.
2 A Political Economy of War Finance
Modern warfare is funded by a combination of loans and taxes.15 Resorting to one or
the other is as much a matter of possibility (has the state enough capacity to tax and
access to credit markets?) as of political opportunity (who benefits from borrowing and
taxing?). In this section I present a decision-theoretic model that incorporates both types
of considerations. I model an incumbent’s decision to finance the cost of war, W , with taxes
T or loans L, which, for the sake of exposition, are assumed mutually exclusive.16 I also
assume that war, which begins and ends in Period 1, is exogenous and that the incumbent
seeks to maximize war funds and minimize political concessions. This stylized set up seeks
to identify how the incumbent’s incentives to resort to external finance vary as a function
of domestic political calculus and the liquidity of international credit markets. The result of
this exercise informs the empirical design. Other forms of war finance are discussed at the
14Tilly 1990. 15Poast 2015; Sprague 1917. 16War may be funded by additional means, including expropriation, money printing, and forced labor. The more alternatives to taxation are available to the ruler to assume the costs of war, the more uncertain it is that war activates political and institutional mechanisms that are conducive to long-term state capacity. Refer to the final paragraph of this Section and the Mechanism section for further details.

end of this section.
Taxation is politically delicate because it involves some form of extraction from elites,
the masses, or both. Rulers can rarely impose new taxes on elites without their consent,
consultation, and negotiation.17 In return for newer taxes, elites may demand veto powers
over spending decisions. Consistently, tax increases to finance the means of war yielded major
advances in parliamentary representation in early modern Europe.18 Taxing the masses may
not be easier, especially when the tax increase is accompanied by a military draft. In such
circumstances political concessions may be required to prevent tax revolts from below.19 One
way or another, power-sharing institutions “were the price and outcome of bargaining with
different members of the subject population for the wherewithal of state activity, especially
the means of war.”20 Throughout, ct denotes the ruler’s political concessions from financing
war with taxes.
Financing war with taxes requires some capacity to assess wealth and monitor compliance,
namely fiscal capacity. Tax revenue is bounded above by the present stock of fiscal capacity
κ ∈ [0, 1]. Tax capacity can be expanded via institutional investment at the cost of forgone
public consumption.21 Here I take a different route, one in which tax collection improves over
time as a result of know-how accumulation by the tax administration: e.g., tax collectors
learn over time common avoidance schemes.22 Know-how expands future fiscal capacity by
η < 1 units, which captures the ratchet effect of taxation in a reduced form. Future payoffs
are discounted at a rate δ ≤ 1. Together, the present discounted value of financing war with
taxes is
κT − W − ct + δ[(κ + η)T − ct
] (1)

Investment-based models of capacity building like these emphasize types of inter-temporal dilemmas that deviate attention from the key political trade-off at stake: Assuming political costs today vs. A lottery of debt service and default tomorrow. A know-how accumulation model is sufficient to articulate this dilemma. 22Brewer 1988.

Expression 1 captures in a stylized fashion the intrinsic dilemma of fiscal capacity building.
It expands permanently the volume of resources that can be mobilized for national defense,
κ + η, but it does so by increasing executive constraints, ct. It is not obvious that the ruler
will always prefer to finance war with taxation particularly if other options are available.23
The political consequences associated with taxation—power-sharing institutions—are
crucial to understanding persistence of fiscal effects of war mobilization, κ + η. Limited
government is conducive to “quasi-voluntary compliance” by taxpayers because political
accountability grants credibility to the promised returns for taxes.24 Besley and Persson
formalize the opportunities of sustained cooperation in tax policy created by power-sharing
institutions.25 In “common-interest states”—where government revenue is used in the com
mon interest (e.g., national defense)—taxation becomes a positive-sum self-sustaining game:
The ruler secures a constant stream of funds to produce the public good while taxpayers are
protected from arbitrary expropriation.26 Power-sharing institutions, in sum, carry on the
fiscal effect of warfare in the long run.
Financing war with domestic loans is expected to carry political concessions similar than
taxation;27 however, domestic borrowing requires levels of capital accumulation that cannot
be taken for granted, especially not in the developing world.28 When domestic credit is tight,
states finance externally.
Compared to taxation and domestic finance, external finance carries lower political costs,
cl < ct. First, rulers do not need to concede political rights or representation to international
lenders—a good margin suffices. Second, loans have low public visibility, which preempts
23Expression 1 resonates with the leader’s dilemma of investing in “good institutions” that Acemoglu 2003 and Besley and Persson 2011 have formally addressed. Although high fiscal capacity might be a better societal outcome (better national defense together with executive constraints), political incentives to prevent future extraction via taxation by the opposition might work against it. 24Levi 1988. 25Besley and Persson 2011. 26Fujihira 2000 points out the role of two power-sharing institutions—parliaments and political parties—in facilitating sustained levels of taxation. These institutions aggregate competing tax preferences of capital and labor facilitating compromise and sustained cooperation after war. Consistently, Lee and Paine 2018 show that, in the presence of executive constraints, a history of warfare translates into long-run fiscal capacity. 27North and Weingast 1989. 28della Paolera and Taylor 2013.

social contestation during wartime.29 Third, external finance decreases domestic account
ability: Not having to depend on their citizens for tax revenue, rulers have a freer hand in
enacting war policy.30
Loans operate as deferred taxes—the Ricardian equivalence states.31 Debt is repaid in
Period 2 out of tax revenue, which carries political concessions ct. Repayment, however, is
often uncertain; default happens with probability d, and carries a sanction, β ≥ 0. This
parameter reflects the stringency of a future default settlement. Together, the ruler’s present
discounted value of financing war externally is
L − W − cl + δ[(1 − d)(κT − (1 + i)L − ct
) − dβ] (2)
where (1 + i)L denotes repayment of the standing principal plus interest. The latter is set in
the international capital market, where loans are floated. Countries with a history of default
are expected to pay a premium p for their lack of reputation.32 Let i = r + p, where r is the
interest rate of a risk-free sovereign bond (e.g., the British Consol) and p = (1 + r)d/(1 − d),
which is strictly increasing in the probability of default.33
When does the ruler prefer to finance war with external loans? When tax revenue is lower
than the cost of war, κT < W ; or when κT ≥ W provided that
L ≥ κT − ∆c + δ[ηT + d(κT − ct + β)]
1 − δ(1 + r∗) (3)
29Flores-Macı ́as and Kreps 2017; Fujihira 2000. 30?. Given the time period under consideration, we can conceive a fourth advantage: External funds minimize the political cost of rearmament for conservative governments—the vast majority in the longnineteenth century. Facing an external threat, conservative governments can levy higher tax rates on their core supporters—the economic elite—to expand military capacity at the risk of causing revolt within their own coalition; alternatively, they can seek international allies or concede to demands of the adversary as a substitute for internal strengthening (Narizny, 2003). External loans allow conservative governments to finance rearmament while saving political costs derived from raising taxes on their core constituency. 31Barro 1979. 32Tomz 2007. 33The premium is derived by setting the international investors’ profit when lending is risk free, W (1 + r) − W , equal to the international investors’ profit when the probability of default is nonzero, d ∗ 0 + (1 − d) ∗ (1 + r + p)W − W , and solving for p.

where ∆c = (ct − cl). We can draw several lessons from Expression 3. First, the preference
for external finance strengthens as the costs of political concessions ∆c grow relative to the
discounted value of fiscal capacity expansion, κ + δη. This result illuminates why common
interest states characterized by sustained taxation and political accountability are harder
to reach when initial fiscal capacity κ is low.34 Interestingly, the preference for loans over
taxes decreases as cl approaches ct, that is, as ∆c shrinks. This gap narrows when some
form of power-sharing institutions are already in place in Period 1. Empirically, these results
recommend controlling for initial fiscal capacity and political conditions whenever possible.
Second, Expression 3 suggests that the preference for external finance depends on the
cycle of the international capital market. To see this point, let’s assume that r is set in
equilibrium in the international market in which capital supply is defined by the inverse
linear function rs = αs + φsqs, where qs denotes the global supply of capital, and φs > 0.
Without loss of generality, global loan demand is given by the inverse function rd = 1 − φdqd,
φd > 0. The international market clears at r∗ = 1 − φd(1 − αs)/(φd + φs), the price of
the risk-free asset (e.g., British Consols). When international capital markets experience a
positive shock—for instance, following a capital surplus in a major economy—the interna
tional credit supply shifts to rs = α′
s + φsq, α′
s < αs, hence (r′)∗ < r∗, p((r′)∗) < p(r∗),
and i((r′)∗, p((r′)∗)) < i(r∗, p(r∗)). That is, in expansive cycles, more and cheaper credit is
available even for countries with a history of default.35 And viceversa, international capital
market contractions—for instance, following a global financial crisis—make credit tighter
and more expensive across the board, weakening preference for external finance. For a large
enough negative shock, α′
s > 1, international lending ceases, strengthening incentives to fi
nance war with taxes. The empirical design builds from this result to identify periods in
which incentives to tax are strongest.
Third, preference for external finance is stronger in the presence of short time horizons,
34Besley and Persson 2011. 35Ballard-Rosa, Mosley, and Wellhausen 2019 show that even today borrowers with weak and undemocratic institutions access international finance in favorable terms when the global financial cycle is good. In other words, in good credit cycles, investors are risk-tolerant and less sensitive to political risk.

or low δ. These may reflect individual time preferences, general political instability, or the
importance of winning war for political survival. Either way
[b]orrowing provides the current leader with resources today, while repayment typically has to be made by a future government. From the national perspective, loans are not free resources, but unless the leader is fortunate enough to have a long tenure, they are from the leader’s perspective. (?, p.527)
Fourth, the effect of the probability of default d depends on magnitude of the default
sanction: For β > ct − κT , preference for external finance weakens with the probability of
default.36 This is driven by aversion to sanction β associated with default. When β < ct−κT ,
the disutility of defaulting is smaller than the disutility of taxing; hence, external finance
will be preferred the most by those with a high probability of default, potentially creating a
lending-and-default cycle. To prevent this scenario, international investors can increase the
severity of default sanctions β. However, the opposite often happened in the first globalization
of credit: Despite recurrent default,37 haircuts were frequent and substantial, reaching 40 and
50% of war debt.38 When debt was unforgiven, default settlements included reductions in
interest rates and extensions of maturities, which weakened further the incentives to enhance
fiscal capacity after default. Importantly, some default settlements did not even involve a
transfer of tax money for war debt. Instead, defaulters would exchange old bonds for nontax
revenue (e.g. land) and state monopolies;39 The exchange of these assets for old bonds, first,
explains why lending to serial defaulters took place in the first globalization of finance (more
in Section 3.3); second, and specific to state building, it allowed defaulters to regain access
to international credit markets without enhancing tax capacity, precluding the Ricardian
equivalence.40
36This inequality follows from the FOC of d for the right-hand side of (3). 37Reinhart and Rogoff 2009. 38Lindert and Morton 1989; Jorgensen and Sachs 1988. 39For instance, as part of the 1890 default settlement of Peru’s standing war debt, state railroads, land, and mining were placed in the hands of British bondholders (Vizcarra, 2009). International investors could also take control over customs or other forms of revenue collection (e.g. tobacco monopoly) and redirect resources towards debt service. This practice, however, did not necessarily enhance the capacity to tax of the borrower. See Gardner 2017, Maurer and Arroyo Abad 2017, and Reinhart and Trebesch 2015 for the effects of foreign financial administration in Liberia, Greece and eight Latin American economies, respectively. 40Appendix A models the use of equity to finance warfare as well as collateral. This extension shows
9


Empirical Implications
The previous discussion suggests that having access to external credit is consequential to
understanding the conditions under which war makes states precisely because taxes and loans
may not exert the same transformative effects on fiscal capacity. The bellicist hypothesis
assumes the Ricardian equivalence, namely, that loans operate as deferred taxes. Accordingly,
rulers assume responsibility for war debt, (1 − d) = 1, and enhance taxation to service debt
after military conflict, thus contributing to state making. However, generalized debt relief
and the exchange of war debt for equity may unravel that causal chain, thus the equivalence
of taxes and loans for the purpose of state building.41 Based on the uncertain effects of
loan-financed war on fiscal capacity and the positive impact of financing war with taxes, I
expect that the more war is financed with taxes relative to loans, the stronger fiscal capacity
should be after military conflict, holding everything else constant.
Finally, war may be (partially) financed with tools other than taxes and loans: Rulers
might rely on nontax revenue (e.g., royalties from state monopolies),42 expand the money
supply,43 exert financial repression,44 expropriate, or sell offices.45 Choosing taxation rather
than any of these routes is, again, a matter of capacity and political calculus. Importantly, in
terms of state building, any alternative path to taxation is expected to exert effects similar to
external finance. That is, these revenue alternatives do not require building a tax apparatus
capable of assessing wealth and securing a stable stream of revenue—namely enhancing
fiscal capacity—nor activate a key mechanism of transmission of the ratchet effect of war:
namely strengthening power-sharing institutions. In sum, this discussion implies that the
that, in anticipation of debt-equity swaps, the cost of borrowing decreases and the incentives to float loans strengthen, thus expanding the states of the world in which war is financed externally. 41Probably no scholar would defend a strict version of the Ricardian equivalence, but there is a general understanding that loans and taxes operate in roughly similar ways. The argument made in this article is that the conditions under which the Ricardian equivalent hold may be narrower than previously thought, and this helps us to understand why externally-financed war may not translate into state-making. 42Refer to Appendix A. 43Sprague 1917; Fujihira 2000. 44Menaldo 2016. 45Hoffman 1994.
10


scope conditions of the bellicist hypothesis are somewhat narrow. Easier access to foreign
credit following the globalization of capital in the nineteenth century made those conditions
narrower.
3 Design
To investigate the lasting effect of war finance on fiscal capacity, one could rely on war
specific finance data. That is, what was the proportion of taxes relative to external loans
that country i mobilized to finance war j, and how did that shaped i’s long-term fiscal
capacity? This design is unfeasible and inadequate. First, cross-national conflict-specific
data regarding the manner in which war is financed are unavailable in any systematic way.
Second, even if such data existed, that design would raise concerns of endogeneity because
access to international capital markets is not randomly assigned.
Alternatively, I propose comparing the relative effect of war waged when countries have
and lack access to the international capital markets for exogenous reasons (more below). The
logic of this test is based on the political economy of war finance elaborated in the previous
section. Access to external finance structures incentives to tax. When rulers cannot borrow
externally, the incentives to raise taxes to finance the means of war should be strongest. By
contrast, having access to external loans should weaken the incentives to strengthen the tax
apparatus because loans allow the ruler to finance war while eluding the political costs of
taxation. Next I specify the time period, unit of analysis, and nature of credit shocks.
3.1 Time Period
To test for legacies, I estimate the effect of war taking place between 1816 and 1913 on
various proxies for fiscal capacity circa 2000. This strategy mimics Dincecco and Prado,
who find that countries that fought more wars and suffered the largest number of casualties
11


between 1816 and 1913 had higher ratios of direct taxes to GDP by 1995.46 The lower
cut-off, 1816, is deliberately chosen to maximize the number of cases in the sample. Most
countries in the periphery were created only in the nineteenth century. The upper cut-off,
1913, serves two purposes: First, it guarantees that fiscal efforts are driven by military need.
The boom in welfare spending following WWI makes it harder to isolate the effect of war on
fiscal capacity because the newly created social programs also pushed for higher taxation.
Second, the financial costs of WWI and WWII are unprecedented. Most participants were
countries with high fiscal capacity to begin with. Including total war in the analysis would
exacerbate problems of selection.
Importantly, whereas Dincecco and Prado emphasize the lasting effect of war making, I
focus on war finance. I use finer proxies of long-term fiscal capacity while showing evidence of
short-term effects of war finance, its transmission, and transmission mechanisms. In addition,
I address endogeneity in war participation as well as credit access.
3.2 Unit of Analysis
Most wars from 1816 to 1913 were interstate, involving European powers as well as inter
nationally unrecognized states. Wars were fought against colonial powers and also between
neighboring countries, also in Africa, Latin America, and Southeast Asia.47 In an effort to
move beyond the experience of war making in the developed world, I work with Wimmer and
Min war data, which includes all military disputes exceeding 1,000 casualties and involving
internationally recognized and unrecognized states around the world since 1800.48
With the use of internationally unrecognized states in the analysis, I assume that these
political entities exerted a fiscal effort in financing war comparable to recognized states. This
is the case in, for instance, the wars of independence in Latin America,49 the African wars
46Dincecco and Prado 2012. 47Butcher and Griffiths 2015. 48Wimmer and Min 2009. 49Centeno 2002.
12


before and after the arrival of the Europeans50 or interstate wars over succession disputes
in Southeast Asia.51 One caveat is the extent to which internationally unrecognized state
could issue loans in the international markets. Plenty of evidence exists for Latin American
countries, but less so for African and Asian countries. Suppose these units were fully excluded
from international markets. Then, this would make war even more consequential. That is,
excluded from international markets, unrecognized polities would have strong incentives to
finance war with taxes. Econometrically, this would work against the research hypothesis,
by which we should not observe state building when international markets are operative.
Importantly, results do not hinge on the inclusion on internationally unrecognized units.
Table 5, in which only states recognized by the international system by the time they go to
war are considered, and Table 7, in which Wimmer and Min data are replaced by Correlates
of War (COW) data, which includes only internationally recognized states, yield the same
results.
Wimmer and Min data stand out in three additional ways: First, wars are mapped onto
current state boundaries, making possible tracking which state should inherit the legacy of
war making, as well as investigating the effect of fighting war within national territories or
elsewhere.52 Second, Wimmer and Min distinguish civil from secessionist war. As part of the
robustness tests, the latter type (defined as fights against the political center with the aim of
establishing an independent state) is considered. After all, secessionist war may contribute
to revenue maximization in a fashion similar to interstate war.53 Third, in Wimmer and
Min nonproxy wars waged by colonial subjects against third territories are attributed to the
colonial subject and not to the metropolis, thus maximizing the match between war makers
and fiscal outcomes.
Altogether, I consider 147 armed conflicts between 1816 and 1913, of which 114 are inter
50Reid 2012 and Gardner 2012, respectively. 51Butcher and Griffiths 2015. 52Refer to Appendix B for country splits and merges. 53Non-secessionist civil wars are used as a control only because their contribution to state building has yet to be established.
13


state wars and 33 are secessionist.54 War participants and locations are evenly distributed
across space, with the exception of Oceania, which remained peaceful. Eight percent of the
inter-state war-years between 1816 and 1913 involved African countries, 23% Asian, 48%
European, 20% Latin American, and 1% North American.55 Little military conflict occurred
in the European territory (consistent with the characterization of the Hundred Year’s Peace),
while in other regions, most prominently Asia and Latin America, war was pervasive (and
often involved European powers).56
For every war, I establish whether it was waged while having access to international lend
ing. A natural way to proceed is to focus on default periods; however, this measure—or
interest spreads or gold standard adoption—is endogenous.57 To gain leverage on identifi
cation, I exploit shocks in the international lending markets throughout the long nineteenth
century. As it will become clear, these credit crunches, also known as “sudden stops” of
credit,58 dried up capital flows at once on a global scale. Key for the identification strategy,
sudden stops precluded countries from external borrowing irrespective of their (un)observed
characteristics. In other words,
[b]anking crises in global financial centers (and the credit crunches that accompany them) produce a ’sudden stop’ of lending to countries at the periphery [...]. Essentially, capital flows from the ’north’ dry up in a manner unrelated to the underlying economic fundamentals in emerging markets. (Reinhart and Rogoff 2009 2009:74, italics added).
The empirical section exploits sudden stops as a form of exogenous variation in access to
external credit, which in turn structures the incentives to invest in fiscal capacity for countries
at war. Notice that these shocks are captured by the loan supply shifter αs introduced in
Section 2. Contractions of global credit, αs < α′

α′
s > 1, incentives to finance war with tax money are strongest. Next, I elaborate on the
nature and timing of these shocks.
3.3 The Globalization of Capital
The nineteenth century witnessed the first globalization of financial markets, resulting
from excess savings generated by the industrial revolution in Western Europe.59 Relative to
world GDP, the volume of cross-border loans was three times larger in 1880s than a hundred
years later.60 Old and newly created states financed externally at very favorable conditions.
Countries in the periphery paid a premium for their lack of reputation;61 however this was
historically low: First, drawing on annual interest rates from 1870 to 1914, Bordon and
Rockoff show that developing nations paid between 2 and 3% premium relative to British
Consols;62 for reference, the United States paid a 1% premium. By the eve of WWI, the
gap between British Consols and sovereign debt from the periphery had closed by half.63
Second, spreads between developed and developing nations were between two to four times
smaller in 1877-1913 than in 1994-2000.64 That is, capital was significantly cheaper for
developing economies at the turn of the nineteenth century than at the turn of the twentieth
century. Third, rates paid by new states in the nineteenth century were significantly smaller
than those paid by European powers in premodern times, when they lacked strong economic
fundamentals. The average nominal yield in the 15th–17th centuries in Castile, France and
the UK were 8.75, 7.25, and 7.78, respectively.65 In stark contrast, no Latin American
economy paid nominal interests above 6% by the turn of the nineteenth century.66 Given

the relative low price of money in the nineteenth century, it is not surprising that peripheral
countries financed war externally.67
A detailed account of the reasons that made money relatively inexpensive in the nine
teenth century far exceeds the limits of this piece. Briefly put, the literature points to four
nonmutually exclusive factors: First, at the margin, the higher premium charged on devel
oping nations worked as a pull factor, while low interest rates in the UK also pushed capital
out.68 Second, the “lending frenzy” was sustained on strong information asymmetries, spec
ulative operations, and blatant fraud.69 Investors would inform their decisions based on the
economic press published in London; however, this press did not establish full-time corre
spondents overseas until the late in the game.70 Third, over time investors received more and
more guarantees from foreign governments—probably in response to a context of frequent
default. Loans increasingly incorporated clauses by which governments committed entire
revenue sources to the payment of foreign debt. Fourth, default settlements increasingly
involved the exchange of war debt for land, state monopolies, and other assets, which also
minimized risk for investors. Indeed, Appendix A shows that the anticipated exchange of
old bonds for equity decreases the interest rate of countries with a history of default.
Most of the international credit was channeled through the London Stock Exchange
(LSE). Its leadership was consolidated throughout the nineteenth century, when it became
the world’s leading capital exporter, far exceeding the combined capital exports of its nearest
competitors—France and Germany. Table 1 reports the best approximation of the market
shares in lending throughout this period. At its peak, the British share of total global for
eign investment was almost 80%. This contrasts with the US share of global assets of 25%
67Centeno 2002, Flandreau and Flores 2012, and Marichal 1989 list over 25 wars that were explicitly financed with war loans by peripheral countries in Asia, Eurasia, Latin America, and Southern Europe in the long nineteenth century. 68See Bordo and Rockoff 1996, p.396 for a review of this literature. 69Taylor 2006. 70Jones 1979 shows that The Times, a key source of financial information in London, did not have a permanent correspondent in Argentina, a key market, until the 1890s. Instead, they relied on local sources that often had conflict of interest.

in 2000 and even with the US maximum share of 50% circa 1960. Consistently, at that time
the British were known as “the bankers of the world.”71
The LSE was not immune to crisis. Table 2 enumerates the onset of all banking panics
and stock crashes experienced by Great Britain in the long nineteenth century as listed in
Reinhart and Rogoff.72 Given Great Britain’s central position in the international lending
market, crashes in London rapidly spread to Paris, Frankfurt, and New York. Contagion took
different routes, including arbitrage in commodities and securities and movement of money
in various forms (specie, bank deposits, bill of exchange), cooperation among monetary
authorities, and pure psychology.73 One way or another, financial crashes in London dried
up international lending on a global scale.74
Importantly for exogeneity purposes, the causes of the British financial collapses in the
nineteenth century are domestic. This is certainly the case for the major crises of 1825,
1847, 1857, and 1866 but less true for the 1890 panic, in which a large financial imbalance
in Argentina halted British lending.75 More importantly, British panics did not respond

to defaults by borrowers, which would cast doubt on the exogeneity of these shocks. Most
of the countries that defaulted in the nineteenth century were in the periphery. Although
the defaulted quantities were significant relative to their home economies from a global
prospective, they were a “sideshow” for the British economy.76 All things considered, the
periods of sudden stops can be safely treated as exogenous to every country except Great
Britain and, arguably, 1890 Argentina.

For the purposes of illustration, Figure 1 shows the evolution of British capital exports
since earliest date while indicating the years of banking panics and stock crises as dated by
Reinhart and Rogoff.77 Figure 1 reflects the boom-and-bust cycles preceding and following
a banking crisis as exemplified by the financial crises of 1873 and 1890. Prior to each bust,
lending was ferocious. Once the debt bubble burst, international capital flows temporarily
dried up across the board. Precisely, during periods of sudden stop, I expect rulers to have
strong incentives to finance military campaigns by means other than external borrowing,
namely taxes.78
To assess the unanticipated nature of sudden stops, Table 3 shows the frequency and
duration of war during periods in which international loans flow and dry up.79 If sudden
stops are predictable, more war should occur in periods in which credit flows; yet 52% of
war-years coincide with periods in which the international lending market is down.80 In
addition, Figure A-7 in Appendix W shows no increase in war right before the onset of credit
crunches, consistent with the unanticipated nature of sudden stops.

Results hold. 79Table A-7 lists a complete tally of war and capital access at the country level. 80The distribution of war-years having and lacking access to foreign capital within region is also fairly distributed despite the sample size drop: 39% of war-years in Africa were fought lacking access to capital, 48% in Asia, 54% in Europe, 59% in Latin America, and 40% in North-America.
19


credit may be more prone to surrender during sudden stops. If that is the case, weak states
would end up with a higher proportion of war-years when credit flows and lower proportion
of war-years during sudden stops. This would bias the estimation results toward finding a
negative effect of war for years when credit flows. If this pattern was systematic, on average,
we should observe shorter wars during sudden-stop periods, precisely because many wars in
this period involved a Great Power against a developing country. However, Table 3 suggests
that the duration of war in and outside sudden stops is balanced: 2.24 years in periods
of sudden stop compared to 2.31 years when credit flows. When secessionist wars are also
considered (Columns 3 and 4), duration is virtually balanced.
If war is judged by its frequency and duration, Table 3 suggests a comparison of apples
to apples when tackling war waged during periods in which international lending flows and
war waged in episodes of sudden stop of credit. A final caveat involves the source of the
variation of warfare and capital access. Above I showed that warfare took place all around
the world, with the exception of Oceania. Capital imports from Britain were also a pervasive
phenomenon, involving sovereign countries and colonial dominions, British and non-British.
From 1865-9, government bodies and enterprises in 65 nations sought funds in Great Britain;
by 1914, this number had risen to 120.81 Africa received 12% of all government loans (in
£000 value) for the period from 1865 to 1914; Asia 20%, Europe 18%, Latin America 18%,
Oceania 15%, and North America 15%.82 Thirteen percent of these loans were intended
for military ends (the rest being invested in public works and transportation). All things
considered, the nineteenth century offers an ideal setting in terms of geographic distribution
of warfare and capital imports to study the effect of war making and external finance on
state making.

3.4 Specification
Sudden stops in the nineteenth century lasted, on average, four years.83 Accordingly, I
establish four-year windows following the onset of each sudden stop and assume that within
these windows countries had no access to external loans.84 For each of these periods of
time, I count the number of years that country i is at war. To fully test the theoretical
expectation, I also compute the number of years that a country is at war while credit flows
in the international market.85 Then, I regress various proxies of fiscal capacity circa 2000
on the number of years at war in the long nineteenth century having and lacking access to
external finance as exogenized by sudden stops:86
Long-Run Fiscal Capacityi = α + β1(#years at war between 1816-1913 | no access to external loans)
+β2(#years at war between 1816-1913 | access to external loans)
+Xiδ + γ + ρ + i
(4)
I consider three proxies for long-run fiscal capacity: First, Personal Income Tax (PIT).
Implementing a PIT requires a sophisticated bureaucratic apparatus capable of assessing
a highly atomized tax base, enforcing compliance and sanctioning defectors. In light of
its administrative challenges, this tax is considered to be the endpoint of fiscal capacity
building.87 Accordingly, it sets a clear benchmark to establish how far each country has gone
in building tax capacity. In the empirical analysis, I work with average PIT to GDP ratios
between 1995 and 2005 to minimize the effect of anomalous observations.88
Because PIT might capture both capacity and willingness to tax, a second outcome
variable is considered, one that emphasizes the infrastructural component of fiscal capacity:
83Catao 2006. 84Refer to Appendix I for windows of longer duration. Longer windows can be interpreted as a placebo test. Accordingly, results hold but turn weaker as windows expand. 85A given war might be fought entirely while credit flows, while credit dries up, or across periods. In the latter case, I split war-years proportionally across periods. Refer to Appendix C for the distribution of both counts per country. 86The analysis is cross-sectional because for most countries time-varying tax data does not exist for the nineteenth century. 87Besley and Persson 2011; Tilly 1990. 88Appendix B lists all data sources. PIT data availability caps the sample size to 107 countries.
21


the Size of the Tax Administration circa 2005, measured as the number of staff employed by
the tax administration per thousand capita. Finally, I also proxy long-term fiscal capacity
with Value-Added Taxes (VAT), now standard also in the developing world.89
Following the discussion at the beginning of this Section, I expect war making to strengthen
the ruler’s incentives to invest in fiscal capacity whenever the country cannot finance ex
ternally, contributing to long-term fiscal capacity, β1 > 0.90 By contrast, in light of the
commitment problems in war-debt repayment, I expect a null (if not negative) effect of war
making when countries wage war having access to external credit, β2 6 0. A negative sign for
β2 would suggest that the fiscal disequilibrium associated with excess borrowing combined,
potentially, with the exchange of state monopolies for default settlements, may fully reverse
the effect of war on state making.91
Three clarifications are in order: First, the expectation β2 6 0 works against the Ricardian
equivalence, which assumes no commitment problem in debt repayment. Based on that logic,
borrowing and taxes are equivalent in the long run, implying β1 ≈ β2 > 0, everything else
constant. Second, in the absence of external credit, rulers might resort to printing money,
domestic loans, or financial repression to finance the means of war. If any, these alternatives
introduce a downward bias on β1 because they weaken the incentives to enhance taxation
in times when external credit dries up.92 Third, crucial for the quasi-experimental setting,
sudden stops are predictable only ex post, as I discussed in the immediately preceding section;
but suppose that some rulers had inside information and banked external loans in anticipation
of sudden stops. Then one should expect no investment in fiscal capacity when financial
markets are down. If any, anticipation creates an attenuation bias on β1.
As part of Expression 4, all models below include a battery of region fixed effects, γ,
that account for continent-specific characteristics in the frequency of war, access to credit,
89VAT models are reported in Appendix M. Results are equivalent for the three outcome variables. 90The baseline category is fighting no war in the nineteenth century. Forty-eight percent of the sampled states fought no interstate or secessionist war in the long nineteenth century. 91Refer to Appendix D for models in which β1 and β2 are estimated separately. Results hold. 92Appendix K considers two of these alternatives: domestic credit and money printing.
22


and statehood timing;93 and a battery of Colonial Origins indicators, ρ, because I expect
the colonies’ opportunities to go to war, the tax structure that they build up, and the terms
of external credit to be conditioned by the metropolis.94 Relatedly, Appendix N reruns the
analysis after dropping former British colonies (and military allies) from the sample, given
their privileged relationship with the financial capital of the world. Results hold.
In addition, all models include a vector of potential confounders, X, affecting fiscal
capacity today as well as war participation, credit access, or both, back in the nineteenth
century. First, I consider a measure of initial wealth because wealthier countries are more
likely to go to war and have stronger fiscal capacity in the first place.95 In the absence of
systematic GDP data for the early nineteenth century, I include a measure of Population
Density as of 1820, which is argued to be the best proxy of a country’s wealth in the early
nineteenth century96 Second, I also include two geographic characteristics that could affect
both sides of the equation. The first one, Sea Access, is the percentage of the land surface
area of each country that is within 100km of the nearest ice-free coast. I expect sea access
to correlate with trade activity (thus access to international lending) and monetization,
a precondition for modern taxation.97 By the same token, I expect territories with sea
access to be militarily valuable, thus increasing their likelihood of experiencing war. The
second geographic control is the percentage of territory that is Desert. I expect deserts to
inhibit industrial growth and preempt monetization, but desert territory might also work as
a natural barrier to foreign invasion, thus reducing the frequency of war. Finally, I control
for an important source of nontax revenue that could also shape the incentives to go to war
(or suffer attack): being an Oil Producer. Arguably, this variable gains relevance for the
later years of the period under consideration. Two additional geographic conditions, Terrain
Ruggedness and Land Area, are evaluated in Appendix L, where they are interpreted as

geographic determinants of initial political conditions.98
4 Addressing Endogeneity in External Credit Access
In Table 4, I use the periods of sudden stop to identify periods in which rulers of warring
states have stronger incentives to enhance their fiscal foundations. Great Britain—the banker
of the world—is excluded from every model to maximize exogeneity.99
To establish a benchmark, Column 1 tests for the unconditional version of the bellicist
hypothesis; that is, does long-term fiscal capacity increase with the number of years at war
in the long nineteenth century? Or more generally, does war make states? With a 90%
confidence interval, Personal Income Tax (PIT) today increases in the number of years at
war in the long ninteenth century, holding everything constant. This result confirms those
in Dincecco and Prado.100
Column 1 should be compared to Column 2, in which I distinguish the effect of war
fought without access to external credit, β1, from war fought with access to international
lending markets, β2. Consistent with the political economy of war finance, βˆ1 is positive and
significantly different from zero. A one standard deviation increase in the number of years at
war while international lending stops increases PIT today by 49% with respect to the sample
mean. By contrast, a one standard deviation increase in the number of years at war when
credit flowed decreases average PIT today by 31.4%. This result suggests that debt-financed
war might create fiscal imbalances that are too hard to fix. These should be strongest among
states that hand over state monopoly revenues to lenders in order to regain market access
after defaulting.101
The opposite signs of βˆ1 and βˆ2, plotted in Figure 2, suggest that the effect of war esti
mated in Column 1, the unconditional hypothesis, is the average of two radically different

states. More important than war itself is the way that it is financed. The remaining columns
in this and subsequent tables establish how robust this result is to endogeneity bias, sam
ple selection, and measurement decisions, while making sure not to control for endogenous
covariates to war making (e.g., Per Capita GDP).102

(b) War while Credit Flows
The first potential confounder, being a Great Power in the nineteenth century, is examined
in Column 3. This control accounts for the idiosyncratic paths of state and war making in
the Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary, and Russia.103 These countries
were major military and economic powers in the nineteenth century and could drive results.
The coefficient of this indicator variable is positive and statistically significant. Importantly,
βˆ1 and βˆ2 remain the same.
War causes destruction, but damages vary greatly depending on the location of military
engagement. The tax base can be badly hurt when military conflict takes place within
national boundaries, thus inhibiting investment in fiscal capacity. The location of war is
thus likely to be a confounding variable. To address this logic, Column 4 in Table 4 controls

for the location of conflict. In particular, War Location is the sum of the years at war fought
abroad minus the years at war fought at home from 1816 to 1913. This variable is positive
when a country fights more wars abroad than at home; negative, when military disputes
at home are more frequent than abroad; or zero, when countries never go to war.104 The
coefficient for this variable is positive, as one would expect, but not statistically significant.
The coefficients βˆ1 and βˆ2 remain unchanged.
All wars are not created equal. Bloodier and longer wars might overcome resistance to
taxation while maximizing the ruler’s incentives to invest in fiscal capacity. To address this
possibility, Column 5 and 6 include a control for the intensity of warfare, measured by the
number of battle deaths during the period, Casualties from 1816 to 1913,105 and the average
War Duration during the period. These variables are not statistically significant even though
their presence, if only marginally, pushes up the magnitude of βˆ1, the effect of war fought
while having no access to external credit. Drawn from a different dataset, War Outcome is
addressed in Table 7.
Next, I consider the reputation of each country in the international market. That is, on
top of capital flowing in London, a state’s ability to finance war with external loans might
depend on its reputation of default.106 To account for that, Column 7 adjusts for the Number
of Years in Default between 1816 and 1913 of each country. This variable is not statistically
different from zero, which is consistent with the “lending frenzy” that characterizes this
period.107 Importantly, the two coefficients of interest remain unchanged.
Columns 8 and 9 control for Ethnic Fractionalization and nonsecessionist Civil Wars.
Ethnic fractionalization might be an impediment to invest in fiscal capacity108 while increas
ing vulnerability to foreign intervention. In the absence of better data, ethnic fractionaliza
104To capture any potential negative effect of war within the domestic territory, both inter-state and secessionist wars are considered in computing War Location. Only one country fought the same number of wars at home and abroad. Results are virtually identical if the total number of wars fought abroad or at home are fitted separately. 105Dincecco and Prado 2012. 106Tomz 2007. 107Taylor 2006. 108Besley and Persson 2011.

tion is measured as of the 2000s and is potentially endogenous to war.109 A long history of
Civil War is a strong predictor of negative patterns of development,110 but lacking political
stability might be penalized by the credit markets. Controlling for civil war, however, is
far from ideal because sometimes it results from interstate war. At the risk of incurring in
posttreatment bias, Columns 8 and 9 control for the level of ethnic fractionalization today
and the number of years at civil wars between 1813 and 1916, respectively.111 The marginal
effect of both controls is positive and in the case of civil wars, also statistically different from
zero. Key for the theoretical argument, the inclusion of these variables does not modify the
point estimates of β1 and β2.
Scheve and Stasavage show that progressive taxation, including PIT, accelerated dra
matically among WWI participants.112 Including the latter covariate in the empirical model
might lead to posttreatment bias if countries that frequently went to war in the nineteenth
century and developed higher fiscal capacity by 1913 selected into WWI. Still, one might
be tempted to include a WWI Participant indicator to check whether the coefficients of
interest survive this control. Column 10 indicates that they do. The coefficient for WWI
sets a meaningful benchmark to compare conventional war making in the long nineteenth
century with. WWI’s marginal effect on fiscal capacity is 1.3 points, whereas a one standard
deviation increase in the number of years at war while having no access to external credit
increases average PIT today by 1.4 points. Results are virtually equivalent, meaning that
sufficient years of conventional warfare—as long as they are (at least partially) financed with
taxes—exert lasting effects equivalent to participation in total war.
Finally, under a median voter framework, one should observe higher tax rates in democ
racies than in autocracies, everything else constant. Democracies also present a comparative
advantage in external financing.113 In addition, Section 2 showed that the ruler’s decision
109Table A-11 in Appendix G includes a control for the Federal structure of the state as of today, which might reflect accumulated ethnic fractionalization. 110Besley and Reynal-Querol 2014. 111To minimize bias, civil wars that take place simultaneously with interstate wars are not considered. 112Scheve and Stasavage 2010. 113Schultz and Weingast 2003.

also depended on initial political institutions. Either reason recommends controlling for ini
tial democracy levels. Except for a handful of cases, however, democracy scores by 1820 are
unavailable in any systematic way. In view of this limitation, Appendix L shows results for
the subsample of cases for which these data are available. Despite the reduced sample size,
results hold.
To sum up, Table 4 suggests that war does not necessarily make states. It all depends
on the incentives that rulers have to invest in fiscal capacity, which, I argue, are weaker
when they have access to external loans and strong when the do not. Before discussing
the implications of this result, Tables 5–7 address additional measurement and endogeneity
considerations.
4.1 Military Powers, Sovereign States, Secessionist War, and Al
ternative Outcome Variables
This section addresses four potential issues: Are results driven by big military powers?
Is the effect of war equivalent in sovereign and nonsovereign states? Does the theory apply
to wars of independence? Does war finance shape infrastructural transformations in the long
run?
Rulers decide whether to finance the means of war with taxes or external loans. As I argue
above, this decision is a function of opportunity (i.e., the political economy of war-finance)
and possibility. In that respect, less capable states should be most tempted to finance the
means of war externally, specially in a context of massive cross-border lending. By the same
token, they should be particularly exposed to the perverse incentives of external financing.
To address this point, Columns 1 and 2 in Table 5 rerun the baseline models, dropping
first the Great Powers, and then, four additional wealthy countries: the Netherlands, the
United States, Canada, and Japan. In both specifications, the point estimate for β1 remains
unchanged with respect to Table 4, suggesting that war makes states in the periphery as long
29


as it is not financed with external loans.114
So far, wars are attributed to the corresponding 2001 nation-state irrespective of whether
that territory had achieved statehood by 1913. One could argue that war fought by states
unrecognized by the international system exerts a different (or null) effect on fiscal capacity.
For instance, colonies might not invest in their military campaigns as much as the metropo
lis.115 To address this possibility, Columns 3 and 4 in Table 5 rerun the analysis considering
only countries that were sovereign by war time. Results, despite the reduction of the sample
size, are similar to those reported in Table 4. Sovereign states that waged war while inter
national lending flowed are not associated with high fiscal capacity today. To the contrary,
sovereign states that waged war in the midst of a sudden stop have, on expectation, higher
tax capacity today.
Some countries in the periphery waged secessionist war in the nineteenth century. The
object of these wars was the formation of an independent modern nation-state. Financing
secessionist war might exert effects similar to regular warfare; moreover, including them
in the analysis might better reflect the universe of states at war during the period under
consideration. Consistently, Columns 5 to 6 in Table 5 suggest that waging war, either
interstate or secessionist, when international lending stops, is associated with long-run fiscal
capacity.
A fourth battery of sensitivity tests addresses the choice of the outcome variable. PIT
ratios arguably capture both capacity and willingness to tax, moreover, they vary with the
economic cycle. To address both issues, I use an alternative proxy of fiscal capacity, one
that emphasizes administrative capacity over willingness: the Size of the Tax Administra
tion. First, this variable is a strong predictor of tax yields as shown in Appendix B. Second,
unlike tax ratios, the size of the tax administration does not change with the economic cycle,
not in the short run. Third, tax bureaucracies are filled with public servants, subject to
stricter controls, and relatively sheltered from spurious fleeting interests of passing incum

bents. These characteristics suggest that the size of the tax apparatus genuinely captures
the underlying capacity to monitor and assess private income.116
Next, I regress the size of the tax administration, measured by the Tax Staff per Thousand
Capita circa 2005, on the same set of covariates used to model long-term income tax ratios.
Results in Columns 7 and 8 in Table 5 mimic previous ones: Waging war without access to
external credit (exogenized by instances of sudden stops) is associated with a more staffed tax
administration today; war waged while credit flows is not. For additional robustness tests,
Appendix Table A-18 shows models of VAT as a percentage of GDP. Results are equivalent.
5 Addressing Endogeneity in War Participation
The decision to go to war can also be endogenous. First, countries that go to war might
have greater administrative capacity to begin with (i.e., omitted variable bias). Second, the
type of country that goes to war when credit is tight may differ in ways that are relevant
to future tax capacity from those that wait until loans are available (i.e., selection bias). I
address both issues stepwise.
5.1 Initial State Capacity
Countries that are frequently at war may have greater capacity to conscript and tax. Im
portantly, the ruler’s foregone utility of financing war with tax revenue is smaller when initial
state capacity is higher as shown in Section 2. These capacities may already be captured by
the Great Power indicator and the proxy of initial wealth: Population Density as of 1820.
After all, we know that the income level is a strong predictor of war participation.117 Next,
I further minimize bias by considering two covariates associated with initial state capacity:
Bockstette, Chanda, and Putterman’s State Antiquity Index ;118 and Census Capacity. The

former should correlate with cumulative military and administrative capacity because older
states exist as a result of winning war in the past. The latter should correlate (if not facili
tate) preparation for war if only because modern censuses tend to follow earlier enumerations
in which taxable wealth and the conscription base are assessed. To this end, I have coded the
date of the first modern census ever conducted for every country in the sample. To control
for initial administrative capacity, I create the indicator variable Modern Census by 1820,
which equals 1 if country i has conducted a modern census by 1820.
33


Results are reported in Columns 1 and 2 of Table 6. The two new covariates hold positive
coefficients, as expected, but are not statistically significant.119 Importantly, once I control
for both proxies of initial state capacity, βˆ1 and βˆ2 remain positive and negative, respectively,
and statistically significant. That is, independent of observable initial capacity to prepare
for war and raise taxes, only war waged when the international lending market was down
contributed to build fiscal capacity in the long run.
5.2 Ongoing Wars
Countries that go to war despite the credit crunch may differ from countries that wait
for markets to lend again. Table 3 and Appendix Figure A-7 show no evidence of strategic
timing of war making once credit access is exogenized: The frequency and duration of war
inside and outside sudden stop periods are virtually balanced (and war participation does
not increase immediately before the onset of credit crunches). Still, following the onset
of a sudden stop, states might choose whether to wage war or what kind of war to fight.
Alternatively, peripheral states might have more leeway in deciding which war to fight when
the metropolis is experiencing a financial crisis.120 I address these forms of selection bias by
considering only wars that are initiated while the market is still lending and eventually dries
up as a result of a financial crisis. These are wars that are initiated without the expectation
of a sudden stop. Thus, the decision to go to war or what type of war to fight is disconnected
from external credit access.121
Columns 3 to 5 in Table 6 show the results of this test. The estimate for βˆ1 decreases with
respect to Table 4, suggesting that the latter may be somewhat upward biased. Based on
the new estimate, a one standard deviation increase in the number of ongoing wars increases
long-term average PIT by 12.5%, a sizable effect. By contrast, βˆ2 is no longer negative
but zero, which is still inconsistent with the unconditional interpretation of the bellicist
119Models including State Antiquity miss three observations because of data availability. 120I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer for this observation. 121The 222 country-year-wars taking place during sudden stops falls to 72 once I consider only wars that are ongoing by the onset of a sudden stop.
34


hypothesis (and the Ricardian equivalence).122
5.3 Noninitiators, War Outcome, and COW data
Another route to minimize selection is to study the effect of war making and credit access
for states that choose not to go to war but are dragged into it. One could argue that countries
that initiate war are different from those that are attacked in ways that shape long-term fiscal
capacity. Based on this logic, I estimate separately the effect of war making and credit access
for countries that are attacked, namely the noninitiators. The identification assumption is
that initiators do not strike first in anticipation of a likely attack.
To conduct this test, I rely on the COW dataset, which identifies the initiator of each
military conflict.123 The COW dataset includes fewer interstate wars than Wimmer and
Min because it follows stricter criteria about what a state in the nineteenth century is.124
Accordingly, the sample of interstate wars is now made of 37 conflicts, and 172 country-year
wars in total. Seventy-eight were fought when credit flowed, and 96 when credit had suddenly
stopped. Average war duration was 1.57 (sd=1.04) and 1.76 (sd=1.23) years, respectively.
COW facilitates information to control for war outcome. This is substantively compelling
because military outcomes potentially affect the incentives to invest in fiscal capacity; for
example, winners might extract from losers. To this end, Net Victory indicates the number
of wars won between 1816 and 1913 by country i net of wars lost during the same period.
Countries that fought no war have a value of 0.125
Table 7 begins by replicating the effect of war and credit access for the entire COW
sample, including initiator and noninitiators. The effects reported in Columns 1 and 2 are
slightly lower than those estimated in Table 4. Based on Column 1, a one standard deviation
increase in the number of years at war fought while having no access to credit increases
122Appendix O shows that results hold when the ongoing war filter is implemented and the sample is limited to peripheral countries. 123Sarkees and Wayman 2010. 124Wimmer and Min 2009. Refer to Appendix B for further details. 125Three countries won the same number of wars that they lost: Bulgaria, Spain, and Turkey. All other zeros correspond to countries that fought no war within the period.

average PIT today by 25.7%. Most likely, the decrease of this estimate with respect to Table
4 results from sample selection in COW, which overrepresents wealthier countries, for which
additional years at war should exert a relatively smaller effect. Importantly, Columns 1 and
2 imply that results are robust to sample change.
In Columns 3 and 4, I estimate the effect of war and credit access for countries that did
not choose to go to war but were pushed into it. Results are similar to the preceding ones,
only bigger. Countries that were dragged into war in the midst of a sudden stop of credit
present higher levels of fiscal capacity today. The effect vanishes when countries are allowed
to borrow external loans to finance war. Importantly, results are robust to war outcome:
Winning or losing wars does not significantly modify the differential effect of war making
and credit access on long-term fiscal capacity.
Appendix P reports and additional test in which I address selection bias in war partici
pation in a reduced-form format. Specifically, war participation by country i is replaced by
that of adjacent countries, a designed inspired in Gennaioli and Voth.126 Results hold.
One final caveat: War is assumed exogenous in the decision-theoretical model in Section 2,
yet rulers may strategically initiate war to overcome resistance to taxation without granting
policy concessions—a rally-round-the-flag strategy so to speak. The fiscal effect of this
strategy should be transient. Maintaining high levels of taxation is hard if taxpayers cannot
constrain the ruler’s discretion on fiscal matters.127 If the ruler initiates war to avoid policy
concessions the mechanism that sustains high levels of taxation over time—power-sharing
institutions—will not be set in motion either. Empirically, we should not observe long-term
persistence of the effect of war on fiscal capacity. Endogeneity of war of this sort introduces
a downward bias on the main coefficient of interest, β1.

6 Short-Term Effects
I have argued that tax-financed war exerts long-term effects on fiscal capacity because
it pushes rulers to conduct fiscal reform. If fiscal capacity building is gradual, one should
observe some evidence of this in the short term. In the absence of tax data for current devel
oping economies in the early twentieth century, I work with two measures of state capacity
that correlate with tax capacity: The ability to conduct a Modern Census and Primary
School Enrollment, both dated as of 1913. The former measure is clearly a requirement to
adopt modern forms of direct taxation because it establishes the potential tax base. The
latter measure captures a cornerstone characteristic of the modern state: Public-funded mass
education, which requires a solid bureaucratic structure to recruit instructors and standardize
curricula.128 Importantly, we can expect different dimensions of state capacity to correlate:
They are presumed complementary, not substitutes.129
Columns 1 and 2 in Table 8 report a probit model in which having a modern census by
1913 is regressed on war making and exogenous credit access between 1816 and 1913 plus
controls. Results suggest that waging war during the long ninteenth century increases the
probability of having a modern census by 1913 only in the absence of external finance.
Columns 3 and 4 fit an OLS model in which the Date of Adoption of the first modern
census is regressed on the baseline covariates. In this model high values of the dependent
variable imply delays in census adoption. Results show that fighting wars in times of sudden
stop accelerates adoption. Fighting wars having access to credit does not. If any, it increases
delay.
Appendix R runs duration models of census adoption as a function of war and credit
access between 1816 and 1913. Those models, which exploit longitudinal variation in credit
access, war, and key covariates, yield similar results: Capital access discourages the adoption

Results in Columns 5 to 7, in which I model the primary school enrollment by 1913,
mimic previous results: War making while credit flows does not predict higher enrollment
ratios by 1913, whereas war making while credit stops does. Importantly, results are robust
to state antiquity and initial enrollment ratios.130
7 Evidence of Transmission
Does the effect of war finance travel over time, and why? In this section, I show evidence
of transmission, then advance a political transmission mechanism. First, I show transmission
by studying the effect of nineteenth-century war finance on post-WWII tax capacity. Given
data constraints, to proxy fiscal capacity, I rely on the share of total tax revenue that is
not accrued from trade taxes. This share measures the effort to raise revenue through
sophisticated taxes (e.g., the income tax) instead of tariffs, a tax handle that low-capacity
countries often use.
To assess transmission, first I compute decennial averages of nontrade taxes as percent
of total taxation from 1945 to 1995; then, I regress those ratios on the number of years at
war having and lacking access to external loans in the nineteenth century plus controls (i.e.,
Expression 4).131 Figure 3 summarizes results.
The left plot shows that waging war in the nineteenth century with access to credit is not
associated with post-WWII fiscal capacity, whereas waging war lacking access to external
finance is (right plot). Approximately, an additional year at war in the nineteenth century
lacking external finance increases post-WWII nontrade tax revenue by 1%, else constant.
This result suggests that the effects reported in Tables 4–8 persist throughout the twentieth
130Appendix S considers a third proxy of state capacity by 1913: the length of open rail lines. 131Data for nontrade tax revenue is limited. The small N does not allow to fit region- and colony-fixed effects. To minimize unobserved heterogeneity across units, I include a Former Colonial Status indicator, which collapses the three previous dummy variables (British, Iberian, and Other Colonies) into one, and the Great Power indicator, which adjusts for the systematic difference of European core powers. In addition, I include a control for initial wealth (proxied by Population Density in 1820 ), Oil Production, and Sea Access. Results in regression format can be found in Appendix T.

7.1 Transmission Mechanism
The fiscal effect of war travels over time. Why? The theory section states that the effect
of war on long-run fiscal capacity is transmitted via a political channel. The connection
between war finance and political reform has a long tradition in the literature.132 In order
to finance the means of war, rulers may willingly share power over spending decisions to
overcome taxpayers’ resistance to increased taxation.
Power-sharing institutions facilitate transmission of the war effect because they transform
taxation into a nonzero-sum game—revenue is secured by the ruler, whom taxpayers hold
fiscally accountable—facilitating sustained investment in tax capacity.133 The findings so far
suggest, however, that incentives to finance war with taxes—thus chances of observing move
ments toward power-sharing institutions—are weak when countries have access to external
132Bates and Lien 1985; Cox 2012; Dincecco 2011; Ferejohn and Rosenbluth 2016; Hoffman and Rosenthal 2000; Stasavage 2016; Tilly 1990. 133Besley and Persson 2011.

finance. By contrast, war should contribute most decisively to political reform—and activate
the political mechanism of transmission—when it is waged while having no access to exter
nal finance. This argument is consistent with the resource curse literature, and specifically
with Downing’s interpretation of state making and political reform in early modern Europe:
Countries that systematically relied on ore from colonies to finance military campaigns (e.g.,
Spain) bypassed parliament and did not develop tax capacity.134
Figure 4 lends support to the political mechanisms. It shows that Executive Con
straints—the expected outcome of the political bargaining over taxation—are positively as
sociated with waging war while lacking external finance, both in the short and long run. A
one standard deviation increase in the number of years at war while credit is tight in the
nineteenth century increases average executive constraints by 16% in 1913 and 4.5% in the
2000s.135 By contrast, war waged while having access to external credit is not associated
with political change in the short or long run. If any, that relationship is negative.
In sum, Figure 4 suggests that war facilitates political reform when incumbents cannot
escape the political costs of domestic taxation, namely when they lack external finance.
Political reform, in turn, transforms taxation into a win–win game, facilitating long-term
persistence.136
8 Discussion
Contrary to the unconditional characterization of the bellicist hypothesis, that is, more
war, more state, I argue—alongside Tilly’s original work—that the effect of war on state
building ultimately depends on how warfare is financed. Specifically, I claim that financing
war with taxes is conducive to state-making, whereas financing wars with external loans may
not because of two extended practices to dodge the Ricardian equivalence: debt relief and

the exchange of old bonds for state monopolies and nontax revenue.
Building on Centeno and Thies, I emphasize the radically different international context
in which countries in the periphery are created as compared to that faced by European
nations in early modern times.137 Most states in the periphery were founded only after 1815,
coinciding with the globalization of financial markets, resulting from the income growth in
the wake of the industrial revolution and Britain’s capacity to spin off excess savings to
the rest of the world. Unlike European states, from their very inception the new states in
the periphery had access to unprecedented inexpensive external finance despite their weak
institutionalization, frequent government turnover, and lack of reputation in the international
markets. The lending frenzy stopped abruptly in 1914. By then, however, many externally
financed wars had already been fought.
Cheap external credit strengthened incentives to finance war externally while preempting
the development of domestic credit markets, thus the formation of a corpus of domestic
lenders with whom to strike bargains conducive to political reform and long-term fiscal
capacity.138 Debt relief and the exchange of old bonds for nontax revenue minimized the
cost of default for developing nations; however it precluded the Ricardian equivalence, thus
state building. Counterintuitively, countries in the periphery may have benefited from less
dynamic international lending markets because that would have strengthened the incentives
to raise taxes to finance the means of war, stimulate domestic borrowing, and conduct the
political reform associated with long-term fiscal capacity—namely, what Europeans were
pushed to do only centuries before, when international credit markets were oligopolistic and
expensive.139
The perverse or unanticipated effects of inexpensive external credit resonate with Tilly’s
original hypothesis by emphasizing the conditional effect of war on credit access: In Europe,
frequent war making and the absence of cheap external credit propelled domestic lending and

eventually political reform that addressed commitment problems in debt repayment.140 Inter
state war combined with domestic lending allowed territorial states to pursue the “coercive
capital intensive” (or fiscal–military) strategy that ended in the modern tax state.141 By
contrast, states that kept relying on external loans to finance war found it much harder to
capitalize the effect of war on state making, for example, Spain under Phillip II.142 Access to
cheap external credit—which countries in the periphery had since their inception—distorted
the causal chain of the original bellicist hypothesis. Readily available external loans and
extended practice of debt relief and exchange of old bonds for nontax revenue and state
monopolies weakened the incentives to finance war with taxes and ultimately preempted
the opportunity to capitalize war efforts and conduct political reform. Interestingly, the
perverse incentives associated with cheap loans are similar to those derived from other forms
of nontax revenue: foreign aid,143 oil,144 and ore from colonies.145 Altogether, I establish the
scope conditions under which war exerts positive and lasting effects on state building in the
era of global credit markets.
140Domestic markets were created twofold: By lending from merchants in commercial cities (e.g., Henry IV, 1598-1610, borrowed from Paris and marginalized increasingly expensive Italian lenders) or by coercive annexation of capital-intensive cities (Stasavage, 2011). 141Tilly 1990. 142Drelichman and Voth 2011.

A The Exchange of Old Bonds for Equity as part of
Default Settlements
Along with significant debt relief, default settlements in the first globalization of credit
involved the exchange of land, state monopolies, and other assets—generally referred to as
equity—for old war bonds as part of default settlement. Specifically, defaulters would handle
over land and state monopolies (e.g., salt, railroads) to their lenders as part of the default
settlement (Marichal, 1989). The exchange of nontax revenue for old bonds allowed countries
to regain credit access without enhancing tax capacity, potentially unraveling the Ricardian
equivalence. This Appendix shows that this exchange decreased the price of external loans
and that strengthened the incentives to finance war externally.
First I compute the premium paid when equity (e.g. rents from copper mines) can be
used both to finance war and as collateral in case of default. The lender’s expected return
from lending to a risk-free borrower is (W − N )(1 + r) − (W − N ), and to a non-risk-free
borrower is (1 − d)(1 + r + p)(W − N ) + dN − (W − N ), where d is the risk of default and
(W − N ) is the loan size to finance war. Notice that in case of default, equity is confiscated
by the international investor. Let ψ ∈ {0, 1} denote the market value of equity relative to
war cost, N = ψW . The premium is obtained by setting the expected payoff of lending to a
country with nonzero probability of default equal to the risk-free expected payoff:
p = d(1 + r − ψ(2 + r))
(1 − d)(1 − ψ) (5)
The individual premium is a negative function of the market value of equity (∂p/∂ψ <
0, ∂p/∂2ψ < 0) because the latter will be confiscated in case of default. The effect of default
d depends on ψ: For ψ < (1 + r)/(2 + r), the premium increases with the risk of default. For
(1 + r)/(2 + r) < ψ < 1, the premium decreases with the risk of default. That is, when the
value of equity relative to the war cost is high, the premium will decrease in expectation of
3


default and confiscation of the collateral. This offers a compelling explanation for why the
market would lend to economies with weak fundamentals.
In the presence of equity, the ruler’s present value of taxation becomes
κT + N − W − ct + δ[(κ + η)T + N − ct
] (6)
where equity is also used to finance war. The ruler’s payoff upon financing externally becomes
L + N − W − cl + δ[(1 − d)(κT + N − (1 + i)L − ct
) − dN ] (7)
Plugging (5) into i = r + p, we reach the new condition of loan preference over taxes:
L > κT − ∆c + δ[ηT + (1 − d)L(1 + r) + Ld(1 + r − ψ(2 + r))
1 − ψ + d(κT + 2N − ct)] (8)
which is similar to Expression 3 in the main text except for one important caveat: As the
market value of equity ψ increases, so does preference for external finance (∂RHS/∂ψ <
0, ∂RHS/∂2ψ < 0).
Together, Appendix A shows that once war debt can be exchanged for equity, credit
is offered at lower rates (Expression 5) and the ruler’s incentives to finance war with loans
strengthen (Expression 8), thus expanding the states of the world in which war is financed ex
ternally rather than with taxes, preempting also the activation of the persistence mechanism
of war effects.

B Data Details
1. Personal Income Tax. PIT data (normalized to GDP) is drawn from various sources.
Chief among them is the IMF Global Financial Statistics (GFS). This source provides almost
80% of the data. Consistent with the theoretical claims, I work with PIT raised by the central
government, as war is expected to makes states by centralizing fiscal powers. The GFS data
that I work with refer to cash-accounts (as recommended by the IMF). For the few cases that
these data are not available, I use non-cash values, which correlate at .97 with cash-accounts.
Personal Income Tax data is scarce, even for the IMF. Missing values are filled in with
various sources. Crucially, Column 1 in Table A-1 shows that data augmentation does not
change the point estimates of interest. That is, models that use GFS data only yield the
same results than models that augment GFS data with additional sources.
Cases not covered by the GFS are filled as follows: for Chile, Nicaragua, Ecuador and
Guatemala, data are drawn from the Inter-American Development Bank Dataset;146 for
Nepal, data are drawn from the Ministry of Finance;147 For Sri Lanka, data are drawn from
the Department of Fiscal Policy;148 for Lebanon, data are available from the Ministry of
Finance for the 2000-5 period;149 For Zambia, data are for 2005 only, and are drawn from
CMI Report;150 For Guinea, Rwanda, Chad, Namibia and Yemen, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria,
Philippines, Senegal and Vietnam only 2004 data are drawn from the pilot study of the
USAID Fiscal Reform and Economic Governance Project, 2004-2010. Again, results do not
change as a result of the data augmentation (refer to Column 1 in Table A-1).
To minimize influence of abnormal values, I compute average PIT values as a percentage

of GDP for the 1995-2005 period. This decade maximizes the sample size compared to earlier
and later decades. For robustness, Columns 2 and 3 in Table A-1 show results for slightly
different time periods: 1990-2000 and 2000-2010. Results are the same.
2. Tax staff. The size of the tax administration is drawn from the USAID Fiscal Reform
and Economic Governance Project, 2004-2010. To maximize the sample size, I combine the
values for 2004, 2007-10. This variable is a strong predictor of total tax revenue to GDP
(as drawn from US AID 2008), as Figure A-1 shows. Additionally, it presents advantages
discussed in the main text: e.g., it does not vary with the economic cycle, unlike tax ratios.

3. Census. I coded the date of the first modern census based on Goyer and Draaijer
(1992a,b,c) (abc). Specifically, a modern census requires periodicity, universality, and indi
vidual enumeration by means of house-to-house visitation.
4. WWI participation. The WWI indicator takes value 1 for all countries that actively
participated in WWI (i.e., suffered military casualties).
5. War and Geographical Mapping. The main source of war data is Wimmer and
Min (2009). All inter-state wars included in the analysis are listed in Table A-2. In the few
cases that a country fights more than one war in the same year, I keep the longest war in
the sample. This change fundamentally affects Great Britain (which is always excluded from
the analysis to maximize exogeneity of the sudden stops) and France. Table 5 in the main
text shows that results hold even when France (and other Great Powers) is dropped from
the sample.
Most wars can be easily matched to current state borders thanks to the geographical
location provided in this dataset. For non-obvious matches, I make the following assumptions:
i. Country Splits: This refers to wars attributed by Wimmer and Min (2009) to for
mer political entities that eventually split. Countries affected are: Austria-Hungary,
7


Czechoslovakia, Korea, Peru-Bolivia, and Yugoslavia. To facilitate matching, entries
have been duplicated and attributed evenly across current political units: Austria and
Hungary, Czech Republic and Slovakia, North Korea and South Korea, and Peru and
Bolivia, respectively. Example: suppose that Austria-Hungary fought 5 wars within
1816-1913, then I assign 5 wars to Austria and 5 wars to Hungary. The assumption is
that both entities evenly inherit the fiscal burden and consequences of warfare. Data
for the outcome variable for the constituent parts of former Yugoslavia are missing.
This case is not considered.
ii. Region-to-State Match: see Table A-3
iii. Tentative Match: see Table A-4
iv. Unmatched Units: These are former polities that overlap with more than one state
today. These are not considered in the analysis: Bornu (modern Chad, Niger and
Cameroon), Khanate of Kokand (Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan), Mandingo Empire
(eleven states in West Africa), Oyo (various states in West Africa), Zuku, Tukolor
Empire (Mali, Nigeria and Guinea), Bambara Empire (Guinea and Bali), and Princi
pality of Jammu (China, Tibet, Pakistan).

To this list, I apply country splits (explained above, followed by a ∗) and region-to-state matches (explained above, followed by a †). Units that are tentatively matched (listed in Table A-4, not considered in the main analysis) are followed by a ‡. This table does not include secessionist war (considered only in Columns 5 and 6 in Table 5 in the main text); nor war by unmatched units (listed above, and followed by a ?). Notice that some states are not included in the final sample (e.g., Afghanistan) because of data availability for the rest of covariates.

5. Civil War. Wimmer and Min (2009) differentiate between secessionist and non-secessionist
war.
• Secessionist War: Wimmer and Min’s (2009) dataset attributes war participation to
the colonial power only. I extend their code by attributing war participation to the
territory that seeks independence. After this change the variable remains as listed in
Table A-5. Analysis including these cases in the count of the # of years at war and
credit access are only found in Columns 5 and 6 in Table 5 in the main text.
• Non-Secessionist War: These are considered only as a control. Civil war’s contri
bution to state building is yet to be established. Porter (1994) argues that civil war
was positive for state-building in early modern Europe. Similarly, Balcells and Kalyvas
(2014) suggest that irregular warfare might serve to state building. However, others
find opposite evidence in Africa (Herbst 2000) and Latin America (Cardenas 2010,
Centeno 2002).
6. A note on COW vs Wimmer-Min: To enter the Correlates of War interstate war
dataset prior to 1920, territorial units must possess diplomatic relations with both Britain
and France. A considerable large number of states that went to war during the nineteenth
century—mainly outside Europe—had not yet established sufficient relations with both of
these states (Butcher and Griffiths 2015). As a result, they are excluded from the COW
inter-state dataset. Wars against or between colonies and other non-internationally recog
nized states entities enter three auxiliary datasets in COW. But, unlike Wimmer and Min
(2009), those wars are not mapped onto current state boundaries, preventing a clear match
between past warfare and current nation-states.
Lastly, Table A-6 reports the summary statistics and sources of all variables.

Table A-5: List of Secessionist Wars, 1816-1913. This list draws from Wimmer and Min 2009 but also attributes participation to the state seeking independence, not just the colonial power.

C Cross-Sectional Distribution of Warfare and Access
to Credit
1. Table A-7 reports the breakdown of war participation while credits flows and stops
(i.e., sudden-stops). This sample is upper bounded by data availability of the outcome
variables: PIT, VAT and Tax Administration Size.
2. Figure A-2 plots the location of warfare. For exposition purposes only, all inter-state
and secessionist warfare for all countries—immediately and tentatively matched (see
Table A-4)—are considered. Darker areas indicate higher frequency of war in territory
x.
3. Figure A-3 plots the distribution of war participants regardless of war location. For
exposition purposes only, all inter-state warfare and secessionist warfare for all coun
tries—immediately and tentatively matched (see Table A-4)—are considered. Darker
areas indicate higher rates of participation.
Notice that Figures A-2 and A-3 show that most wars were fought outside Europe but
involved at least one European power.

D Estimating β1 and β2 Separately
The number of years at war having and lacking access to credit are correlated. Table A-8
fits both predictors separately to assess whether results are driven by collinearity issues. In
every model, credit access is exogenized based on sudden stops. Results replicate the main
article’s finding. War makes states when credit dries up and incentives to tax are strong,
while it does not when states have access to external lending.

(b) War while Credit Flows
Column 1 in Table A-9 reports the same information in regression format. In Column
2, I use a non-visual criterion to identify outliers: namely, Cook’s distance. Accordingly, I
drop 11 observations with unusually high distances. Column 2 also confirms that war makes
states when credit dries and incentives to resort to taxes are strong, while it does not when
states have access to external lending. Results are not driven by outliers.

F Influence of Fixed Effects
Region- and Colonial Origins fixed effects (6 and 4 categories, respectively) minimize
unobserved cross-sectional heterogeneity. However, if covariates are highly correlated within
region/colonial origins groups, adding fixed effects might induce high multicollinearity and
outliers. Based on the simplest specification of the exogenous access to credit model, I
stepwise drop fixed effect batteries. Column 1 in Table A-10 drops Colonial Origins Fixed
Effects. Column 2 drops Region Fixed Effects. And Column 3 drops both sets of fixed effects.
Results hold across specifications.

G Sub-Sample Analysis, Attrition Bias, and Federal
States
Table A-11 investigates the extent to which results hinge on particular regions, matching
decisions, or territorial configuration of the state.
Keeping Developing Nations Only. As it is argued in the Introduction, the bellicist
hypothesis receives broad support in Europe. But these countries are wealthier than average,
thus are more prone to participate in war. Columns 1 and 2 in Table 5 in the main text
show that results are robust to dropping the Great Powers and other economic powers in
the nineteenth-century. Next, Column 1 in Table A-11 applies a stricter test by dropping all
OECD foundational economies. Results, despite the sample size reduction, hold.
Attrition Bias. Most wars can be easily matched to current states (further details in
Appendix Section B). A minority cannot: These are extinct political entities the territory of
which overlap with more than one modern state. Table A-4 lists past polities that cannot
be matched with current state-borders without making various assumptions. The analyses
in the main text do not consider these polities, but Columns 2 and 3 in Table A-11 do in
order to minimize any potential attrition bias. Results hold.
Federal Structure. A federal constitutional structure might limit central government tax
yields while correlate with past warfare if non-unitary states result from a history of ethnic
civil wars. Column 4 and 5 in Table A-4 include a control for Federal Structure circa 2000.
Data on Federal Structure is drawn from Treisman (2000).

H Cluster Standard Errors
War in country i might affect the likelihood of war in a neighbor state. To account for
such error correlation, Table A-12 fits models with clustered standard errors at the regional
level. Because the number of clusters is low, I compute Wild-Bootstrap cluster standard
error. I report 95% CI. Results suggest again that war makes states when incentives to tax
are strong (i.e., during sudden-stop of credit) but it does not when countries can finance war
externally.

I The Nature, Timing, and Length of Sudden-Stops
Stock Market Crash. The 1910 crisis is a stock-market crash, not a banking panic.
Based on Figure 1, the stock-market crash might not cause comparable capital dry shocks.
Accordingly, Column 1 in Table A-13 treats the 1910 stock-market crisis as a non-crisis, and
investigates whether this has any impact on the estimates of interest. It does not.
The 1893 Crisis. Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) do not list the 1873 banking crisis for Great
Britain, despite it being a major crisis in the nineteenth century (Kindleberger and Aliber
2005). Technically, the 1873 crisis originated in Austria and Germany. But, it was only a
matter of months that the crisis reached London, causing a sudden-stop of credit (Bordo
1986), as Figure 1 reflects. Based on the relevance of this crisis, I include it in the main
analysis. For the sake of robustness, Column 2 in Table A-13 excludes the 1873 banking
crisis as a cause of sudden-stop. Results hold
Longer Spells [or Placebo Test]. Columns 3 and 4 allow for longer spells of sudden
stops. Specifically, Columns 3 and 4 replace the four-year rule of credit stop based on Catao
(2006) for five and six years spells, respectively. The effect of fighting war during these longer
periods is still positive. Longer windows can be interpreted as placebo tests. Accordingly,
results hold but turn weaker as windows expand. Results hold.

J Models Using an Endogenous Measure of Credit Ac
cess: Default Episodes
The analysis in this section identifies periods of access to international credit markets
based on default episodes, as listed in Reinhart and Rogoff (2009). These authors define
sovereign default as the failure of a government to meet a principal or interest payment on
the due date (or within the specified grace period). Among the main causes of default, there
is war, which reinforces the main insight of the theoretical discussion: financing war with
loans does not guarantee an improvement in the fiscal capacity of the state with respect to
prewar levels.
Reinhart and Rogoff (2009) code periods of external default starting as early as 1800 for
68 countries, as defined by their current territory. Next, I work with 63 out the 68 countries
in their sample, all for which full data is available.151 The sample includes countries of the
five continents and accounts for approximately 90% of world GDP by 1913. The median
duration of default episodes in the period under consideration is six years (Reinhart and
Rogoff 2009:81). Critically, while in default, countries are excluded from the international
lending market (Tomz 2007), which I expect to strengthen the ruler’s incentives to invest in
the tax capacity of the state.
The empirical specification follows the same form as Expression 1. However, instead of
using sudden-stops of credit to establish when a given country has no access to international
lending, here I use default episodes, an intuitive but endogenous variable. To establish
a benchmark, Column 1 in Table A-14 tests for the unconditional version of the bellicist
hypothesis for the 63 states sampled in (Reinhart and Rogoff 2009). Results are mixed
(consistent with what many have found): the coefficient for # of Years at War between
1816-1913 in Column 1 is positive but not significant.
Column 1 should be compared to Column 2 and remaining specifications, in which I
151The five countries excluded due to tax-data limitations are: Algeria, Angola, Central African Republic, Ghana and Taiwan.

distinguish the effect of war fought while in default, β1, from war fought while having access
to international credit markets, β2. Both point estimates are positive, but, consistent with
the political economy of war finance, only the former is significantly different from zero. A
one-standard deviation increase in the number of years at war while in default increases
income tax to GDP in 0.41 points. This is a 15% increase with respect to the PIT’s sample
mean.
On the contrary, Column 2 suggests that wars that are fought when countries have access
to international markets do not exert any persistent effect on fiscal capacity. This is consistent
with the commitment problem above indicated. Nothing guarantees that once war is over,
countries service debt within the pre-established timeframe and conditions. Some countries
honor their debt (by enhancing its fiscal capacity as to amass the required funds), others do
not.
Column 3 controls for the baseline propensity to default. To this end, I include the #
Years in Default between 1816 and 1913 of each observation. The two coefficients of interest
remain virtually identical. The remaining of Table A-14 considers potential confounders,
while making sure not to control for endogenous covariates (e.g., Current per Capita GDP
or Democracy levels).152 Models include: Being a Great Power, War Location, War Casual
ties, Ethnic Fractionalization, Contemporaneous Civil War, and WWI participation. Across
specifications, βˆ1 and βˆ2 remain the same as in Columns 2 and 3.
152For reference, Appendix Table A-22 reports models including endogenous controls. Results hold.

K Alternative War-Financing Policy
There are (at least) three other ways to finance war: domestic loans, expanding money
supply, and financial repression. I address them stepwise:
K.1 Domestic Borrowing
Domestic borrowing requires a developed financial market, something that, in the period
under consideration, was only guaranteed in a few European countries (Reinhart and Rogoff
2009: ch.7). The pool of domestic investors in the periphery tended to be small, and loans to
government represented a large share of their portfolio. This implied expensive credit relative
to other options overseas (Della Paolera and Taylor 2013, Flandreau and Flores 2012, Kuran
and Rubin 2017). Not surprisingly, countries in the periphery resorted to international
markets for financing.
Columns 1-3 in Table A-15 address the possibility of fighting wars while having access to
either domestic or external credit, or none.. The first row shows the coefficient of having no
access to the domestic or international markets (i.e., domestic and external default), while
the fourth row shows the effect of having access to either to the domestic or international
markets. In the former case, I expect the incentives to invest in fiscal institutions to be
maximum. Consistent with this expectation, the magnitude of the coefficients grows with
respect to those reported in Table A-14 (external default only). Column 2 adds a Great
Power indicator to control for differences in domestic credit markets, and Column 3 controls
for the War Location, as it could influence the capacity to mobilize resources domestically.
The point estimates of the two coefficients of interest, βˆ1 and βˆ2, remain fairly stable.
K.2 Expanding Money Supply
A second means to financing war is expanding the money supply (also known as printing
money). Except as an extreme measure of last resort, printing money occupied a “subor

dinate position” in pre-1913 war finance (Sprague 1917). The reason is that expanding the
money supply has inflationary consequences. A sudden expansion of the money supply gives
the government a temporary relief with which to pay bills and purchase additional weapons,
but this gain is rapidly dissipated by the costs of inflation (Rockoff 1998, Schumpeter 1938).
Nevertheless, it is worth checking what the effect of printing money is on long-term fiscal
capacity.
In the absence of direct data of instances of money printing, I rely on episodes of infla
tionary crises, as coded by Reinhart and Rogoff (2009). Specifically, this test assumes that
inflationary crises are related to episodes of money supply expansions. Inflation does not
dissipate soon. To account for these lags, I add four year leads to the onset of an inflationary
crisis. Based on that, I estimate the effect of being at war and in external default in the
presence and absence of an inflationary crises. I expect inflationary crises (i.e., the proxy of
money printing) to weaken the incentives to invest in fiscal capacity while being at war and
excluded from international financial markets.
The results in Columns 4-6 in Table A-15 reinforce and qualify previous findings. First,
they confirm that waging war while being in default is related to higher fiscal capacity in the
long-run regardless of money printing: both coefficients are positive. However, based on the
coefficients’ magnitude, if inflation is kept under control (i.e., the ruler does not print money),
fiscal capacity might be even higher in the long-run. This result implies that incumbents
that are not tempted to print money while being at war and in default are those investing
more decisively in the fiscal capacity of the state, holding everything else constant.
K.3 Fiscal Repression
A third way to finance war is financial repression. Calomiris and Haber (2014), Menaldo
(2016) and Reinhart (2012) show that, if anything, financial repression is a substitute of fiscal
capacity building. I lack systematic data about instances of financial repression, and cannot
test this proposition here. However, financial repression (or office selling or confiscation)
36


introduces a downward bias, if any, on the main coefficient of interest, β1. That is, if rulers
prioritize fiscal repression when they lack access to external finance, we should not expect
a positive coefficient for the # Years at War while Credit Stops, precisely because fiscal
repression is implemented as to avoid fiscal capacity building.
37


L Initial Political Conditions
L.1 Direct Measures
Expression 3 in the main paper suggests that the preference for loans over taxes is a
function of ∆c, the distance between ct and cl, the political costs of taxing and borrowing,
respectively. That comparative static suggests accounting for initial levels of power-sharing
institutions. Few countries can be characterized as democracies by 1820, but they had differ
ent levels of executive constraints. To account for these, I employ the Executive Constraint
component in the Polity IV dataset (Marshall and Jaggers 2000). To slightly broadening the
sample while not departing from initial conditions in excess, I compute Executive Constraint
averages for two periods: 1800-1830 and 1800-1850, as reported in Columns 1 to 2 in Table
A-16. To maximize degrees of freedom, I keep a minimum set of economic and geographic
controls (refer to fn. 131 in the main text).
For robustness, Column 3 fits average democratic status between 1800 and 1850 as es
tablished in Boix et al. (2013). In Column 4 I fit a country-level average of Traditional
Local Democracy for the 1800-1850 period, as coded by Giuliano and Nunn (2013) based
on the Ethnographic Atlas. In Column 5, long-run fiscal capacity is regressed on levels of
democratization, as measured by Vanhanen (2003). Across specifications, and despite the
strong reduction in the sample size, the main coefficient of interest, βˆ1 is positive and almost
always statistically significant, while βˆ2, is negative and often statistically significant.

L.2 Indirect Measures
An alternative way to address initial political conditions is to focus on geographic de
terminants of the central ruler’s authority across the territory and vis-`a-vis regional elites.
Well until the nineteenth century, the difficulties of transportation, military technology and
demographic realities placed sharp limits on the reach of even the most ambitious states
(Scott 2009:4). Central rulers’ authority was particularly challenged in mountainous terri
tory, where rebel communities were protected by natural barriers to state presence. We could
expect the central ruler’s capacity to raise taxes to finance the means of war to be under
mined by unfavorable local geographic condition. To account for this possibility, Column 1
in Table A-17 controls for Average Ruggedness, as coded in Nunn and Puga (2012).
Prior to the transportation revolution, central rulers in big states benefited from weaker
monitoring (or political constraints) by regional elites (Stasavage 2011). Large territorial
states might have exacerbated commitment problems in debt repayment and fiscal central
ization. Columns 2 and 3 in Table A-17 accounts for this possibility by controlling for Land
Area and ln(Land Area), respectively.
None of the two politically relevant geographic covariates turn to be statistically signifi
cant. Importantly, the point estimates for β1 and β2 remain unchanged after their consider
ation.

M VAT as Outcome Variable
Value-Added Tax (VAT) is arguably easier to implement than the income tax (Bird and
Gendron 2007), and it may not capture cumulated investment in fiscal capacity as precisely
as income tax ratios do. Still, Table A-18 fits models of current VAT (as % of GDP) as a
function of war and credit access in the long ninteenth century. VAT data is drawn from IMF
Government Financial Statistics. The sample size is limited by data availability. Column 1
regresses average VAT revenue between 1995 and 2005 on the benchmark regressors. We can
augment VAT data by replacing missing values for those reported in USAID Fiscal Reform
and Economic Governance Project, 2004-10, as I did with PIT data.153
Results with augmented VAT are reported in Column 2 in Table A-18.154 Columns 3
and 4 add two controls for initial state capacity, one at a time. Results hold, although β1
in column 3 is statistically significant only at 88% confidence: War fought while having no
access to external finance—when incentives to enhance taxes are expected to be strong—is
associated with long-term fiscal capacity. War waged while having access to external finance
is not.
153Recall, PIT data augmentation does not change results. Refer to Table A-1. 154Descriptive statistics for augmented VAT variable can be found in Table A-6.

N Military Alliances, British Colonies, and British Wars
This section examines the effect of (1) military alliances in the international system, (2)
the effect of being a British colony, and (3) British active participation in war. Do results
change when we account for these potential confounders?
N.1 Military Alliances
Military alliances might change the incentives to wage war and facilitate access to exter
nal credit. To account for this source of endogeneity, I control for Military Alliances that
countries may have with any of the four credit capitals in the long ninteenth century: the
British, the French, the German, and the USA. Despite having uneven weight in global fi
nances (refer to Table 1 in the main text), any of these four economies had both the capacity
to finance third countries and coordinate military interventions with them.
To code military alliances, I rely on Gibler (2009). This dataset offers dyads of military
alliances between independent countries since 1816. Some of these alliances were short-lived
while others were enduring. To account for this heterogeneity, I compute the share of years
between 1816-1913 in which a given country had any form of military alliance (defense, neu
trality, non-aggression, and entente) with each of the four credit capitals separately. For
instance, Portugal had a military alliance with Britain for the whole period. Accordingly,
for Portugal, Alliance with Britain holds the maximum value: 100%. Other countries (e.g.,
Belgium) stroke no military alliance with Britain during the long ninteenth century. Accord
ingly, the value for Belgium for this variable is zero. Results are reported in Columns 1 and
2 of Table A-19. Results hold.
N.2 Excluding British Colonies
It is argued that British colonies had access to external credit in more favorable conditions
than other colonies (Accominotti et al. 2011). Since Britain was the credit capital and the
44


military superpower of the long ninteenth century, the decision to go to war of British colonies
may be different from other countries’. The British colonial origins fixed effect might not
address this source of heterogeneity well enough. To address this issue, Columns 3 and 4 in
Table A-19 re-run Expression 4 excluding all British colonies. Results hold.
N.3 Excluding Wars Fought by Britain
Having already addressed strategic considerations with respect to British colonies, we
might wonder whether wars in which Britain was directly involved are comparable to other
wars. Kirshner (2007:206) argues that countries would be penalized in the international
markets if they fought against the financial center. Wars involving the British army might
thus be different from others in ways that affect capital access and fiscal capacity. To address
this issue, Columns 5 and 6 in Table A-19 report models excluding all wars in which the
British explicitly participated. To that end, # years at war without external finance and
# years at war with external finance are recalculated for remaining countries. Results hold
across specifications.

O Ongoing War and Periphery Countries
This Appendix is a follow-up of Columns 3 to 5 in Table 6. Specifically, Table A-20
considers ongoing wars only (i.e., wars that are initiated while the market is still lending and
eventually dries up as a result of a financial crisis) while putting the spotlight on peripheral
countries.
These models drop Great Powers, the USA, Canada, and the Netherlands. Results suggest
that after addressing (1) selection issues in war participation (i.e., ongoing wars) and (2)
endogeneity in war finance (i.e., sudden-stops), war makes states with certainty in peripheral
countries as long as war is not financed with external loans. This coincides with periods in
which incentives to tax are strongest.

P A Reduced-Form Model of War-Making
This section addresses the endogeneity of war in a reduced-form framework. In analyzing
the effect of war in Europe, Gennaioli and Voth (2015) instrument war frequency of country
i based on war participation by adjacent countries against third countries. The logic behind
this instrument is that contextual circumstances that lead neighboring countries to war might
increase the likelihood of country i going to war against a third country. The exclusion
restriction is that there is no effect of war in neighboring countries on fiscal capacity that is
not the result of the risk of war (ibid.).
War in neighboring countries is not a strong instrument outside Western Europe; the
presence of oceans separating units weakens the relationship between the instrument and the
endogenous variable. The exclusion restriction is also harder to hold in the presence of wars
of conquest of entire regions by colonial powers. For both reasons, I take a different path
here. I interpret war in a neighboring country as a threat that potentially yields an impact
on fiscal development.155 To that end, I replace inter-state war fought by country i while
credit stops (flows) for inter-state wars fought by immediately adjacent neighbors while credit
stops (flows). Notice that I can implement this test only because sudden-stops are common
to every country. Importantly, wars of i against adjacent countries are excluded to maximize
exogeneity. Expression 4 becomes:
P ITi,1995−2005 = α + β1(#years at war by i’s-adjacent neighbors between 1816-1913 | external lending stops)
+β2(#years at war by i’s-adjacent neighbors between 1816-1913 | external lending flows)
+Xiδ + γ + ρ + i
where controls and fixed effect batteries remain the same. I exclude all islands from the
analysis (Australia, Iceland, Madagascar, Philippines, and New Zealand) because they do not
have clear adjacent neighbors. I report the estimates in Table A-21 and plot the coefficients
of interest, βˆ1 and βˆ2, in Figure A-5. These hold the expected sign: that is, the reduced-form
version of waging war while having access to external credit is not associated with long-term
155I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer for this suggestion.
48


fiscal capacity, whereas the reduced-form version of waging war while having no access to
external loans is. The main difference with Table 6 in the main text is the size of the effects:
Here they attenuate because of the imperfect match between war making by country i and
that of its adjacent neighbors.

Q Including Endogenous Controls
Covariates that result from treatment are known as endogenous controls (or bad controls).
Their inclusion in empirical models biases the estimates of interest, in this case β1 and β2.
This problem is also known as post-treatment bias. Here I consider four potential bad
controls: democracy, preferences for redistribution, GDP per capita, and trade openness.
Bates and Lien (1985) claim that democratic institutions may result from tax-financed war
participation. The Transmission Section in the main paper lean support to this argument.
Scheve and Stasavage (2010) suggest that preferences for the size of government is endogenous
to war participation. Dincecco and Prado (2012) show that long-term GDP is a function
of participation in war in the past. Queralt (2015) claims that trade openness follows fiscal
capacity building, which results from war participation.
Table A-22 corroborates that the inclusion of bad controls impact the size of the coeffi
cients of interest, specially when the model includes current per Capita GDP. Still, both βˆ1
and βˆ2 hold the expected sign and achieve statistical significance within conventional levels.

R Short-Term Effects: A Duration Model
In Section 6, Short-Term Effects, I assess short-run effects using cross-sectional data. Here
I model the adoption of a modern census exploiting duration dependence. Census technology
is a requirement to develop a modern tax system capable of assessing wealth and monitoring
compliance of an atomized tax base. Hence, it is worth investigating further whether war
while lacking external finance stimulates modern census adoption. This time, however, I
exploit longitudinal variation of this variable and fit a duration model.
The structure of the data for this test is Binary Time-Series Cross-Sectional (BTSCS).
Beck, Katz, and Tucker (1998) show the equivalence between BTSCS and survival models.
Hence, the adoption of a modern census can be fitted with a standard probit model. I follow
Carter and Signorino (2010) and use a cubic polynomial approximation to the hazard. Four
observations are left-censored: the USA, the UK, Norway and Sweden, which adopted a
modern census before 1816. I exclude these cases from the analysis. The hazard rate is
computed with respect to the adoption of the first modern census by Sweden, 1751. That
is, since the implementation of the first modern census, all countries are at risk of adopting
that head counting technology. See Aidt and Jensen (2009) for a similar design.156
Some countries had not adopted a modern census by 1913. Right-censoring, however,
is not problematic. Since adoption of census technology happens only once, time-invariant
country-specific characteristics cannot be fitted. Hence, I only include time-varying economic
controls (per Capita GDP and Oil Production) plus region and colonial origins fixed effects.
In Column 2 I replace the colonial origins fixed effects for time-varying country-specific
colonial status between 1816 and 1913. The sample is limited to 50 panels because of data
availability of key controls: ln(per cap GDP) and Oil Production.
Results are reported in Table A-23. Fighting war having access to international finance
has a large negative effect, as shown in the first row. That is, having access to external finance
156If I use country-specific hazards, results are more favorable to the working hypothesis. However, the initial year of country-specific hazards is driven by data availability, not a substantive reason. That is why I use a common starting point.
53


discourages the adoption of a modern census, a requirement for high tax capacity. The effect
of waging inter-state war without access to international finance is positive, approximately
0.5 points, and statistically significant at 90%. This result confirms the opposite incentives to
adopt a modern census during war—thus the capacity to strengthen tax capacity—depending
on external finance access.

S Additional Evidence of Short-Term Effects: Railroad
Density as of 1913
The Short-Run Effects Section in the main text show evidence that war-finance has effects
on two proxies of state capacity: School Enrollment Ratios and Census Technology. This
section considers a third proxy: Rail lines length, which captures Mann’s (1984) notion of
“infrastructural power” of the state. Rail lines facilitate the state’s presence throughout the
territory. Importantly, Dincecco, Fenske and Onorato (2016) and Queralt (2015) show that
the railroad network correlates with fiscal capacity.
Next, I regress Rail Line Length By 1913 on war and exogenous credit access in the long
ninteenth century. Due to data limitations, the initial value of Railroads correspond to 1850.
To fully account for the topographical characteristics of rail line building, models include
three additional controls: land area, tropical weather, and terrain ruggedness.

T Transmission Effects in Regression Framework
Table A-25 presents Figure 3’s information in the main text in regression format. Accord
ingly, fiscal capacity is proxied by nontrade tax revenue as a percentage of tax revenue. For
each decade between 1945 and 1995, I compute the average value of the dependent variable.
Given the small N, fewer controls are considered, as explained in fn. 131 in the main text.
Some of the estimates for βˆ1 do not reach standard levels of statistical significant, but they
are reasonably close given the sample size, as shown in Figure 3 in the main text.

U Political Mechanism in Regression Format
This section shows information in Figure 4 in the main text in regression format. Table
A-26 includes two dependent variables: Average Executive Constraints in 1900-1913 and
1995-2005, respectively. Two clarifications are in order: First, I rely on Executive Constraints
instead of the standard Polity 2 score (which includes also measures of executive recruitment,
and political competition) because Executive Constraints genuinely captures the outcome of
the political negotiation around taxation: namely power-sharing institutions.157 Second, I
calculate average values to minimize the influence of abnormal cases.
Initial Executive Constraints is a key confounder in this test, as it influences access to ex
ternal credit in the past (Schultz and Weingast 2003) and it might condition future Executive
Constraints. However, very few countries hold a value for early initial constraints—29 exactly,
once I drop Great Britain from the sample: Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil,
Chile, China, Denmark, Ecuador, France, Greece, Iran, Japan, Mexico, Morocco, Nepal,
Netherlands, Norway, Paraguay, Peru, Portugal, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey,
United Kingdom, United States of America, Uruguay and Venezuela. Most of these countries
are sovereign by 1830, thus non-sovereign countries (e.g., colonies) are under-represented in
this test.158
The introduction of Initial Executive Constraints reduces the sample size dramatically.
The small N does not allow for a full battery of Region and Colonial Origins fixed effects.
To minimize unobserved heterogeneity across units, I include six controls, as explained in
fn. 131 in the main text. Results in Table A-26 suggest that going to war while credit flows
in the long ninteenth century is negatively related to executive constraints in the short- and
long-run. External credit saves the ruler the political costs of undertaking political change,
allowing the persistence of low executive constraints. By contrast, going to war while credit
stops is positively related to short- and long-run executive constraints. The coefficient for the
157See Besley and Persson 2011 for a similar approach. 158This issue is addressed in the bureaucratic mechanism section.

long-run does not reach standard levels of statistical significance by a small margin (p-value
= 0.136). However, Figure 4 in the main text, which plots this coefficient with 90% CI, does
suggest that war increases short- and long-term executive constraints as long as it is waged
in periods in which rulers have strong incentives to expand tax capacity.
Overall, results suggest that war-financing has important implications on the origins of
power-sharing institutions. Tax-financed war facilitates political reform, whereas external
debt-financed war does not. This is a novel result that will be fully developed elsewhere.

V Bureaucratic Mechanism of Persistence
Arguably, the political mechanism analyzed in the main manuscript is most compelling
among sovereign countries, in which genuine tax bargaining between the ruler and taxpayers
may naturally arise. Political conditions in colonies and occupied territories might not be
conducive to such negotiations.159 For such cases—and for every other case, that is, regard
less of political status—there is a second, nonmutually exclusive mechanism that facilitates
transmission over time, namely bureaucratic survival.
Modern tax administrations are created for and by war.160 Professionalized bureaucracies
are necessary to assess wealth and collect taxes as well as to resist the natural aversion to
having one’s sources of income monitored. However, once created, bureaucracies entrench,
grow larger, and, arguably, became states within states (Tilly, 1990, p.115).
Bureaucracies maximize institutional survival by increasing their size and financial en
dowment (Niskanen, 1994). Accordingly, we can expect tax bureaucracies to oppose dis
investment in administrative capacity, ultimately carrying on the effect of war making on
long-run fiscal capacity. Columns 7 and 8 in Table 5 in the main text, in which the size of
the tax administration circa 2005 is regressed on past warfare and credit access, lend support
to this mechanism.
To show earlier cross-national evidence, Figure A-6 plots the effect of nineteenth-century
war finance on two proxies for administrative capacity in the late 1970s: the Size of the
Finance Administration and its Wage Premium relative to other branches of government.161
Despite the small sample size (see below for details), Figure A-6 shows that nineteenth
century war waged without access to external finance is associated with bigger and well
funded finance administrations, whereas war waged with access to external finance is not.
In particular, a one standard deviation increase in the number of years at war when credit
159This opinion is contested: Br ̈autigam (2008) and Makgala (2004) show evidence of tax-based political bargain between local elites and colonial powers. 160See Brewer (1988) for Europe and Young (1994) for colonial Africa. 161Earlier crossnational data are not available.

administration in the late 1970s by 49% and 22%, respectively.162
Data Details for Bureaucratic Mechanism. Historical, cross-national data for public
administration characteristics are virtually non-existent. As far as I know, Tait and Heller
(1983) is the one exception. They code key characteristics of the public administration of
49 countries in the late 1970s. Tait and Heller’s (1983) sample includes developed economies
as well as former colonies. Their data do not include information of the Size of the Tax
Administration, specifically. Instead I work with data of the Size of the Finance and Planning
Administration (normalized to 100 inhabitants).163
The Size of the Finance Administration measures the extensive margin of the effect of
war. According to Niskanen (1994), we should also observe an effect of war on the intensive
margin of bureaucratic development. In the absence of budget data, I measure the intensive
margin by the Wage Premium of the Finance Administration Employees relative to other
branches of central government.164
The effective sample is fairly small. To minimize unobserved heterogeneity across units,
I include six controls, as explained in fn. 131 in the main text. Despite the small N, results
move in the expected direction. Three out of the four coefficients of interest hold the expected
sign and are statistically different from zero. βˆ1 in Column 1 of Table A-27 almost reaches
conventional levels of statistical significance (p-value = 0.112, N = 23). This is clearly seen
in Figure A-6 in the main text. Altogether, these results suggest that war finance has effects
on long-term bureaucratic development.
162The prediction for Size is unusually high because both this variable and the key predictor are skewed. 163With respect to the Size of the Finance Administration, the following countries can be matched to the main dataset of this article: Argentina, Belgium, Congo, Cyprus, Ecuador, El Salvador, Germany, Guatemala, Iceland, Ireland, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Panama, Senegal, South Africa, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, Sweden, United States of America, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. 164With respect to the Wage Premium of the Finance Administration, the following countries can be matched to the main dataset of this article: Argentina, Cyprus, Ecuador, El, Salvador, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, Panama, South Africa, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Swaziland, United States of America, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. All remaining countries have missing information in some key variable. At any point, both effective samples offer a good balance of developing and developed countries.

W Further Evidence of Exogeneity of Sudden-stops
Table 3 suggests that the frequency and length of war in and outside sudden-stop periods
are virtually identical (or balanced). Figure A-7 shows this differently. In particular, it plots
the Total Number of Wars per Year in the sample, and identify the onset of sudden-stops.
Financial crises that begin within four years of the last sudden-stop (the average duration)
are not plotted.
If sudden-stops are anticipated, we should observe a systematic increase in the frequency
of war right before the onset of the credit crunch. However, Figure A-7 does not show such a
pattern. Wars take place before and after sudden-stops, almost evenly, consistent with Table
3 in the main text.
