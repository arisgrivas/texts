Abstract
For most of the classical gold standard era,Italy was not formally committed to gold,instead the lira ‘‘shadowed’’ gold. The remarkable stability of the lira exchange rate raises the question of why Italy did not move to official convertibility when it could have gained gold standard benefits at a seemingly low cost. The answer to this puzzle lies in the management of the ItalyÕs large foreign debt. Although denominated in lire,holders of the debt had the privilege of converting their coupons into gold at the official exchange rate in Paris. This arrangement offered the government an opportunity to temporarily exploit domestic bondholders who found it difficult to circumvent the barriers to arbitrage. In times of fiscal problems, the government gained some seignorage while the lira was allowed a limited depreciation. Shadowing the official gold rate,lost some of the possible benefits of convertibility but gave the government fiscal flexibility. Ó 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

standard rule was repeatedly broken. Once abandoned,a considerable time passed before the old parity was resumed. Many countries experienced persistent fiscal problems and issued paper money to gain seignorage,usually in times of military conflict.1 In 1861,the Kingdom of Italy was created and the bimetallic standard was adopted for the lira. Yet,convertibility was soon suspended in 1866 when war broke out with Austria. The government proclaimed its firm commitment to resume the old parity,but 17 years went by before convertibility was resumed in 1883. A few months later,the banks of issue halted free conversion,which was never resumed. Thus,during the 52 years between Unification and World War I,Italy was legally on a bimetallic exchange rate regime for 15 years (1861–1866 and 1883–1893),but the actual period of effective lira convertibility was seven years. By signaling commitment to orthodox fiscal policies,adherence to the gold standard provided countries with certain benefits,most notably a lower premium for country risk (Bordo and Kydland,1995; Bordo and Rockoff,1996). However,Italy did not let the lire deviate far from the official parity,and the market exchange rate was remarkably stable, Ôshadowing goldÕ (see Fig. 1).2 Hence,seignorage was not systematically exploited for revenue. This behavior suggests that there might have been a modest cost for Italy to adopt the gold standard,raising the question of why Italy did not make a greater effort to resume convertibility and adhere strictly to the gold standard. The answer to this apparent paradox lies in the management of government debt. Taxation was not a flexible instrument in the newly united kingdom. Facing large budget deficits,in 1866 and in 1888–89,the Italian government rationally preferred to sell debt and smooth the tax burden over several years,limiting monetization. It is well known that much of the debt,the rendita italiana,was sold in Europe,primarily in France; but it is less well known that it was priced in gold abroad and in paper currency in Italy.3 The Italian governmentÕs attempt to segment the market and to force Italian investors to be paid in lire when the lira exchange rate weakened was successful,although its success was limited by the lira Õs depreciation being kept within narrow margins. Although the rendita appeared to be a paper debt,it was in fact a gold debt,which acted as a stabilizing device for foreign and domestic investors. Italy was able to borrow abroad cheaply not because of the liraÕs legal adherence to gold or its

Italy never resorted to competitive devaluation. The lira exchange rate proved remarkably stable against gold standard currencies. It ‘‘shadowed’’ gold closely; the lira exchange rate against the British pound is a stationary variable (Tattara and Volpe,1997,pp. 246–247). During this period,the lira exchange rate was,on the whole,much more stable than the ruble,the Austrian florin,the peseta,and the US dollar (Flandreau, 1998). 3 For example,Bordo and Rockoff (1996) miss this point. They compute the domestic yield on the Italian rendita as the ratio of coupon (in foreign currency) and the rendita price (in lire). They compare this measure with the rendita yield,measured as the ratio of the coupon and price in foreign currency,as if these were two different bonds (Table 3),instead of computing the two yields using the same currency.

convertibility (Bordo and Rockoff,1996; Eichengreen and Flandreau,1996) but because of the debtÕs foreign gold convertibility. Exchange rate flexibility was nonetheless important in promoting economic development of the young kingdom,as it enlarged the choice of the policy instruments available to the government and helped the adjustment process.
2. Italian fiscal policy
After unification,Italy had a huge public debt inherited from the constituent states. Previous debts were merged and transformed into the new kingdomÕs public debt,equal to 50% of Italian GNP (Ministero del Tesoro,1988,table 17). 4 A high nominal and real rate of interest on the debt and low GNP growth rate kept the ratio of the Italian debt to GNP high. In addition to the military costs of unification,the fight against banditry in the South and the need to build railways and other infrastructure increased the debt. Public debt to GNP doubled in 8 years,reaching 100% by the end of the 1860s. Interest on debt constituted 30 to 40% of total government expenditures (Ministero del Tesoro,1969,vol. 4,table 5). When war with Austria became imminent,the Italian Prime Minister asked the Rothschilds to assist with a new debt issue,but they refused. The Rothschilds acted as dealers in the rendita,keeping a large stock of Italian debt in their portfolios. 5 They feared that a request for additional funds on the international capital market would reduce rendita prices (De Cecco,1990,docs. 49 and 51). If revenue had to

4 Almost all the previous debts of the states were recognized: 50% of the total debt belonged to Piedmont and derived from the wars of independence fought by Piedmont and the Kingdom of Sardinia (Sachs,1885,pp. 459–463). 5 On the RothschildÕs attitude towards Italy in 1866,see Ferguson (1998,vol. 2,pp. 142–145; 168–169).

be raised for war and taxation and new debt issues were ruled out,the alternatives were printing money and selling public assets. The government tried hard to find new sources of revenue. Land and railways were privatized (Zamagni,1990,p. 225) and a compulsory low (5%) interest debt was issued in 1866.6 Under government pressure, rendita purchases by the Banca Nazionale—a commercial bank and the largest bank of issue—reached a peak in 1866 (De Mattia, 1967,vol. 1,table 2),but rendita prices sagged. At the same time,the Banca Nazionale was pressed to make huge discounts and advances to small banks suffering from a crisis in the silk markets in Genoa and Turin. In 1866,83% of all Banca Nazionale discount and advances operations were channelled to four small banks,leaving other customers empty-handed.7 When the government pressed the Banca Nazionale for a loan,the credit market experienced unprecedented stringency and convertibility was suspended,releasing banks of issue from specie convertibility. 8 The corso forzoso or inconvertibility paved the way for new requests for loans from the government.9 Although the TreasuryÕs deficits were reduced by the 1870s,some of the maturing debt was monetized because of the high cost of new rendita placements both on the domestic and on foreign markets.10 The bank had become a flexible source of low-cost credit for the government,and it was rewarded with unique privileges in its charter that gained it rents.11 Half the current budget deficits for the eight years 1866–1873 were monetized,and the money provided to the Treasury equalled three-quarters of the increase in circulation. During suspension,currency in circulation was limited to three times silver and gold reserves; and in 1868,a ceiling on total issue was set. 12 The Italian government made strenuous efforts to balance the budget. In 1872,the deficit was almost eliminated thanks to rising tax revenues; and the deficit remained small until 1874. The year 1875 saw the first—albeit slight—surplus. Total revenues
6 One percent interest was added,as a lottery premium,and the debt maturity was 13 years. In 18661868,the average yield on the rendita in Paris was 10%. 7 The banks were the Credito Mobiliare di Torino e Firenze,Banco di Sconto e Sete di Torino,Cassa Generale di Genova and Cassa di Sconto di Genova (Di Nardi,1953,pp. 122–125). 8 It is questionable whether the abandonment of convertibility in 1866 was an inevitable consequence of war expenditures or whether it was the first lender-of-last-resort operation undertaken by the government in favor of the banking system. The Parliamentary Commission on Inconvertible Currency claimed that suspension was the result of banking not fiscal problems (Di Nardi,1953,pp. 121–138). 9 Almost exactly the same path had been followed in the financing the 1848 War of Independence. The international market dried up,the Treasury deficit was monetized and the lira depreciated (Conte,1990). 10 Between 1867 and 1873,811 million lire worth of debt came to maturity and was not renewed (Ministero del Tesoro,1969,vol. 4,table 5). This development was reflected in the advances from the Banca Nazionale from April 1,1866 to June 30,1874 totaling 790 million lire (Di Nardi,1953,p. 139). 11 Loans to the Treasury had a service cost that was,on average,less than one-third the price of interest-bearing debt. Banks of issue balance sheets show their net income,until the late 1870s,was increasingly due to operations with the Treasury (De Mattia,1977,table 102). The close link between Banca Nazionale and the Treasury raised a lengthy debate in Parliament that resulted in the 1874 monetary reform,where all the banks of issue were put on an equal footing. 12 The Banca Nazionale was allowed to count loans to the Treasury as reserves; other banks of issue could include their credits to the Banca Nazionale as reserves. The ratio of specie to currency for the Banca Nazionale fell from 50% in 1865 to 11%,while hovering around 50% for other banks of issue. The Banca Nazionale issued 43% of total currency in 1865,and 79% in 1873 (De Mattia,1967,vol. 1,table 2).

were 7% of GNP,rising to 12% in 1873 and 13% in 1880 (Brosio and Marchese,1986, table 8A). While land taxes declined,income taxes rose from 0 to 15% of tax revenues (Ministero del Tesoro,1969,vol. 3,tables 12 and 13). The deficit rose again in 18851891. Expenditures increased for railways,while revenues declined. Debt grew almost continuously until 1897 when it reached 120% of Italian GNP (Ministero del Tesoro, 1988,table 17). In Europe,Italy Õs per capita debt was the third highest after France and Portugal (FennÕs Compendium,1889). In the early 1890s,the budget deficit again declined,as expenditures fell and revenues increased with a new surge in economic growth. Money creation for the Treasury was now insignificant,and the real interest burden of the Italian debt fell. Rapid growth and the budget surplus from 1897 to the First World War drove the debt/GNP ratio downwards.13
3. The rendita italiana
Public debt to GNP remained at a high level throughout the period,and management of the debt was the main task facing the Italian government. In the early 1860s, three-quarters of the Italian public debt consisted of perpetual bonds,the rendita italiana. The remaining quarter was in short-term bonds (Sachs,1885,p. 486). Interest on the rendita was high,reaching 12% in June 1866; and interest expenditures accounted for 40% of the budget (Ministero del Tesoro,1969,vol. 4,table 5). The rendita was a certificate of indebtedness in lire issued by the Italian government. Although there was a rendita 3 1/2%,the predominant security was the rendita 5% (bearing a 5% coupon). It was sold both as a bearer bond and a registered bond. Most of the registered rendita were held domestically by institutional investors,including insurance companies and non-profit organisations (Felloni,1964,p. 153). Typically,bearer rendita were sold abroad.14 In 1877,a mixed rendita was created,

G T is the budget primary balance,computed by deducting interest on the public debt from the current balance (Ercolani,1969,pp. 432–433; Ministero del Tesoro,1988). Bt=Yt is from Zamagni (1998).

14 See the Compagnie des agents de change (1882,p. 127). Some registered rendita coupons were paid abroad following a special deal with the Rothschilds in 1884. Affidavits of residency prevented payment abroad of registered rendita coupons belonging to Italian citizens. However,there is evidence of some limited payments abroad for registered rendita,which appear to have been less than 1.5% of the rendita debt (Ministero del Tesoro,1896,p. 120). When the exchange rate depreciated,demands for conversion from of registered to bearer rendita increased (Ministero del Tesoro,1896,pp. 102–105).

where the bond was registered but the coupon was payable to the bearer. Coupons on the bearer and the mixed rendita could be cashed abroad,either by Italians or foreigners. They were paid in lire but when currency convertibility was suspended in 1866,the payment of interest on these bonds was promised at the original parity. The governmentÕs commitment was credible enough that interest on the rendita abroad was referred to as interest ‘‘in foreign currency’’ or ‘‘in gold.’’15 The rendita was traded in foreign markets,principally Paris,Berlin,Vienna,and London. More than half of the rendita were initially sold in Paris by the Rothschilds.16 In the mobile international capital market,the rendita competed with British consols, French rentes,and other government bonds; and investors could shift towards foreign competing assets. A large fraction of the rendita held abroad was,in fact,owned by Italians (De Cecco,1990,p. 25,n. 30). Italian and foreign rendita owners who collected their coupons abroad were paid in foreign currency at the official parity.17 Of course, a savvy Italian investor would collect his coupon abroad whenever the exchange rate weakened,and convert the foreign currency obtained at the official parity into lire at the current rate of exchange. However,not all rendita owners arbitraged the coupon payment. Many unsophisticated,often low denomination,investors would cash their coupon domestically,in spite of the arbitrage opportunities. As seen in Table 1,arbitrage made the rendita price in French francs in Paris (henceforth,the Paris price) equal to the rendita price in lire in Italy (henceforth,the Milan price) adjusted for the lire-franc spot exchange,except for trading and information costs.18 For a rendita certificate with a face value of 100 lire,priced in French francs in Paris at 74.75 (February 14,1879),and a depreciation of the lira from parity (1 lira 1⁄4 1 franc) of 10.8%,the price in Milan would be 82.82 lire or the Paris price multiplied by the exchange rate (74:75 1:108). The lire per franc equilibrium condition is reflected in the rendita yields. Freedom of capital movement ensured a Milanese owner of the rendita could go to Paris,buy a rendita there and cash the 5 lire coupon at parity as 5 francs for the rest of his life,earning a yield of 6.69% at the current price of 74.75. He could get the same coupon and yield from a rendita certificate bought in Milan and subsequently taken to Paris. In a segmented market,Italian investors who did not exploit this arbitrage opportunity would cash the coupon of 5 lire in the domestic market and would receive a yield of 6.04% on the price of 82.82 lire.19 Generally,let et be the spot rate of exchange defined as lira per unit of foreign exchange and PMt and PPt be the price of the bond respectively in Milan (lire) and Paris (francs). The arbitrage condition is:
15 Interest payments,if collected abroad,were paid in foreign currency at the rate of exchange published twice a year in the Gazzetta Ufficiale. See Sachs (1885,p. 194) and Piccinelli (1897,p. 17). 16 See Sachs (1885,ch. VII). On the role of Paris in funding European government debts,see Fishlow (1985). Till the late 1880s Paris was the only center where Rendita coupons were paid abroad. In the 1890s half of the Rendita coupons paid abroad went through Berlin (Ministero del Tesoro,1896,p. 127). 17 Interest at home and abroad received the same tax treatment (Felloni,1964,p. 167). 18 Genoa had initially the most important stock exchange in Italy,but it was soon supplanted by Milan. 19 Fratianni and Spinelli (2001,p. 154,footnote 40) and Avesani and Spinelli (1995,p. 128,footnote 9) compare the rendita prices in Florence and in Paris,implicitly assuming that the two are expressed in the same currency.

Similarly when there is arbitrage,the rendita yield is the ratio of the couponÕs face value c (in lire or in francs at 1:1) and the price of the bond,where the bond has infinite duration,or iPt is the Paris rendita yield and iMt is the Milan rendita yield:

There were,of course,information and transfer costs that created a non-transaction band around the arbitrage parity. Rendita transfer abroad was performed through foreign intermediaries. The commission paid to buy or sell the rendita on the Paris stock exchange was 0.10–0.125% (Crampon,1863,p. 21; Haupt,1894,p. 569). A stamp tax was added at 0.12% for bearer rendita and 0.15–0.30% for registered rendita (Deloison,1890,pp. 732,781,786–787). Commissions varied according to the number of transactions in a year and the size of the order. In addition,there was the telegraph cost20 and the cost of collecting the relevant information.21 Transfer and related costs declined with the size of the trade. All factors taken into account,the estimated overall transfer costs were in the range of 0.40–0.50%. Let a represent transfer and information costs paid by an investor.

20 For the basic telegraph prices,see Istat (1958,table 105) and the following footnote 27. 21 Rendita abroad might entail a limited risk due to fear of discrimination. But the foreign market was so important to the placement of the Italian debt that discriminating action against foreigners by the Italian government was very unlikely. 22 The computation of the rendita prices are explained in Appendix A.

series,expressed as deviations from parity. Milan prices were invariably higher than Paris prices,whenever the lira depreciated with respect to gold. At times,the Milan price reached the Paris price without overtaking it,as the lira was left free to float downward but was pegged upward so that the Paris price could exceed the Milan price by only a small amount for a brief period of time. Looking at the weekly rendita prices in Italy and Paris and at the weekly exchange rates published by Pantaleoni (1895,enclosure E),Fratianni and Spinelli note ‘‘the appearance of a significant arbitrage differential between domestic and international prices of Rendita Italiana’’ (1997,p. 94; 2001,p. 191). In the second half of 1893,the lira started to depreciate,and beginning in July the ratio of the Milan and Paris prices remained above the lira–franc exchange rate. According to Fratianni and Spinelli,this arbitrage opportunity occurred because of the liraÕs quick depreciation.23 There was no reason whatsoever for the zero arbitrage condition not to continue with a depreciating currency,as Romanelli,the Secretary to the Trade and Industry Board,told the Prime Minister in March 1875.24 The increase in the Milan/Paris rendita ratio was very limited and lay within the non-transaction cost band (see Fig. 3).25

23 The concomitant introduction of limitations to coupon collection abroad by Italians (the affidavit) might have raised an element of uncertainty relating to the freedom of capital movement,but this would only marginally have affected spot arbitrage. Weekly data point to a limited increase of the arbitrage margin during the 1893 Italian banking crisis but not to a systematic deviation. 24 Alessandro Romanelli was the secretary of the Consiglio del commercio e dellÕ industria (De Cecco, 1990,doc. 123,p. 628). 25 In contrast,Pantaleoni argued that in the case of depreciation,although rendita owners abroad felt safe because of the interest in gold. The existence of the gold clause itself would have burdened the state budget and raised fears of Italian government default among foreign investors. (Pantaleoni,1895,p. 377).

A band size of 1%,i.e., 0:50%,includes 90% of the observations in the period 1875–1911 and 84% of all the observations from 1865. No substantial deviations and breaks emerge in the rendita arbitrage relation. After 1875,spikes are limited to a couple of observations and appear during a few periods of policy changes and market turbulence. Arbitrage residuals are affected by the poor quality of our data. First,our data are daily averages of daily maxima and minima,and although spot transactions by small investors were often performed at the ‘‘average’’ price26 proper ask and bid prices would be needed. Moreover,the gap between the extremes varied over time. Secondly,large residuals in Fig. 3 for the first decade are possibly the result of exogenous shocks. Two wars were fought: the war between Italy and Austria–Hungary in 1866 and the war between Prussia and France in 1871. A long brokers strike began in June 1874,and no official prices were reported; rendita prices in Italy were ‘‘imputed’’ prices from brokersÕ illegal transactions outside of the market (Da Pozzo,1964,p. 36). Thirdly,although Paris rendita prices were received daily on the Italian Stock Exchange starting in 1871,customers could not instantaneously execute trades,increasingly inter-day volatility. Transfers were probably slower for relatively smaller purchases and some business was shifted from Thursday to the following Monday (for example,public holidays during which the stock market in one country was closed). Inadequate communications meant that national exchanges could operate without knowledge of foreign exchanges during the working day and make adjustments at the beginning of the next trading session,when information regarding conditions elsewhere had been received. For example,in 1853,the members of the Genoa Stock Exchange were making deals based on Paris prices that were 3 days old. The gap was reduced to 2 days old in 1860,and 1 day in March 1864

26 According to contemporaries ‘‘the average price’’ was often preferred in order to avoid purchases being made at the highest price and sales at the lowest (Crampon,1863,pp. 27–28).

(Da Pozzo,1964,p. 11). The Paris rendita was received daily in Turin from 1871; and from the Turin Stock Exchange it was delivered the same day to the Alessandria,Milan,Venice,and Genoa Stock Exchanges. A delay,of any length,caused considerable problems in settling trades that an Italian buyer or seller expected to complete by selling or buying abroad,if prices had changed substantially from those current in Paris at the time the sale or purchase was agreed. It was possible to minimize the risk by purchasing a put or a call option in Paris. Through such options the purchaser obtained the right to buy or sell a security for a fixed price at a certain date in the future. This allowed the Paris price to be fixed and provided sufficient time to allow conditions in other markets to be investigated,with the hope of a profit resulting from any differentials that were found to exist.27
4. Throwing sand in the wheels of international finance: segmenting the rendita markets
Although constrained by its dependence on the international capital market,the temptation for the Italian government to increase seignorage through inflation and depreciation on its public debt was high. Unlike many countries in the 20th century that have abused these options,Italy used depreciation on a more limited and effective basis. Each time the lira depreciated,the government collected seignorage on debt by exploiting some domestic rendita holders. Insurance companies,trade companies,and banks engaged in government business were subject to government regulation and kept part of their investments in registered rendita,as a guarantee (Nina, 1911–1915,p. 1210) They were unwilling to endanger their relationship with the government in order to profit from a small discount on the lira. In effect,the government imposed a tax on Italian institutional investors. The divergence between the Milan-via-Paris interest in lire net of transfer costs and the Milan domestic interest is a measure of the cost of the institutional rigidities that separated the foreign and unrestricted,sophisticated Italian investors from registered mostly domestic rendita holders. Arbitrage on coupon collection in the domestic and in the foreign market must take into account the cost of collecting abroad, a0. Commission on coupons paid in Paris varied widely between 0.5% to just 3 weeksÕ loss of interest,i.e.,0.150.18% (Crampon,1863,p. 21; Haupt,1894,p. 569). To make arbitrage profitable, Milan interest had to be less than the interest collected in Paris net of all costs

Italian investors facing depreciation were induced to look for safer investments abroad,but rendita coupon transfer guaranteed the real value of their domestic investment at a very limited cost. Coupon transfer was a burden,but it was easier than a capital transfer as it did not require any knowledge of the international market. When the lira depreciated,the Treasury was faced with a higher real value of payments in gold to service its debt. Politicians noticed,and the large-scale collection of coupons in Paris by Italians inflamed debate in the parliament (De Cecco,1990,doc. 45,p. 123; Ministero del Tesoro,1896,pp. 104–105). Rendita cashed abroad varied between 20 and 85% of the total bearer Rendita value as seen in Fig. 4. Investors moved quickly between the two markets; and a limited devaluation of 3% in 1882–1883 was sufficient to double the amount collected abroad suggesting a very elastic response (Ministero del Tesoro,1896,p. 120). To the dismay of the Treasury, depreciation induced people to move from registered rendita to bearer rendita,which was much more difficult to subject to fiscal controls. Registered rendita were highly desirable initially because only registered rendita were acceptable,in addition to gold and silver,as reserves to back currency for the banks of issue during inconvertibility of the lira. In 1881 when lira convertibility resumed,the share of registered rendita rapidly declined. Bearer rendita increased steadily when the lira depreciated until the introduction of the affidavit in 1893. To segment the Italian and the non-Italian rendita market,collection of interest abroad in gold was denied to Italians in January 1873 by the introduction of the affidavit that was required for presentation abroad of the first half yearÕs coupon in 1874. The affidavit was a sworn declaration (or a solemn promise for a non-religious person) that the rendita in question did not belong to an Italian citizen. The coupon presented to the bank was to be accompanied by the principalÕs certificate,making interest collection abroad expensive and risky. To make presentation of coupons in Italy more attractive,several incentives were provided that added modestly to

the interest cost. Interest was paid on the domestic market in up to 60 days in advance of maturity,and the interest claim could also be used to pay taxes (custom duties and other fiscal charges) up to 5 months in advance of maturity (Piccinelli,1897, pp. 17–19). This first affidavit requirement was weakly enforced. The affidavit was further weakened in 1879 and abolished in 1881. A French commentator,Georges Deloison,wrote that ‘‘Italy required the affidavit,but never requested registry dues and did not require that the bearer come in person to sign the affidavit’’ (1890,p. 291). It was re-introduced in 1893 for the second half yearÕs coupon; this time it was imposed with greater rigor,remaining in force until 1904. The affidavit was the means whereby the Italian government segmented the Italian debt market and thereby gained some seignorage. When affidavit came into force,the rendita market was divided according to nationality and not according to where the coupon was collected. Italians were paid in lire both at home and abroad. The affadavit and fear of further discrimination against nationals who held their rendita abroad drastically reduced the number of Italians cashing their coupons in Paris,yet the affidavit was not completely effective. Using repurchase agreements, it was legally dodged by the more astute Italian investors who transferred their bonds to French nationals just before the coupon came to maturity and bought them back again at the next settlement date (Stringher,1884). Repurchase contracts were available in Paris for rendita transactions exceeding 2500 francs and were settled on the first and the fifteenth of each month (Lefevre,1870,pp. 215–217). A time component,as well as a risk component,was part of what had been a spot arbitrage. In late 1893,the lira Õs depreciation had reached 13%,and repos were cheap although the cost varied widely. Interest from the Paris and domestic markets,with a repurchase agreement in late 1894 for the 5% rendita were:28

ian investors who kept their capital abroad,after the strict enforcement of the affadavit. In the early 1880s,before strict enforcement,the margin required to induce Italians to cash abroad was smaller. The working of the affidavit with a repurchase agreement can be easily formalized. To induce an Italian investor to collect in Paris using a repurchase agreement, domestic interest must be inferior to Paris interest net of all cost.

Here, it is the interest on money advances between settlements dates,which is assumed equal to the interest on advance payments in Italy. Brokerage fees and the repurchase cost are larger than collection charges,and the lower boundary to the interest difference is larger,in absolute terms,than before. 30 When the second affidavit went into force in late 1893,the 5% rendita coupons paid abroad declined from 85% of all bearer rendita to 35% 6 months later,as seen in Fig. 4 (Ministero del Tesoro,1906,p. 120). 31 Various factors strengthened the effect of the affidavit. As the Italian budget worsened,French owners sold a large portion of their rendita holdings. ItalyÕs country risk,measured by the difference between the French rente and the rendita yield in France widenend from July 1893. In spring 1893,a new tax was imposed on the French securities, 32 and there was a rumour of a similar measure on foreign securities (Felloni,1964,p. 206). The subsequent recovery of rendita prices paralleled the appreciation of the exchange rate,making it less profitable for Italians to cash their coupons abroad. 33 The saving on the debt service for the Treasury attributable to the decline of the coupons paid abroad (affidavit and other concurrent circumstances) was around 6% of the rendita net interest payment on January 1,1894. 34 The affidavit was not an impermeable barrier. It raised the threshold at which it was profitable to collect interest abroad; and a much larger depreciation was needed to induce arbitrage. Whereas,10 years earlier a depreciation of 2–3% would have induced arbitrage,now a collapse of 15% was believed to be necessary to produce the same effect.

31 The decline of the value of coupons cashed abroad was matched by a corresponding increase in the amount of the coupons for which advance collection was claimed domestically (Ministero del Tesoro, 1896,pp. 122–123,127–128; Ministero del Tesoro,1906,p. 120). 32 Art. 28 of the law April 28,1893.

The fluctuation of the number of coupons paid abroad had nothing to do with capital flows in and out of Italy,as is frequently alleged. 35
5. A test of capital markets integration
Rendita market integration between Italy and its most important partner,France, is tested in terms of equilibrium prices. Given the Rendita prices in Paris and Milan, the lira/franc exchange rates,transfer costs and incentives,the zero arbitrage condition in (1) is written as
PMt PPtet 1⁄4 dt; ð10Þ
where dt represents the deviations from the arbitrage condition in period t. One test of the zero arbitrage condition is to determine whether dt is stationary and whether it remains within the non-transaction cost band. If deviations are permanent in nature (i.e.,non-stationary) integration should be rejected. A visual inspection of the data provides evidence of stationarity both during the fixed and flexible exchange rate periods (Fig. 3). The arbitrage residuals are heteroscedastic; a higher deviation is characteristic of the first decade,when the market was less perfect. The standard deviation is 0.9 for the whole 45 years,declining to 0.3 from 1875. Formal tests for the presence of a unit root in the deviations, dt,are reported in Appendix A and provide clear evidence of rejection of the null hypothesis of non-stationarity (see the first table in Appendix A).36 Cointegration offers an alternative,more informative method,to check the hypothesis of market integration. If the zero arbitrage condition holds,the sequence formed by the product PPtet should be cointegrated with the PMt sequence. Call the constructed lira value of the rendita price in Paris in francs PPt; that is, PPtet 1⁄4 PPt. The arbitrage condition asserts that there exists a linear combination of the form PMt 1⁄4 a0 þ a1PPt þ ut such that the error process ut is stationary,or I(0),and the cointegrating vector between the two series, PPt and PPt,is such that a0 is insignificantly different from zero and a1 insignificantly different from unity. Pretesting the data indicates that the rendita domestic price and the rendita foreign price in lire both contain a single unit root,I(1) (see the first table in Appendix A). The next step is to consider whether there exists a cointegrating vector between PMt and PPt. Test statistics for determining the number of cointegrating vectors have been performed. The
35 For most of the period,interest collection abroad required the presentation of the accompanying principal; as a consequence,the capitals followed the coupon movement,creating an anomaly where the principle ‘‘shadowed’’ the coupon for just the time necessary to collect the coupon abroad. The principle could be left abroad to save recurrent transfer costs. Zamagni (1999,p. 339) writes that the coupons paid abroad ‘‘is useful as it provides an idea of the amount of the Italian debt placed abroad.’’ This might be true in a period of exchange convertibility,but not in other periods. 36 The distribution theory supporting the Dickey–Fuller tests assumes that the errors are statistically independent and have a constant variance. Both assumptions are rejected by our series. The Phillips and Perron test allows the disturbances to be weakly dependent and heteroscedastic as well (Phillips and Perron,1988).

values of kmax and ktrace are reported in the Appendix A (see the second table in Appendix A). They point to the rejection of the null hypothesis of no cointegration and to the acceptance the hypothesis of 1 cointegrating vector. A cointegration regression for the two prices in lire, PMt and PPt,was performed using the Johansen procedure (Johansen,1988) and the Phillips Hansen Fully Modified estimator (Phillips and Hansen,1990),which uses a non-parametric correction for simultaneous equation bias and residual autorelation/heteroscedasticity: the arbitrage relation is much less precise in the first 10 years of the estimation period,as the residuals are expected to be heteroscedastic (see third and fourth tables in Appendix A). The cointegrating relationships between the two rendita prices are:
Johansen : PMt 1⁄4 0:1751 1:0025PPt ð11Þ
ð0:1379Þ ð0:0015Þ
Phillips–Hansen : PMt 1⁄4 0:1487 1:0022PPt ð12Þ
ð0:0994Þ ð0:0011Þ
The Phillips and Hansen and Johansen residuals of the cointegration relation been tested and found to be stationary (see the first table in Appendix A). The Johansen procedure allows us to test restrictions on the cointegrating vector. Restricting a1 1⁄4 1 yields a v2ð1Þ value of 2.79 which is below the 95% critical value of the v2 distribution with one degree of freedom. We therefore do not reject the hypothesis that a1 1⁄4 1. The restricted cointegration vector is:
PMt 1⁄4 0:5158 PPt ð13Þ
ð0:0239Þ
The joint restrictions a0 1⁄4 0 and a1 1⁄4 1 yield a v2ð2Þ value of 7.3513 and the hypothesis a0 1⁄4 0 and a1 1⁄4 1 is not rejected at a lower significance level,92.5% (see the third table in Appendix A). The acceptance of the restriction a1 1⁄4 1 provides empirical evidence on the strength the arbitrage relationship. The cointegration relationship has been studied over time and tested for parameter instability in relation to the introduction of affidavit in 1893 (second half). As Lucas (1976) argued,estimated econometric parameters are unlikely to be stable when policy regimes change. The 1893 affidavit, enforced with renewed vigour,marks a clear shift in policy. 37 The cointegrating vector has been estimated for two sub-periods,with the break in early 1893,shifting the starting date week by week. The rolling coefficients of PPt and the standard errors are shown in Fig. 5. The restriction of a1 1⁄4 1 has been tested over several intervals and is generally accepted (see the fourth table in Appendix A).38 This provides empirical evidence on the ineffectiveness of the affidavit in breaking the arbitrage connection between the domestic and the foreign rendita
37 Stringher (1884). 38 The arbitrage relationship seems to improve as the sample period rolls towards the end of the century and includes the years during which affidavit was in force.

market. The absence of a cointegration relation between the Milan rendita price and the Paris rendita price in francs (see the fifth table in Appendix A) points to the effect of the lira depreciation and of the affidavit on the rendita market segmentation. The domestic segmented market and the international market did not share a common trend through time,providing evidence that seignorage was important as long as the Italian government was able to limit the categories of persons that were entitled to transfer their rendita abroad or to collect their rendita coupon abroad.
6. Conclusion
The choice of the lira exchange rate regime was not dictated only by the governmentÕs desire to manage its debt but also the need to keep the banks of issue—which were also commercial banks—solvent and stimulate the economy. During suspension,the government collected seignorage both on short-term advances from the Banca Nazionale and on its public debt,which was serviced on the domestic market.39 Seigniorage on rendita was limited,as the Italian debt was basically a gold debt. Rendita gold coupons were created in order to protect Italian and foreign investors against possible lira depreciation during risky periods. This protection was the result of a strong alliance between Italian politicians and financiers who operated directly on the French capital market. There was a unified market for bearer and mixed rendita holders uniting Rome,Milan,Genoa,Paris,Berlin,London,and Vienna. Registered rendita and small rendita holders were limited to the domestic market. Each time the lira depreciated,coupons

cashed domestically had a lower interest rate. Smart holders cashed abroad and registered holders and less sophisticated investors suffered a loss. The government attempted to exploit the rendita market segmentation by allowing the lira to depreciate,while insisting that domestic holders accept lira. But the international capital market was a sophisticated market,and Paris offered Italian investors a large selection of foreign bonds and various forms of deferred agreements on the rendita that constrained the Italian government from taking full advantage of the liraÕs depreciation. Had the lira lost more than 10–12% of its value,notwithstanding the affidavit, rendita holders would have flocked abroad,Italian public debt would have become a gold debt,and the Treasury would have suffered a substantial loss of gold. 40 Hence, while the Italian government had an opportunity to gain seignorage,the need to keep depreciation within a limited range ensured that the lira would ‘‘shadow’’ gold.
Appendix A. Data sources
Prices are for the rendita italiana and lira exchange rates are weekly. Rendita italiana 5% in Italy. Friday published prices refer to Thursday stock exchange prices,registered each Friday in Il Sole from 1865 to 1911. Prices are ‘‘fine corrente’’ and ‘‘fine mese prossimo,’’ which is the last Friday of each month. The latter was the price at which the bulk of Rendita transactions took place both in Italy and in France,where foreign government bonds were mainly exchanged on the Coulisse or curb market. See L’economista,(1893,22.1,p. 55). Generally prices are reported in Milan,and occasionally in Turin,Genoa,and Florence. The prices are the daily maximum and minimum values and the midpoint is used here. Missing values are replaced by the next dayÕs prices. After 8 May 1908 the coupon was converted at 3.75%. Rendita Italiana 5% in France. Thursday prices were reported each Friday. They are almost always for Paris,with a few from Lyons or Marseilles. Il Sole from 1865 to 1911.

A consistent series requires that all observations pertain to bills of a given maturity t. If t 1⁄4 0,the series should refer to sight bills. Because the lira purchaser of a time bill obtains his franc funds later than the purchaser of an equivalent sight bill,the interest component of the time bill reduces the exchange rate. To factor out the interest component of a t-day time bill,an interest rate is needed. The appropriate rate of interest is reported alongside the exchange price. When the lira was convertible up to 1866,the lira price 30 day sight bill was discounted at the official rate of discount to obtain the sight price. After 1866,the exchange rate already contains a forward

In fact,the ability of the Italian government to profit from seigniorage was rather limited.
