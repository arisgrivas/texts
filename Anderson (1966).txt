THE EASTERN QUESTION
For generations the great powers of Europe and their leaders struggled with the problems created by the weakness and slow disintegration of the Ottoman Empire. This gradual decline led to rivalries among the states of Europe, complicated by such strategic and economic factors as the building of the Suez Canal and the Baghdad Railway scheme, and intensified by the growing nationalism of small groups of Balkan peoples and the development of Panslavism in Russia. M. S. Anderson has succeeded _ in clarifying the intricate course of the century and a half over which this problem became one of the greatest issues, or series of issues, in European international relations. This is the first book of comparable scope and purpose to be published in English since J. A. R. Marriott's The Eastern Question: An Historical Study in European Diplomacy in 1917. The author has based his account on a wide range of materials, including publications in Russian and Western European languages, thus making available valuable information that might otherwise be inaccessible to the student.

Preface
Tuts book is not a work of research. It does not claim to be original either in the information or the ideas it provides. It attempts merely to be useful and accurate. It is intended primarily for university students and to some extent also for sixth-form use in schools; the justification for its existence is that its subject continues to bulk large in much teaching of modern history at both school and university level and that since the publication in 1917 of Sir J. A. R. Marriott’s The Eastern Question: an Historical Study in European Diplomacy no book on it has been written in English at moderate length. Since the appearance of Marriott’s book an immense amount of detailed work, much of it of high quality, has been done on different aspects of the subject. My object has been to make that work the foundation for an up-to-date, though I am afraid also pedestrian, account of a very complex series of events. I have throughout preferred the older term Near East when referring to the Balkans, the Ottoman Empire and even the Caucasus, to that of Middle East, which became current in Britain during the First World War and now appears to be dropping out of favour to some extent. I have also tried to give Turkish and Arabic names in familiar rather than more academically correct transliterations and thus to avoid the use of diacritic marks. Footnotes have been provided wherever they seemed necessary or especially useful; but an effort has been made to prevent their becoming too numerous. It is a great pleasure to acknowledge the help I have received from two of my colleagues at the London School of Economics, Dr. Kenneth Bourne and Professor W. N. Medlicott, both of whom have read the book in typescript and made valuable suggestions for its improvement.

Introduction
On 21 July 1774, at the village of Kutchuk-Kainardji in Bulgaria, Russian and Turkish representatives signed one of the most famous and important treaties in the history of European diplomacy. By it the Ottoman Empire ceded to Russia the Kuban and Terek areas in the Black Sea steppe which had hitherto, as parts of the vassal Khanate of the Crimea, been under Turkish suzerainty. She also surrendered the port of Azov at the mouth of the Don, together with the fortresses of Kerch and Yenikalé which controlled the straits joining the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea proper. More important, Russia acquired a relatively small area between the lower courses of the rivers Bug and Dnieper, together with the mouth of the latter. She thus gained for the first time a foothold, though as yet a limited one, on the Black Sea. These territorial gains, however, were only a part, and not the most important one, of what Russia achieved by the treaty. She was to have freedom of navigation for her ships on the Black Sea, which had been closed to all non-Turkish vessels since the end of the sixteenth century, and was to be able to send her merchant ships (provided they were of normal size and type) freely through the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles. She was granted the right to build an Orthodox church in Constantinople and, in a vague and potentially dangerous phrase, to make representations on behalf of it ‘and those who serve it’. The Turkish government was, under a secret article of the treaty, to pay a war indemnity of four and a half million roubles. Most important ofall, the Khanate ofthe Crimea, which was overwhelmingly Moslem in population and had been a Turkish vassal for over three centuries, was to become an independent state. (The Sultan was to retain the right of investing its Khans with their office, but this was to be a ceremony with purely religious implications, conveying no suggestion of political control.) For the Turks these were humiliating and disastrous conditions. The provision for Russian territorial gains, and even for a war indemnity and the new Church at Constantinople, might be stomached. That providing for Russian merchantmen to navigate freely on the Black Sea and in the Straits had more serious implications. It was a blow to Turkish prestige; it was certain to provoke
demands for similar concessions from the commercial states of
western Europe; it might lead to the growth of a large Russian

1768-75 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 merchant fleet in the Black Sea and hence, by providing a supply of experienced seamen, make it easier for a powerful Russian naval squadron to develop there. Above all, the independence of the Crimea seemed quite intolerable. The Crim Tatars did not want independence and, exposed as they must now be to Russian pressure and intrigues, would probably be unable to maintain it. The new allegedly independent state would thus fall under Russian control if it were not annexed outright to Russia. Apart from the humiliation of seeing many Moslems subjected to Christian rule, this would enormously strengthen Russia’s position on the Black Sea and increase the threat she now offered to the heart of the Ottoman Empire. Yet the Porte! was forced to accept these terms, and eventually and with reluctance to ratify them, because of the complete defeat suffered by the Turks in the war with Russia which they had rashly undertaken in October 1768. The first years of that struggle were for the Porte an unbroken series of disasters. In 1769-70 most of the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia were overrun by Russian armies. Simultaneously three squadrons of Russian warships were sent from the Baltic naval base of Kronstadt through the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay to the Levant. There, in July 1770, they annihilated the Turkish fleet at Chesmé, the most spectacular victory of the war though one which was not followed up and had little result. In 1771 Russian forces conquered the Crimea with ominous ease. It is true that, for various reasons, they then achieved little till the victorious advance across the Danube which ended the war in the summer of 1774. But throughout it the military and naval inferiority of the Turks had been marked. : So complete were the defeats suffered by the Porte that it had seemed at times that Russia might impose even more severe terms than those which she dictated in 1774. In the fruitless peace negotiations which dragged on intermittently between August 1772 and March 1773 at Bucharest and then at Focshani, a small town in Moldavia, Catherine II had at various times demanded the cession of an island in the Aegean which she might use as a naval base. Until March 1774, she had insisted on freedom of passage through the Straits for Russian warships as well as merchantmen. It was not Turkish strength but unrest in Russia (above all the great peasant and Cossack revolt of 1773-5 led by Emel’yan Pugachev in the southeastern parts of the country) which forced her to abandon these claims.
1 The Sublime Porte (Bab Ali) was the rather grandiloquent title given to the palace inhabited by the Grand Vizier, the chief minister of the Sultan, from 1654 onwards. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries it was widely used in western Europe, by extension, as a synonym for the Turkish central government as a whole.

1768-75 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 The dangerous weakness of the Ottoman Empire which was made explicit by the events of this war had been visible well before 1768. The Turkish army had long been declining in effectiveness. The feudal cavalry on which it had been largely based in the early days of the empire could not hope to make much impression on trained and disciplined troops, and the regular cavalry was in complete decay. The Janissaries (an infantry corps founded in the fourteenth century and originally recruited from Christian boys captured, conscripted or even bought by the Turks) had for long been the most famous and most efficient part of the Turkish army. But the corps was now in complete decay. It had become a privileged caste; most of its members were by the later eighteenth century artisans or tradesmen, soldiers only in name and formidable only to their own countrymen. Their lack of discipline made them a continual threat to public order, especially in the capital; and since the end of the sixteenth century several Sultans had been deposed and even murdered by them. At the same time their conservatism and determination to safeguard their own privileges made them an almost insuperable obstacle to real military reform. Technically, moreover, the Turkish army was now extremely backward, its artillery and engineers far below west-European or Russian standards of efficiency. The war of 1768-74 was thus fought mainly with troops supplied by powerful provincial governors, by the private armies of local grandees and by untrained and poorly disciplined volunteers. The Ottoman navy was also technically backward even in an age when the design of warships changed only very slowly. Its ships were often inadequately and haphazardly manned, and were usually navigated, not by Turks, but by Greeks, mainly from the islands and coastline of the Aegean. Its inefficiency was increased by the fact that, almost alone among the major navies of Europe, it did no fighting of any significance for half a century before the outbreak of war in 1768. The result was that when war came the Turkish officers, in the words of a contemporary, “dreaded the sight of a Russian cock-boat, and made use of every trifling excuse to avoid bringing their ships to action’.t The Turkish administrative system (the phrase conveys a suggestion of regularity and efficiency which is hardly justified by the facts) was now in decline. The empire had ceased to be a political unit in any real sense. It still stretched from the Persian Gulf to Bosnia, from the Caucasus to Yemen, and still claimed a shadowy suzerainty over the semi-piratical pseudo-states of Algiers, ‘Tunis and Tripoli. But this huge area, so varied in climate, language,

fresh imports of these slaves. One of the abler of these, Ali Bey, was able in 1770 to send forces to invade the Hedjaz and Yemen, and in the following year himself led an invasion of Syria. His financial demands on the country did much to accelerate the economic decline and social disintegration visible in Egypt by the end of the
century. It is true that the Ottoman Empire, even in its great days, had given its provincial governors much freedom of action; though it was always unwilling to allow the creation in the provinces of powerful and stable regimes controlled by local dynasties, even when these offered the best prospect of economic and administrative reform in the areas concerned. Moreover throughout the eighteenth century no outright revolt against Ottoman rule achieved permanent success anywhere. Even as late as 1774 the disunity which was increasingly showing itself seems to have aroused little real alarm in Constantinople. But it is clear that from about 1760 onwards the ramshackle structure of the empire was becoming more and more difficult to hold together. The task of maintaining what unity it had and governing it effectively was made even more difficult by the poor quality of most of the sultans. Since early in the seventeenth century nearly all of them had passed their lives, before their accession to the throne, immured in special pavilions in the palace of the ruler, with no company save that of a few eunuchs, slave-girls and servants. The complete denial of contact with the outside world which this ‘cage’ system involved produced a line of sultans dominated by ignorance, timidity and self-indulgence. Even a series of strong and able rulers could hardly have saved the empire from weakness and decline, for many of the evils from which it suffered were beyond the reach of purely political action. The majority of those it was given in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries did almost nothing to arrest the process of decay and something to accelerate it.4 The economic life of the empire was also in decline. For nearly two centuries it had failed to keep pace with the developments which were affecting much of western Europe and latterly even Russia. The great age of Ottoman conquest in the Balkans during the later fifteenth and much of the sixteenth centuries had seen a very remarkable growth of towns and urban life there. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, for reasons which are not entirely clear, this movement was reversed over much of the area. The Jewish and Armenian urban population, which had formerly played so great a

role in the tradeofmuch of the Balkans, was reduced, largely by emigration to western Europe. The Turkish population of many of the towns of the Balkans also fell. These developments had one very important and ultimately constructive result. They made the towns concerned more Greek, or Slav or Albanian, and thus reduced the language and other differences between their inhabitants and those of the surrounding countryside. Few Balkan states in the nineteenth century, therefore, suffered from so sharp a distinction in language, religion and national allegiance between their urban and rural populations as parts of Hungary and Poland did. Nevertheless the decline of urban life offered clear proof of the economic weakness of many parts of the Balkans in the eighteenth century, for the fall in urban population reflected a decline in that of rural areas also. In 1700 the Balkan peninsula had perhaps three or four times as many inhabitants as the kingdom of Hungary (most of which had just been reconquered by the Habsburgs from its former Turkish rulers and much of which was virtually uninhabited). A century later its population was probably less than that of Hungary.! It seems likely that the population of other and less studied parts of the empire, notably Syria, was also falling. Partly because of this declining population, partly because of the competition of European goods and other factors, the Ottoman Empire possessed hardly any industries organised on more than a handicraft basis until well into the nineteenth century. It remained in its foreign trade essentially an exporter of raw materials (silk, wool and cotton) to western Europe and an importer of manufactured articles and colonial products. Even this trade, which made parts of the empire quasi-colonies of the more advanced states of Europe, above all of France, was largely controlled by the influential groups of foreign merchants in such ports as Constantinople, Smyrna and Salonika. By the system of capitulations which had evolved since the sixteenth century, mainly on the initiative of France, these merchants were almost entirely exempt from Turkish taxation and the control of the Turkish courts. This was not in itself objectionable to the Turks or regarded by them as humiliating. But long before the eighteenth century the privileges enjoyed by Europeans had begun to be extended to their native protégés, who were usually Greeks, Armenians or Jews, while European ambassadors and ministers at the Porte had begun to sell this privileged status to Ottoman subjects. In 1774 the capitulatory system was not
as yet a serious Turkish grievance. But it was already playing an

appreciable role in the weakening of the empire, and especially of its economic life. Moreover since Moslems were debarred from lending money at interest the primitive banking facilities of the empire were completely in the hands of Christians and Jews. There is also some reason to believe that real wages, at least of unskilled labourers, were now declining steeply because of a serious rise in grain prices, and that this was helping to stimulate discontent and unrest.? The military, political and economic weaknesses of the Ottoman Empire were underlain and explained by its intellectual stagnation. Alone of the great states of Europe it had no universities or comparable institutions of higher secular education. It contributed nothing to the development of the physical sciences which was so marked a feature of eighteenth-century intellectual life. Intellectual and artistic activity was not entirely lacking to it; for until the later decades of the century, when really serious symptoms of approaching collapse began to show themselves, it continued to produce literature of a traditional sort (mainly poetry and historiography) and some considerable works of architecture. But this was an intellectual life of a limited, highly conservative and rather sterile kind. It had little capacity for growth and was dominated by official and religious models and requirements. The width of the intellectual gulf which now separated the rulers of the Ottoman Empire from those of western Europe can be seen in the continuing and perhaps growing influence at the Porte of the astrologers attached to the Sultan’s court. It is significant that Mustapha III (1757-73) seems to have attributed the successes of Frederick II of Prussia, not to the military or administrative organisation of his country, but to his possession of unusually able astrologers.” The Entpire’s failure to keep pace with the rest of Europe in intellectual matters is, however, illustrated best of all by the extraordinary slowness with which printing took root there. Not until 1727 did a firman of the Sultan Ahmad III authorise the printing of books in Turkish; and the government printing-press established in the following year functioned only till 1756 and printed only eighteen titles in all. It was revived in 1784, as one of the would-be reforming measures of Selim III; but by 1828, after a century of intermittent life, it had printed altogether only eighty titles. In almost every aspect of life, therefore, the Ottoman Empire in the later eighteenth century ‘had remained or reverted to a medieval state, with a medieval mentality and a medieval economy—but with

the added burden of a bureaucracy and a standing army which no
medieval state had ever had to bear’! Its failure to develop,
moreover, was underlined by the fact that since the later seventeenth century Russia, formerly far poorer, less well governed and less civilised, had been rapidly modernising her administration, her army and to some extent her economic life. In the adoption of new techniques and ideas she had, by the end of the eighteenth century, far outstripped the decaying giant whom she now confronted across the Black Sea.
The reasons for this stagnation and even regression in almost every aspect of life in the Ottoman Empire from the sixteenth century onwards now seem fairly clear. The most important was the power and nature of Moslem religious institutions. Until well into the sixteenth century the ulema, the class of religious leaders and teachers, had consisted on the whole of men of integrity, often unworldly and of real learning. By the end of that century many of its members were acquiring increasing wealth and power and it was becoming, like the Janissaries, more and more a privileged hereditary group dedicated to the defence of its own interests. This disastrous trend continued during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. By the time of Kutchuk-Kainardji it was clear that any significant modernisation of the Ottoman Empire would be bitterly opposed by this profoundly conservative force, which could draw support from a vast fund of unthinking popular dislike of change. Any new institution—such as an efficient bureaucracy or a modern armywhich might be used to reduce the power of the ulema would have to face the full weight of their hostility. The dismissal and murder in 1785 of the Grand Vizier Halil Pasha, who had made some effort to modernise the army, showed how effective that hostility might be. In other ways also religious forces weakened the empire. Its Christian subjects, who over much of the Balkans and in some Asiatic provinces made up a majority of the population, were in various ways treated as inferiors. They were debarred from the higher ranks of the bureaucracy and the army and subject to various discriminatory taxes. They were not persecuted in any genuine sense of the term. Indeed by the workings of the millet system? the various

Porte and held responsible by it for the actions of his followers. Each millet was
defined purely in terms of religion, without regard to language, ethnic factors or
geography. In some cases (among the Nestorians and Assyrian Christians) the

Churches between which the Christians of the empire were divided were given considerable autonomy in the regulation of their own affairs. But the rigidity of the barriers which divided them from Moslems and from each other meant that the Ottoman Empire was internally divided in a way and to an extent unknown in western Europe. Its subjects were still classified in purely religious terms. The idea of a secular state was unknown and inconceivable. The Sultan was also the Caliph, the protector of the Holy Law (though this made little difference to his effective authority and he was never given the great historic title, borne by the early successors of Mohammed, of Commander of the Faithful (Amir ul-Mw’minin) ). Compared with the great cleavage between Moslem rulers and Christian subjects the other divisions within the empire — between the orthodox Sunni form of Islam and the heretical Shia form which had many followers in Mesopotamia and a few other areas; between the numerous brotherhoods, of differing orthodoxy, into which the Sunnis were now divided; between Turks and Arabs in Syria and Egypt; between settled and nomadic groups in the Arab areas, Anatolia and Albania; between different tribes in Albania and Kurdistan — were less important though far from negligible. But clearly Ottoman society in the later eighteenth century was very far indeed from being a unity. It was a complex aggregation of differing and often mutually hostile societies. Even before the disasters of 1768-74 there had been signs that some Turks recognised the need for change, even drastic change, if the empire were to survive. The Grand Vizier Ibrahim Pasha during his long tenure of office (1718-30) had sent a mission to study French institutions and methods of government with a view to their possible adoption in Turkey. The influence of European technology, above all in military affairs, had grown considerably in the two generations before Kutchuk-Kainardji. Christian renegades like the Frenchman Bonneval (Ahmed Pasha), who served in the Turkish army for nearly two decades before his death in 1747, or experts like the Baron de Tott, who was sent by the French government in 1768 to help in the reorganisation of the Turkish artillery and the
position of head of the millet (millet-bashi) had become hereditary, or at least confined to members of a single family, towards the end of the seventeenth century. The Orthodox millet divided in the nineteenth century, along national and linguistic lines, into four smaller ones; and this, coupled with the formation of a Protestant millet in 1850 meant that by the early twentieth century there were no less than fourteen such groups recognised by the Turkish authorities. It should perhaps be added that the craft guilds (which were often very powerful in the cities) were not usually divided along religious lines and acted to some extent as a link between different religious groups.

fortification of the Dardanelles, had striven to modernise the empire’s fighting forces. In a few areas where there was a significant Catholic population European intellectual forces of a more fundamental kind had made some slight impression. But these new influences had been very limited and superficial in their effects. The Ottoman Empire in 1774 was still stagnant and archaic. Its chances of survival now seemed to many observers very small.

From the moment of the signature of the treaty it was clear that the Turkish government would do its utmost to disregard some of its provisions. Catherine II ratified it in August 1774, almost as soon as news of its conclusion reached her in St. Petersburg; but it at once became obvious that the Porte was extremely reluctant to follow suit. Resmi-Achmed Effendi, one of the Turkish signatories, was disgraced as soon as the peace terms had been digested at Constantinople. His colleague, the Grand Vizier Muhsinzadé Pasha, escaped the same fate only by dying a few days after peace had been made. The Sheikh-ul-Islam, the supreme religious dignitary of the Ottoman Empire, who had publicly declared acceptance of Russia’s terms to be unavoidable, lost his post and was replaced by a strong opponent of the treaty. More serious, Turkish forces landed in the ostensibly independent Crimea in July, and Field-Marshal Rumyantsev, the Russian commander, was thereupon ordered to halt the evacuation of Turkish territory by his troops. The efforts of the Porte to escape from the terms of KutchukKainardji were seen with a good deal of sympathy by some of the European powers, above all by France. Since the accession of
Catherine II in 1762 Franco—Russian relations had been consistently
bad. Sweden, Poland and the Ottoman Empire, all in varying
degrees in decline, were traditional protégés of France. Since the
reign of Louis XIV they had been weapons in France’s efforts to
restrain the growth of Habsburg and later of Russian power. They

1762-74 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 had never been reliable or effective weapons and by the 1770s a good many Frenchmen were increasingly conscious of their defects. Yet the threat which Russia now seemed to offer to their interests, indeed to their very existence, could not but arouse much hostility in France. In 1764 Catherine II, with the help of Frederick II of Prussia, had imposed on the Poles a king of her own choice, Stanislas Poniatowski. In 1772-3 she had played a leading role in the first of the partitions which were soon to wipe Poland off the map of Europe. During the years before 1768 the French government had repeatedly urged the Porte to intervene forcibly to defend Poland against Russian pressure; and these urgings were partly responsible for the war, so disastrous to the Turks, which broke out in that year. Catherine’s efforts to keep Sweden impotent and divided had been frustrated, it was true, by the revolution of August 1772 in Stockholm which re-established many of the powers of the Swedish monarchy. But her defeat and humiliation of the Ottoman Empire, essentially a far more powerful state than Poland or Sweden and one which provided a great market for French exports, seemed to mark her more clearly than ever as the great enemy of French influence in Europe. Moreover the progress of the Pugachev revolt had encouraged French statesmen to believe that the Russian armies in the Balkans would remain on the defensive during the campaign of 1774 and that Catherine II might be driven to make peace on very moderate terms. The treaty of Kutchuk-Kainardji thus came as an unpleasant shock to them. On 26 August 1774 the British ambassador in Paris noted, no doubt with a good deal of pleasure, that the French ministers ‘are most horribly disappointed with the Turkish peace’,! while a week earlier the French representative at Constantinople, the Comte de Saint-Priest, had urged the Porte to delay ratification of the treaty and if possible prolong the peace negotiations. To the French it seemed, quite correctly, that the ‘independence’ of the Crimea was worthless and that the peninsula must soon fall under Russian dominance.” Russia, having gained an outlet to the Black Sea, might be able to construct a powerful fleet there and with it launch an attack, perhaps without any declaration of war, against the Turkish capital. Such an attack would probably succeed; if it did it might sweep away at a blow the whole increasingly flimsy

structure of the Ottoman Empire and completely overturn the European balance of power. This fear, exaggerated as it may now seem, was by no means confined to Paris. Baron Thugut, the Austrian representative at Constantinople, in one of the most interesting contemporary comments on the peace, foresaw that soon Russia would be able, with a favouring wind, to transport in 36-48 hours a force of 20,000 men from Kerch to Constantinople. Such an attack, if timed to coincide with a rising of the Porte’s Christian subjects, would force the Sultan to flee ‘au fond de |’Asie’ and lead to the submission to Russia of the whole of Greece with its islands and the coasts of Asia Minor. So effective was this mode of attack on the Ottoman Empire, he went on, that it was unlikely that Russia would ever again fight a land war against it in the Balkans. Whether Russia, had she attempted an attack of this kind on the Turkish capital in the later eighteenth century, could have successfully carried it out, is an interesting though profitless speculation. Her failure to make any effort of this kind certainly surprised a good many contemporaries; and it is one of the more remarkable aspects of the history of the Eastern Question that until a hundred years later? the idea of striking at the Turks in this way should have aroused little serious attention in St. Petersburg. The Porte, in its struggle to avoid ratification of the treaty of Kutchuk-Kainardji, was thus strengthened by the sympathy of France, for what it was worth, and by the fact that the Tatars of the Crimea clearly did not want independence. It was weakened, on the other hand, by war-weariness, by lack of money and by the hostility of Kerim Khan, one of the short-lived despots who occupied the Persian throne in the later eighteenth century. Moreover no great power save France showed the slightest inclination to give the Turks any real support against the demands of Catherine II. To Britain, now in any case deep in American difficulties, the Near East was still of no direct political importance and of little economic significance. T’o Prussia it was equally unimportant, while Frederick II was determined to avoid at almost any cost serious friction with Russia. The Habsburg Empire had been since 1756, at least on paper, the ally of France. Moreover the Emperor Joseph II had

THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE 1774-6 already shown himself, in 1770-1, bitterly hostile to any large territorial gains by Russia in the Balkans. But the Habsburgs were in no position to embark lightly on a war with Catherine II in which the latter would certainly be supported by Prussia, and Joseph was soon to show himself as greedy as Catherine for Turkish territory. The result of this weakness and relative isolation of the Porte was that by October 1774 it was beginning to show signs of giving way. In January 1775 the treaty was at last ratified by the Sultan. The execution of many of its clauses was still to come, however, and the situation was complicated by the fact that many of the other European states were clearly anxious to benefit from Russia’s victories. France, Great Britain, the Dutch Republic and Venice had all had their appetites whetted by the concession to Russian ships of the right of free navigation on the Black Sea. Almost at once the Porte found itself bombarded by their representatives at Constantinople with demands that this right be extended to vessels of other states. These demands the Turkish ministers were able to resist; but the territorial claims of the Habsburg Empire were much more difficult fo cope with. Joseph II, always avid for territory, occupied in September 1774 part of the area known as the Bukovina, on the northern frontier of Moldavia, justifying his action by the need to improve Austria’s communications between Transylvania and the province of Galicia acquired in the first partition of Poland. In spite of the urgings of the war party at the Porte it was clear that the Turks were in no position to resist by force this new attack on their empire. An effort to secure Russian meditation was a failure and Frederick II of Prussia, though he saw with jealousy any growth of Habsburg power, did nothing to help the Turks effectively. The result was that by an agreement signed at Constantinople on 7 May 1775 the Bukovina was ceded to Austria, though she agreed not to build fortifications there. Two conventions of May and July 1776 provided for the delimitation in detail of the new frontier. Rumyantsev, still in command of the Russian army in the Danubian Principalities, did not co-operate with the Austrians during the Bukovina dispute. In particular he refused to hand over to them the important Turkish fortress of Khotin, which was still in Russian hands. Nevertheless the attitude of Joseph II (who was already thinking in terms of an agreement with Catherine II for their mutual profit in the Balkans) considerably weakened the opposition which the Porte could offer to Russia;1 and General

Prince N. V. Repnin, who was sent to Constantinople in April 1775 to supervise the carrying-out of the treaty of Kutchuk-Kainardji, had instructions to use Austrian ambitions in the Principalities as a means of putting pressure on the Turks. Nevertheless he found his task very difficult. Though he resisted successfully the preposterous demands of the Turkish ministers for the ending of the independence of the Crimea and the return of Kerch and Yenikalé he was unable to overcome the obstruction by which they tried to prevent the full execution of many of the terms of the treaty. Increasingly, attention in both St. Petersburg and Constantinople was becoming focused on by far the greatest of the problems posed by Kutchuk-Kainardji— the fate of the Crimea. Throughout 1775-6 a struggle for power developed there between the Russian candidate for the position of Khan, Schahin-Guerai, who was also supported by the Nogai tribesmen of the Crimean steppe, and his rival, Devlet-Guerai, who was backed by the Porte. By the spring of 1777 Devlet-Guerai had been forced to abandon the struggle; but in October a serious revolt broke out against Schahin-Guerai and for a few months another Russo-Turkish war seemed almost inevitable. The war party had now temporarily gained the upper hand in Constantinople and in January 1778 it was decided to send troops to the Crimea to support the rebels there. Schahin-Guerai had already asked for the backing of Russian forces and an armed clash seemed imminent. Good luck and the vacillations of the Porte prevented its taking place. The Turkish fleet destined for the Crimea was delayed in the Bosphorus for nearly six weeks by unfavourable winds; and when it reached Crimean waters in the second half of August it merely cruised there ineffectively, without attempting a landing, until autumn gales forced it to take refuge in Sinope at the end of September and then return to Constantinople. Clearly the Porte could not decide whether it wanted peace or war with Russia. The forces making for conflict were powerful; but against them had to be set the fact that there was still no help to be expected from the states of western Europe in a new struggle with Catherine II. France from the spring of 1778 onwards was deeply involved in a great maritime and colonial war with Britain and had no resources to spare for the active support of the Ottoman Empire against Russia. The Comte de Saint-Priest, her very able ambassador at Constantinople, repeatedly urged upon the Porte the foolhardiness of provoking a new war for which it was hopelessly unprepared. The Austrian government had urged the Turks in January 1778 to
buy off Austrian hostility and thus free the hands of the Turkish government for more effective resistance to Russian demands.

THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE 1775-82 settle peacefully their dispute with Russia over the Crimea, while
the war of the Bavarian Succession against Prussia, in which it became involved in July, absorbed its attention and energies for most of the next year. Isolated and leaderless, the Porte gave way. On 21 March 1779, thanks in part to the diplomacy of Saint-Priest, it signed with Russia the convention of Ainali-Kavak. In essentials this was a reiteration and confirmation of the treaty of KutchukKainardji, but in one or two respects it diverged from the terms laid down in 1774. The Porte recognised Schahin-Guerai as ruler of the Crimea; but in future each new Khan, on his accession, was to make a formal request for the approval of the Sultan, in his capacity as Caliph, of his assumption of the throne. The Sultan, however, must give this approval and do so in a form of words which he could not alter. The religious ties between the Crimea and the Ottoman Empire were thus recognised by Russia; but the Porte had to confirm the political independence of the Tartars and abandon the use of religious pretexts for political intervention in the Crimea. The area between the rivers Bug and Dniester, hitherto part of the Crimean Khanate, was to fall under Turkish control; but most of it was to be left uninhabited to act as a buffer between the Ottoman Empire, Russia and the dominions of the Khan. A Russo-Turkish commercial treaty was to be negotiated (this was not in fact done till 1783). Russia had thus gained, at the price of a few minor concessions, the substance of her demands — a fresh recognition of the political independence of the Crimea. But the upheavals of the last five years had by now produced in St. Petersburg a growing belief that this independence, which the Russian government in 1774 had sincerely desired, could never be more than a sham and that the peninsula must, sooner or later, become a part of Russia. The efforts of Catherine II and her government to strengthen Russia’s position on the Black Sea were not merely military and diplomatic ones. The development of an extensive Russian trade there, and through the Straits to the Mediterranean and western Europe, had seemed one of the main advantages to be expected from the treaty of Kutchuk-Kainardji; and the Russian government was anxious to foster such a trade. Efforts were made in 1775 and 1782 to do this by means of preferential tariffs, while in the former year the destruction of the remaining autonomy of the Zaporozhian Cossacks on the Don seemed to pave the way still further for a growth of trade between south Russia and the outside world. In 1778 the port of Kherson was founded on the short stretch of Black Sea coastline which Russia had acquired four years earlier; its
growth was rapid and its possibilities as a trading centre soon began
7


1774-86 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
to attract the attention of merchants from western and central Europe. By 1786 it had a population of 10,000. Almost from the
moment of its creation, moreover, it was developed as a naval base as wellasa centre of trade. The Empress was beginning to acquire the Black Sea squadron whose effectiveness as a weapon against Constantinople some contemporaries so much dreaded. Catherine also made liberal use, after 1774, of the right to station consuls and vice-consuls in the Ottoman Empire which she had acquired at KutchukKainardji, so that some years later an irritated Frenchman wrote, ‘There is not a rock in the Archipelago where there is not to be found a Greek in Russian uniform exercising an authority which is tyrannical towards the Turkish chiefs and insulting towards the agents of the great powers.’! These efforts to develop Russian trade had little immediate result. The ships which called at Kherson in its early years were mainly small Greek vessels sailing under the Russian flag. The growth of a truly Russian merchant marine in the Black Sea was still to come, and in the mid-1780s the Russian Black Sea ports handled only 2-3°%, of the country’s foreign trade. Nevertheless it was clear that the peace of 1774 might in time make very considerable changes in the pattern of European commerce. The convention of Ainali-Kavak could not and did not end the tension between Russia and the Ottoman Empire. No end to it was likely as long as the decline of Turkish power continued; and by the end of the 1770s and the early 1780s it was clear that that decline was, if anything, gathering speed. Increasingly some areas of the Balkans were turning to the Empire’s great Christian neighbours, Austria and Russia, for support against their Turkish overlords. Thus in the summer of 1781 deputies from Montenegro were in Vienna seeking Austrian help against the Porte, while two years later a number of Moldavian boyars were seeking Habsburg protection against rule from Constantinople. Moreover the Ottoman Empire was now confronted with a new and very dangerous threat in the form of an Austro—Russian alliance embodied in letters exchanged between Catherine IT and Joseph II in May 1781. This alliance was based on a guarantee by each sovereign of the territories of the other, of the other’s existing treaties with the Turks and of the position in Poland. It was also inspired, however, by dreams of joint action against Turkey and a possible partition of its European provinces. Catherine was already playing with grandiose schemes for the creation of a “Greek Empire’, perhaps with her grandson,
the Grand Duke Constantine, as ruler. This might embrace not

only the areas of Greek population but also Bulgaria, Thrace and Macedonia, as well as Constantinople. Moldavia and Wallachia might become an autonomous state under Russian influence, perhaps ruled by the Empress’s favourite, Prince G. A. Potemkin, while Russia herself must have the Crimea, the Kuban and the area between the Bug and Dniester which had been recognised as Turkish in 1779. In November 1782 Joseph accepted these huge demands, though with a notable lack of enthusiasm. He asked in return for the western part of Wallachia, a large part of Serbia, including Belgrade, and the Venetian possessions in Istria and Dalmatia. (Venice was to be compensated with the Morea, Crete and Cyprus.) These ambitious plans were totally impracticable. In particular it was clear almost from the moment the alliance was concluded that Joseph, hampered by the hostility of Frederick II in Germany, was most unwilling to commit himself in the Balkans unless he were sure of being able to maintain good relations with France. Nevertheless the alliance did a good deal to strengthen Catherine’s hand in dealing with the new crisis which was emerging in the Crimea. Early in 1781 another revolt against the unpopular SchahinGuerai broke out. He was once more restored by Russian troops and Batyr-Guerai, who had been proclaimed Khan in his place, driven out; but the idea of ending this continual turmoil by a Russian annexation was becoming more and more attractive to the Empress and her ministers. It was supported by A. A. Bezborodko, her chief adviser on foreign affairs, and above all by the all-powerful Potemkin. By December 1782, Catherine had decided that Russia must have at least the port of Sevastopol as compensation for the losses and expenses she had incurred in the restoration of SchahinGuerai. On 19 April 1783, probably under the influence of Potemkin, she issued a manifesto which proclaimed the annexation by Russia of the Crimea, the Kuban and the Taman peninsula. On the same day Schahin-Guerai abdicated and returned to Russia to live there on a pension granted him by the Empress. These events produced an explosion of indignation in Constantinople. For several months there was a real danger of another Russo—Turkish war. But Turkish opinion, though deeply hostile to Russia, was confused, leaderless and justifiably pessimistic about the likely outcome of a new struggle. To recover the Crimea Turkey needed a powerful ally; and that ally could only be France, for generations her traditional friend and supporter. Yet the French government in 1783 was unable and unwilling to intervene actively on behalf of the Turks. It was unable to act effectively partly because at the time of

Catherine’s proclamation and for several months afterwards it was
still at war with Great Britain. The struggle over American Inde
pendence was clearly coming to an end by the latter months of 1782;
but the definitive treaty of Versailles, which made peace between
Great Britain, France and Spain, was not signed till September
1783. The British cabinet led by Lord Shelburne, which was in
power till February of that year, was in many ways hostile to Russia.
But it was quite unresponsive to the very tentative advances which
Vergennes, the French Foreign Minister, made to it for diplomatic support against Catherine II, while Shelburne’s successor, Charles James Fox, could scarcely admit the possibility of Anglo-French co-operation on any issue whatever. More important, Prince Kaunitz, the Austrian Chancellor, made it clear at the end of March that the Habsburg dominions would give France no help in resisting a Russian seizure of the Crimea. This attitude the Austrian government never modified. Joseph II, who feared a Prussian attack on his northern frontiers if he became too deeply involved in the Balkans, refused to take advantage of Catherine’s action by attacking Moldavia and Wallachia as Kaunitz advised. He now felt for his Russian ally increasing distrust and a respect bordering on fear. But although he was unwilling to co-operate actively with Catherine II against the Turks he never dreamed of opposing her, even by purely diplomatic means, in spite of the urgings of the French government. Austrian opposition to her schemes might well throw Catherine II into the arms of Frederick II of Prussia; and the isolation and weakening of Prussia were still the Emperor’s supreme objectives. By July 1783 relations between France and Austria, still formally allies, had become so bad that a number of French ministers were urging an attack on the Austrian Netherlands and perhaps the Austrian possessions in Italy if Joseph II attempted to seize the Danubian Principalities. Disappointed in London and Vienna, the French government turned, desperately yet half-heartedly, to Prussia for support; but a series of tentative negotiations in Berlin in AugustOctober 1783 produced no result. This was because the French government, in spite of many disappointments, felt unable openly to
abandon the alliance of 1756 with Austria; and without such an
abandonment nothing more than a purely defensive agreement with
Frederick II was possible.

bankruptcy, was not an opponent to inspire fear. ‘France’, wrote a Russian diplomat, ‘is at the moment without armies and above all without money. Before taking action she needs a breathing-space of two or three years, and if we have not finished the business [the annexation of the Crimea] by then, we should never have started it.”4 More fundamental still, however, as a force inhibiting action by France, was a growing doubt in Paris whether the Ottoman Empire could be preserved or was worth preserving. Vergennes had himself served as French minister in Constantinople for thirteen years (1755-68) and knew well how difficult it would be to transform the empire into an effective modern state. His successor in the Turkish capital, Saint-Priest, had proposed as early as 1770 that France should accept the partition of Turkey which was sooner or later unavoidable and take Egypt as her share of the spoils. This idea, once put forward, was never forgotten in Paris. The psychological foundations of Napoleon’s invasion of Egypt had been laid long before the revolution of 1789. Such support as France was able to give the Porte in 1783, therefore, was undermined at its source by a growing feeling that the country’s traditional Turcophil attitude was outdated and unrealistic. The Turkish government, isolated and impotent, had thus to recognise the inevitable. On 22 December 1783 the Austrian minister in Constantinople presented a declaration which made it clear that if a Russo—Turkish war broke out Catherine II would be actively supported by Austria. The veiled threat was successful. A war with her two great neighbours might well end in the destruction of the Ottoman Empire, and on January 8 the Porte at last recognised the annexation of the Crimea, the Kuban and the Taman peninsula to the Russian Empire. Almost simultaneously, moreover, Catherine II was greatly extending her influence in the Caucasus, an area almost as important to the Turks. In August 1783 a treaty with King Irakli of Kartlo-Kakhetia, the most important of the petty kingdoms into which Georgia was divided, made the little state a Russian protectorate. In November two Russian battalions were sent to Tiflis, its capital, and a year later the fortress of Vladikavkaz was built to protect the communications between the new protectorate and Russia proper; it was to become the main centre for the Russian conquest of the whole of the northern Caucasus. Already Potemkin was dreaming of an Armenian kingdom under Russian control and perhaps of a new Russian-dominated state to be set up in Azerbaijan. The Crimean crisis had shown that the growth of Russian power

in the Near East was accelerating. It had also shown that the influence of France in the area was in rapid decline, that she was no longer able to act as the main protector of the Ottoman Empire and that her policies in the Levant were changing. The French government attempted, in the middle and later 1780s, to maintain its influence at Constantinople by mediating in an Austro—Turkish frontier dispute of 1785 and by supplying the Turks, as it had been doing for the last fifteen years, with technicians and military experts. These efforts had little success. In particular the Porte steadily refused French demands for the opening of the Black Sea to French merchant ships, an attitude which seemed to many Frenchmen grossly ungrateful.1 In November 1786 Choiseul-Gouffier, the French minister in Constantinople, even suggested that he should leave the Turkish capital for some months as a demonstration of French disapproval, and by July of the following year the government in Paris was thinking of passing French merchantmen forcibly through the Straits under the protection of a squadron of men-ofwar. With this deterioration in Franco—Turkish relations went a slow improvement in those between Paris and St. Petersburg. In January 1787 a Franco—Russian commercial agreement was signed. By the spring of the following year fairly serious negotiations were in progress for a defensive alliance between the two states which would be joined by Austria and perhaps by Spain. There were many obstacles in the way of the conclusion of such an alliance, but one of the most important was the fact that from August 1787 Russia and from February 1788 Austria were at war with the Porte. This new Russo—Turkish war, whose outbreak had been so long and so often expected, had several causes. The most important was the struggle for influence in the Caucasus. The Russian protectorate over much of Georgia established in the summer of 1783 was greatly resented by the Turks and their Caucasian Moslem allies, especially by the warlike Lesghians of Daghestan. In 1784-5 Georgian territory was repeatedly attacked and raided by the Lesghians, and by the end of the latter year Russo—Turkish tension had become acute. In November 1785 the Russian government threatened ‘serious measures’ if the attacks did not cease. In the following year it gave weight to the threat by raising considerable forces from the Caucasian peoples under its control — the Ingushes,
? From 1781 onwards an enterprising French merchant, Anthoine, managed to build up a considerable trade between Kherson and Marseilles, particularly in masts from the great forests of Lithuania; but this was carried on by ships flying the Russian, not the French, flag. See his Essai historique sur le commerce et la navigation de la Mer Noire (Paris, 1820), passim.

Simultaneously other sources of friction were appearing between Russia and Turkey. The activities of the consuls whom the Porte had reluctantly allowed Catherine II to establish in Bucharest and Jassy in December 1781 annoyed the Turkish government intensely, as did the actions of some of Russia’s vice-consuls in the Greek islands. Catherine’s refusal to admit Turkish consuls to her dominions added to this annoyance. Also the action of the Porte in deposing, in December 1786, Alexander Mavrocordatos, the Hospodar of Wallachia, who took refuge in Russia, led to immediate complaints from St. Petersburg.? In the late summer of 1787, just as the normal campaigning season was coming to an end, the Turkish ministers suddenly brought matters to a head. On 26 July an ultimatum was presented to Bulgakov. It embodied a long series of demands — the handing over of Mavrocordatos; the recall of Russian consuls from Bucharest, Jassy and Alexandria; the establishment of Turkish consuls in all Russian seaports and trading towns; a recognition that King Erakli was a Turkish subject; the right to inspect all ships leaving the Black Sea under the Russian flag. Bulgakov refused to receive this document, and on 13 August he was summoned before the divan and presented with a demand for the return of the Crimea to Turkish suzerainty. Three days later he was imprisoned in the Seven Towers fortress, the traditional Turkish method of declaring war on a
foreign state. Hostilities began early in September, and on 26
November a council held in St. Petersburg defined Russia’s war
aims — the acquisition of the fortresses of Ochakov and Akkermann
at the mouths of the Bug and Dniester respectively and the creation
of an independent state covering the Principalities and Bessarabia.
1 By a decree issued early in 1784 at the prompting of Bulgakov, the Sultan had
promised not to depose the Hospodars in future except as a punishment for some specific offence,
13


1787-8 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 The Russian army and fleet were unprepared for war (as they had been in 1768) and had somewhat mixed fortune in the early stages of the conflict. The unstable Potemkin even envisaged an evacuation of the Crimea and wished to resign his position as supreme Russian commander. Nor was Russia’s international position very happy. Joseph II could not deny that the casus foederis under his alliance of 1781 with Russia had arisen. But he did not pretend to like the prospect which was now opening before him — ‘a war’, he wrote to his brother Leopold at the end of August 1787, ‘to be fought in those accursed countries, in the midst of every disease, of plague, of hunger, and all to gain little’.t In this frame of mind he was unlikely to prove the most effective of allies when he reluctantly declared war on the Porte on 9 February 1788. Much more serious from Catherine’s point of view, in July 1788 Gustavus III of Sweden suddenly attacked Russia, hoping to recover the Baltic and Finnish provinces which Sweden had lost earlier in the century. For a short time St. Petersburg was in danger of capture by the Swedes. Worse still there were now unmistakable signs that Prussia, and perhaps also Great Britain, were likely to become serious opponents of Russia in the Near East. In the autumn of 1787 these two powers had combined to crush the pro-French ‘patriot’ party in the United Provinces and to restore the power of the Stadtholder there. In August 1788 the signature of a defensive alliance between them marked the emergence of a new combination of states which was for the next three years to play a leading role in European affairs. In Berlin it seemed that the alliance with Britain and the preoccupation of Russia and Austria with the Turkish war might lead to important territorial gains for Prussia. Joseph II, it was hoped, might be induced by the prospect of large acquisitions in the Balkans and by the threat of Prussian attack on his north-western frontiers to cede to the Poles the province of Galicia, acquired by the Habsburgs in the first partition of Poland in 1772. Poland in exchange would hand over to Prussia the autonomous city of Danzig and the province of Thorn (Torun) thus rounding off the eastern frontiers of the Hohenzollern dominions. This complex, cynical and impracticable scheme, typical in many ways of the international relations of the age, had been drawn up by Count Hertzberg, one of the Prussian Secretaries of State, at the end of 1787. It was to dominate Prussian diplomacy for nearly three years. Since it depended for its success on the effective bullying of Austria, Russia’s ally, and on co-operation with Poland, Russia’s victim, it had from the beginning anti

THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE 1787-90 Russian implications. (Though Hertzberg was willing to allow Catherine IT, when she made peace with the Porte, to take Bessarabia and Ochakov.) In August 1789 the Russian government, in an effort to improve relations with Prussia and to reach agreement with her on the peace terms to be imposed on the Turks, sent to Berlin on a special mission the ablest diplomat at its disposal, M. M. Alopeus; but this produced no result. True, Hertzberg’s schemes cut no ice in London, where there was still a hankering after some form of alliance with the Habsburgs, Britain’s allies during most of the first half of the century. Moreover the British government continued for some time after 1787 to regard Russia as a traditional friend, a state to which Britain was united by strong and profitable commercial ties and by a mutual hostility to France. This meant that from the beginning the Anglo—Prussian alliance was shaky and unreliable. Nevertheless by the summer of 1788 Joseph II, now facing acute difficulties with his subjects in Hungary and the Austrian Netherlands, was becoming very worried by the possibility ofa Prussian attack on Bohemia and Moravia; and by the end of the year Catherine II had decided that the international situation and the mediocre achievements of her armies made impossible the creation of a new kingdom in the Principalities. However she had still some strong cards to play. In particular it soon became clear that the intervention of Sweden, though it had been of considerable help to the Turks, was a much less serious threat to Russia than had at first appeared. Within a few weeks of his declaration of war Gustavus III was forced temporarily to suspend operations by a serious mutiny in the Swedish army. Hardly had he reasserted his position than he was faced, in September 1788, by a Danish declaration of war. This was followed by an invasion by the Danes of southern Sweden from which he was rescued only by energetic Anglo—Prussian diplomatic support and by a threatened Prussian attack on Jutland. As well as forcing the Danes to conclude an armistice Britain and Prussia gave Gustavus some financial support, much to the indignation of Catherine IT. He was also able to conclude a rather ineffective alliance and subsidy treaty with the Porte in July 1789. But his war with Russia was a failure. It saw only one important Swedish victory (in the naval battle of Svenksund in July 1790) and in August of that year, at Verela in Finland, the Swedes made peace on terms which restored the status quo of 1788 in the Baltic. The Ottoman Empire and its interests were not mentioned at all in the treaty; and almost as soon as it had been signed Gustavus opened negotiations in St. Petersburg and Copenhagen for a Russo—SwedishDanish alliance to be directed against the revolutionaries in France.
5)


1790-1 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 Catherine II had thus freed herself from the distraction of a war in the Baltic. But even before the treaty of Verela had been signed Austria had agreed to make peace with the Porte and thus to leave Russia to struggle alone with the Turks. Leopold II, who succeeded his elder brother Joseph If in February 1790, had always distrusted Catherine and knew well how weak the position of the Habsburg Empire really was. In particular the threat of Prussian attack now seemed acute. On 31 January 1790 Dietz, the Prussian minister at Constantinople, grossly exceeding his instructions, had signed with the Porte a treaty by which Prussia agreed to enter the struggle against Russia and Austria in the spring of 1791. She was also to secure the recovery by the Ottoman Empire of the Crimea and all the territory lost since the outbreak of the war. In March a Prusso—Polish defensive alliance directed against Russia was concluded, while the military party which now seemed to be in the ascendant in Berlin was urging an immediate attack on Bohemia. Such an attack it was assumed, probably correctly, must lead to the surrender of the Habsburgs to Prussian demands; when this had been achieved terms could be imposed on Russia with the help of the Turks, the British and the Poles. Faced by this threat, Leopold II wrote immediately after his accession a personal letter to Frederick William II of Prussia urging the need to improve Austro—Prussian relations. By April negotiations between the two states for a settlement of their differences were under way. There were still serious obstacles in the way of any agreement. In particular Hertzberg, with powerful support in Berlin, continued to demand that Leopold should cede at least part of Galicia to Poland and thus pave the way for the Prussian acquisition of Danzig and Thorn. Nevertheless on 26 June a conference between representatives of the two powers met at Reichenbach in Silesia. A fortnight later Frederick William II suddenly decided to make a settlement with Austria on the basis of the status quo. He took this surprising decision partly because he was a weak, irresolute and changeable man; and partly also because he realised that neither his British nor his Polish allies had much liking for Hertzberg’s exchange scheme. By the convention of Reichenbach of 27 July 1790 Leopold II agreed to make peace with the Turks through the mediation of Britain, Prussia and the Dutch; and on 4 August 1791, after eight months of exceptionally tedious negotiations, an Austro—Turkish peace treaty was signed at Sistovo in Bulgaria. By it (strictly speaking by a separate convention attached to it) Leopold II received Old Orsova and the area around it in the Banat, north of the Iron Gate on the Danube, though he was not to fortify his new acquisitions.
16


THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE 1787-91
The fact that Austria made peace in this way could be regarded, and has often since been regarded by German historians, as a diplomatic victory for Prussia. In reality the Reichenbach agreement was much more a triumph for the Emperor, who retained Galicia and warded off the Prussian attack which he so much feared, The strong position of Prussia was inadequately exploited in the negotiations of June-July 1790 and found little effective expression in the terms of the convention. The second half of 1790 and the early months of 1791 were dominated by the growth of tension between Russia and Prussia, and still more between Russia and Great Britain. Prussia’s commitments to the Turks and Poles, which meant that for a time she assumed the traditional role of France in eastern Europe, help to explain the first of these antagonisms. The second is more difficult to account for. Until the later 1780s no British government took much serious interest in the affairs of the Near East, where little of value to Britain seemed to be at stake, and there was no desire in London to hinder Russian expansion there. However the part played by Catherine II in creating the Armed Neutrality of 1780, which bound together in opposition to Britain during the American war almost all the neutral maritime states of Europe, had shaken the assumption hitherto accepted in London that Russia was a natural ally against France. The signature in 1787 of a Russo—French commercial treaty had the same effect, while by the early months of that year there were signs that Russian power in Europe was beginning to arouse uneasiness, perhaps even opposition, in the minds of some members of the cabinet. Sir Robert Ainslie, the arrogant and incompetent British ambassador in Constantinople, undoubtedly encouraged the Turks to make war on Russia; and his activities were not disapproved of by the Foreign Secretary, the Marquess of Carmarthen. In the early months of 1788 the British government refused to help in any way the despatch of a Russian fleet from the Baltic to the Mediterranean. It thus deeply angered and disappointed Catherine II, who, inspired by memories of what had been achieved in 1770, had placed great hopes in the effect of naval action by Russia in the Levant. In the spring of 1789 the Prime Minister, William Pitt, now increasingly worried by the insatiable expansionism which seemed to inspire Russian policy, even made overtures to France for joint mediation to end the Russo—-Turkish war on the basis of the status quo ante
bellum. Simultaneously Joseph Ewart, the energetic young minister in
Berlin, was urging on the British government the creation of a great ‘federative system’, an alliance of Britain, Prussia, Sweden,
17


1790-1 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
Denmark, Poland, the Dutch and the Turks to force Catherine II
to make peace without territorial gains. Moreover to the political
arguments in favour of opposition to Russia in the Near East — that
it was necessary to maintain the balance of power in Europe, or
to maintain good relations with Prussia, or to support British prestige —was now being added an economic one. Poland, suitably strengthened, it was contended, might replace Russia to a large extent in the traditional pattern of British trade: above all she might become an important source of supply for the all-important naval stores for which Britain had hitherto relied so heavily on Russia. By the summer of 1790 these commercial schemes had become the pivot on which much ofBritain’s foreign policy turned. The growing hostility in British ruling circles to the further expansion of Russia rose to a climax early in 1791 over the question of Ochakov. This fortress, captured by a Russian army in the autumn of 1788 after a long siege, was believed to command the estuaries of both the Bug and the Dniester. In Russian hands, therefore, it could be used to block the growth of Polish trade down these rivers to the Black Sea and the Mediterranean, and hence the strengthening of Poland which now seemed so desirable in London. Worse still it might allow France, after her commercial agreement with Russia in 1787, to draw large supplies of naval stores from the Ukraine and parts of Poland. It would also strengthen Russia’s position in the Black Sea and increase her ability to dominate the tottering Ottoman Empire. For all these reasons (and they were very inadequate ones) the British government was determined that Russia should surrender Ochakov when peace was made. The pre-war position in the Black Sea littoral must be re-established. This demand Catherine II totally refused. She saw quite well that large territorial gains at the expense of the Turks were now out of the question; but she insisted on some compensation for the losses which Russia had suffered during the war, and Ochakov was to be that compensation. She was willing, in technical terms, to accept the the status quo limité as the basis of a peace settlement, but not the status quo stricte which Britain, with Prussian support, was demanding. By the beginning of 1791, determined not to give way, she was making preparations to meet possible attacks from Prussia or Poland and to strike at Britain’s commerce through organised privateering in case of war. On 11 March 1791 Frederick William II, under the influence of the aggressive spirit which had once more gained the upper hand in Berlin, brought matters to a head. In a rescript to Redern, the
Prussian minister in London, he urged that Britain and Prussia
18


THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE 1791
should force Russia, by the threat of naval and military action, to make peace by the surrender of Ochakov. ‘As the decisive moment is now approaching,’ he wrote, ‘I await a categorical declaration on this subject at the earliest possible moment.’ This proposal hardly deserved to be taken very seriously. Prussian policy was now the plaything of competing factions and individuals — Hertzberg, General Mollendorff, Colonel Bischoffswerder, Countess Dénhoff (the king’s mistress) — and it was unlikely that the government in Berlin would adhere consistently to any line of action. Few people in Prussia really cared much about the Turks, and almost as few were likely to welcome the strengthening of Poland which might follow the defeat of Russia. Moreover the international situation as a whole was not favourable to such a war. Gustavus III, now that he had made peace with Russia, could hardly allow his ports to be used as bases for an attack on her; and inability to use Swedish ports, as Whitworth, the British ambassador in St. Petersburg, several times pointed out, would greatly hamper the British fleet in any operations in the Baltic. In Poland factional divisions and fear of her great neighbour meant that there was no general enthusiasm for war with Russia. No effective interference need be feared from France, temporarily prostrated by the Revolution, but equally there was no effective support to be expected from the Danes or the Dutch. Yet by the end of March Pitt had sent off to St. Petersburg an ultimatum demanding that Catherine IT declare, within ten days, her readiness to make peace on reasonable terms. Simultaneously he asked the House of Commons for ‘some further augmentation’ of the fleet with a view to possible action against Russia. It was immediately clear that he had completely miscalculated the state of public opinion. Political rivals anxious to seize any stick with which to beat the ministers in power, commercial and industrial interests alarmed by the possible loss of the valuable Russian trade, many ordinary citizens bewildered by the prospect of war over a distant fortress of which they had scarcely heard, all united against the government. In Parliament Pitt had to struggle against the obvious hostility to his policy of most of the more vocal members. Even within the cabinet some of his colleagues, notably Lord Grenville, the very able Home Secretary, failed to support the line he had taken. Most press and pamphlet opinion was against him.1 The result was that as early as 6 April he had to admit that there was ‘little or no chance of pushing our Plan to its original extent’.”

1791-2 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
By the beginning of May the idea of sending a British squadron to
either the Black Sea or the Baltic had been abandoned and a special
envoy, William Fawkener, was on his way to the Russian capital to
smooth things over with as little loss of face as possible. By the end
of July the British and Prussian ambassadors in St. Petersburg had
agreed to the annexation by Russia of the Black Sea coastline
between the Bug and the Dniester, provided the navigation of the latter were not interfered with. A few days later, when a RussoTurkish armistice was concluded at Galatz, the Porte agreed in principle that the Dniester should henceforth mark the frontier between the two states. The treaty of Jassy, which was signed on g January 1792 after protracted negotiations, confirmed this and therefore gave Ochakov definitively to Russia. It also confirmed all existing agreements between Russia and Turkey (and hence Russian possession of the Crimea) and made the Porte responsible for ending raids into Russian territory by the Circassian tribes living south of the Kuban river. The gains made by Russia in the war of 1787-92 were not large in proportion to the length and cost of the struggle. Nor did her army, though it put up a better performance than that of the Habsburgs, do much to enhance its reputation. Properly led and organised, the Russian and Austrian forces might well have compelled the Turks to make peace in the first year of the war. It was their failure to do so which, by allowing Britain and Prussia to influence events, made possible the complex European crisis, or rather series of crises, of 1788-91. Yet the war had results in many ways comparable in importance to those of the earlier struggle of 1768-74. Russia was now more clearly marked than ever as the most formidable enemy of the Ottoman Empire. Her government had shown much greater tenacity in the struggle with the Turks than that in Vienna. Her army, though for the most part poorly led, had won more, and more important, victories than that of the Habsburgs. Her territorial gains, though relatively small, marked a real step forward in the growth of her power in the Black Sea littoral; Austria had failed even to regain the Balkan frontiers which she had briefly achieved by the treaty of Passarowitz in 1718. The eighteenth century had seen
a positive contraction of Habsburg power in the Near East which
contrasted strikingly with the growth of Russian influence there.
Already there was developing that Austro—Russian competition to
lead and control the Balkan peoples which was often to be a
significant factor in the nineteenth-century politics of the area.

The war had also shown up the complete inability of France, at least for the time being, to play any positive role in Near Eastern affairs. Even in 1787 her internal difficulties had forced her government to adopt a cautious and temporising policy. By 1791—2 she had no Near Eastern policy worthy of the name and her political influence in the Levant, declining for a generation, had collapsed. In the nature of things this collapse was likely to be short-lived; but in future it would be more and more difficult for France to remain the only west-European power with serious political interests in the area. The crisis of 1788-91 had temporarily brought Prussia and, above all, Great Britain into closer contact with its problems than ever before. To see the ‘Ochakov Crisis’ of 1791 as marking the beginning of consistent British opposition to Russian ambitions in the Near East, or as foreshadowing the policies later to be followed there by Palmerston and Disraeli, is to exaggerate and misunderstand its significance. It was a short-lived episode; for by mid-May 1791, when it was clear that no Anglo—Russian war would take place, popular interest in Britain in Near Eastern questions had once more dropped to a very low level. It was also a somewhat mysterious one; for common sense as well as tradition and expediency were against the usually commonsensical Pitt and his policy. If Britain ever had serious reason to fear the expansion of Russian power in the Near East it was not in 1791. Nevertheless the crisis of that year saw the sharpest collision between Britain and Russia since the 1720s. It marked a stage in the slow growth in Britain of a widespread distrust of Russia and her ambitions; and this distrust, strengthened by the experience of the next generation, had by the 1830s become the most important single element in Britain’s attitude to Near Eastern affairs. It also marked, in the scornful comments on the Turks of Pitt’s opponents, the beginning of that widespread cynicism about the Ottoman Empire, its justification and prospects of survival, which was to influence British opinion deeply on occasion during the nineteenth century. By 1792, when the war with Russia ended, the Ottoman Empire was beginning to be affected, in a limited but important way, by the French Revolution. The Reformation, the ‘Scientific Revolution’ of the seventeenth century, the Enlightenment of the eighteenth century —none of these had any effect on Turkey. The French Revolution had such an effect mainly because of its secularism, because it was “the

first great social upheaval in Europe to find expression in purely non-religious terms’.1 This made it reconcilable with Islam and therefore acceptable to at least a few educated and forward-looking Turks, as none of the great social and intellectual upheavals in the previous history of Europe had been. Quite apart from this, however, the way had already been prepared to some extent in Turkey, or at least in Constantinople, for many of the ideas of the revolutionaries. French efforts in the 1770s and 1780s to strengthen the Turkish army and navy for more effective resistance to Russia had led to the founding, in 1773, of a school of mathematics for naval officers, while the press attached to the French embassy had printed a number of technical works by French. officers on fortification and naval tactics. A very few adventurous Turks had been able to visit France and acquire some first-hand knowledge of the greatest centre of European civilisation. The immediate effects of all this were very limited. Even in the 1790s leading Turks, with few exceptions, continued to suffer from the ludicrous ignorance of Europe which had for so long aroused the derision of western observers.” Moreover there were already signs that the ‘enlightened’ ideas spread by the revolution, while they might do something to strengthen the central government of the Ottoman Empire, would certainly stimulate in some of its European provinces dangerous aspirations to a greater degree of autonomy if not to actual independence. This development was especially marked in Greece;? but it was also visible in the Danubian Principalities, where in 1791 a group of Wallachian boyars demanded that henceforth only natives of the province should be appointed as Hospodars or allowed to serve in its army. Nevertheless the 1790s saw the first serious attempt to modernise the structure of the empire and above all that of its armed forces. This attempt was inspired by the Sultan himself, the remarkable and ill-fated Selim III. He had been allowed, before his accession in 1787, much more personal liberty than was normally granted to Turkish princes; and for some time before becoming Sultan he had been in correspondence with Louis XVI and had shown a desire to

reform with French help at least certain aspects of Turkish life.! The
war with Russia and Austria prevented his achieving anything for
several years; but as it drew to a close he embarked on an ambitious scheme of reforms, particularly in the Turkish army, the field in which improvement seemed most needed. (Efforts to reform the Turkish fighting forces had begun under Abdul Hamid I in the later 1780s; but these were unsystematic and ineffective.) In 1791 a special envoy, Ratib-Effendi, was sent to Vienna to report on military and administrative organisation in Austria and other European states. In 1792~3 a stream of new regulations attempted to reform the provincial governorships and taxation system and above all to create a new corps of disciplined infantry on European lines. In 1791-9 nearly fifty new men-of-war of differing sizes were launched. New military and naval schools, staffed mainly by Frenchmen, were set up; they became at once, like their predecessors in the 1770s and 1780s, the most important channel through which ‘enlightened’ ideas filtered into the upper ranks of Ottoman society. From 1793 onwards rather unsuccessful efforts were made to establish permanent Turkish embassies in most of the major capitals of Europe — in many ways a more striking break with the Ottoman past even than the military reforms. Selim’s presence on the throne and the fading but still powerful tradition of co-operation between France and Turkey seemed to many Frenchmen in the early 1790s, in a period of increasing French isolation in Europe, to mark out the Ottoman Empire as a state friendly to France. In 1792 two successive French Il'oreign Ministers, Dumouriez and Lebrun—Tondu, were thinking in terms of the revival of the old alliances with Sweden, Poland and the Turks, supported by Prussia, against the Habsburgs and Catherine II. The collapse of the French monarchy and the difficulties caused by the outbreak of war with most of the great powers of Europe in 1792-3 meant that the Ottoman Empire was left as the one important state with which France still enjoyed relatively good relations, and in 1795 there began a considerable dissemination of French propaganda in Constantinople which was to last for the next three years. Throughout the period 1792—7 the Turkish attitude to France remained generally friendly; and in March 1797 the French ambassador, General Aubert—Dubayet, proposed a Franco—Turkish

1796-7 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 alliance against Russia and Austria. French expansion seemed no threat to the Ottoman Empire
— rather the reverse through its effect in weakening the Habsburgs. French technicians in considerable numbers continued to instruct the new Turkish army. In 1796 Aubert-Dubayet brought a large number of them to Constantinople and in the previous year a young officer called Bonaparte had offered to reorganise the Turkish artillery. Most important of all, perhaps, a people to whom the deposition and murder of Sultans was a familiar concept could feel none of the horror aroused in many quarters in western Europe by the execution of Louis XVI, while Moslems were unlikely to be shocked by the hostility to organised Christianity of the more extreme revolutionaries. The French annexation of the Ionian Islands in October 1797, as a result of General Bonaparte’s brilliantly successful campaigns against the Habsburgs in north Italy, dealt, however, a sharp blow to Franco-Turkish relations. It was seen in Constantinople as preparing the way for further French expansion in the Levant and for French activity in Greece and Crete; and with reason, for in August Bonaparte, in a despatch to the Directory in Paris, had insisted that Corfu, Zante and Cephalonia were worth more to France than the whole of Italy. This, he argued, was because they provided bases for action in the eastern Mediterranean, either to bolster up the Ottoman Empire or to share in the spoils if it collapsed. He had already opened relations with local notables in Greece and begun to play with the idea of an invasion of Egypt. The alarm of the Porte can perhaps be seen in its suggestion in the summer of 1797 that France should cede the Ionian Islands to Turkey in return for concessions to French trade in the Levant and free entry to the Black Sea for French shipping. An invasion of Egypt was by no means welcome to some at least of the five Directors. J. F. Reubell, the strongest personality among them and the Director who took the greatest personal interest in foreign policy, had already unsuccessfully opposed Bonaparte’s ambitious schemes in Italy. He wished above all to strengthen and secure France’s eastern frontier by establishing it permanently on the Rhine (it is relevant that he himself came from Alsace) and also to recover if possible some of the lost French colonies, notably Louisiana. To realise these ambitions he was quite willing to make concessions elsewhere to France’s enemies. He opposed, therefore, the creation of small Italian vassal-states to which Bonaparte contributed by setting up the Cisalpine Republic in June 1797, arguing with reason that they would be too weak and unstable to
be a source of real strength for France. Bonaparte was able, in the
24


THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE 1797-8
peace-terms which he signed with the Austrians at Leoben on 18
April 1797, to forestall Reubell. By maintaining his conquests in
Italy he sacrificed, at least for the time being, the possibility of
achieving international recognition of the Rhine frontier; and French public opinion forced the Directors to accept the terms he had made. A similar conflict, with a similar outcome, now arose over the Egyptian expedition. For long the Directory had dreamed of disposing of their greatest and most intractable foe by an invasion of the British Isles, schemes for which had been put forward in Paris almost from the outbreak of the war. In 1796 serious preparations had been made for an invasion of Ireland; in 1798 (when there was in fact a small and unsuccessful landing there) there were high hopes that England herself was about to succumb to direct attack. The Directory had even issued government bonds which were to be redeemed by the contributions to be levied in London after its capture. An invasion of England seemed to Bonaparte, however, too risky a stroke. He had inspected at the end of 1797 the naval bases and garrisons on the north coast of France and realised the difficulties involved. Already in August of that year he had written that ‘the time is not distant when we shall realise that to destroy England we must take possession of Egypt’; and on 23 February 1798 he presented to the Directory a mémozre in which he demanded the abandonment of the attack on England and its replacement by one on Egypt or Hanover. Talleyrand, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who was now beginning a close but chequered association with Bonaparte which was to last for the next decade, had already urged an attack on Egypt in a mémoire of 14 February. It could be argued that such an attack would be much easier than one on Britain, since there were no British warships in the eastern Mediterranean and considerable numbers of troops available in southern France to form an expeditionary force. Egypt, because of her own resources and the eastern trade which might be developed by way of the Red Sea, was well worth having from an economic point of view. Moreover if it led to the conclusion of alliances with the semi-independent rulers of Syria, Mesopotamia and Arabia, or with the Shah of Persia, and to the construction of a French naval squadron in the ports of the Red Sea, a French invasion of Egypt might open the way for an attack on British power in India. This, it was believed in London as well as Paris, would have disastrous results for British trade and financial strength. Dreams of eastern empire, of making himself a latter-day Alexander the Great, undoubtedly had considerable influence on Bonaparte; when he sailed to the conquest of Egypt he
carried with him maps of Bengal and the Ganges valley.

1798 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
Reubell strenuously opposed the Egyptian scheme but had the
support of only one other member of the Directory, La Révelliére.
With three of the five directors against him and in face of the personal
prestige of Bonaparte and the glamour of the project, he had to give way. In March 1708 the idea of an invasion of England was replaced by that of an attack on Egypt. On 12 April, a decree (which was not to be published) was issued for the occupation of the country. It justified the French action on the grounds that the Mamluk Beys had ‘formed most intimate ties with the English’ and as a result ‘committed open hostilities and the most horrible cruelties against Frenchmen’. A main object of the attack, it was made clear, was to open communications with India and ‘to combat the satellites of the English government there and stop that source of its corrupting wealth’. Bonaparte was to ‘drive the English from all their Oriental possessions which he can reach’, to cut a canal through the isthmus of Suez and ‘to ensure to the French Republic the free and exclusive possession of the Red Sea’.t On 19 May an armada of transports laden with soldiers and an imposing corps oflinguists, archaeologists, geographers and other scholars, left Toulon and Marseilles with a large naval escort. It was joined a few days later by large contingents from Genoa and Civitavecchia. Seizing Malta en route, almost without resistance, the French disembarked near Alexandria on 1 July. On the gist, with a loss of only 40 killed and wounded, they destroyed the Mamluk army and found themselves in control of the whole of Lower Egypt. It had not been foreseen in Paris that the invasion would lead to serious trouble with the Porte. The French legation in Constantinople, then in the hands of the chargé d’affaires, Ruffin, was informed of the projected attack only on 12 May. Not until August did Talleyrand explain the French attitude in detail. The expedition, he wrote in despatches of the 3rd and 15th, was intended to secure redress for the oppression and exactions which French merchants in the Levant had so long suffered at the hands of subordinates whom the Porte was impotent to control. It was not an act hostile to the . Ottoman Empire, for Egypt had for long been defacto independent of Turkish rule. Indeed by destroying the power of the Mamluks France was doing the Turks a service, while the Moslem religion would be scrupulously respected. In his despatch of 15 August, he suggested that Egypt might continue to be governed in the Sultan’s name and that the French, once in possession of it, might make a considerable annual payment to Constantinople. But all military

power there must be entirely in French hands and no European traders were to be admitted to the country without the consent of the French authorities.1 Talleyrand thought these arguments convincing. He even proposed to go in person on a special mission to Constantinople to explain them to the Porte, but drew back at the last momentpossibly because he was needed in Paris to deal with the strained and complicated state of Franco—American relations. In fact his justifications of France’s action cut no ice whatever in the Turkish capital. As early as 19 June the Reis-Effendi made it clear to Ruffin that the Porte was very seriously worried by events in Egypt. The French conquest had deprived Constantinople, at least temporarily, of one of its main sources of food; by the beginning of August the prices of rice and coffee had doubled in the Turkish capital. Popular emotion, rising to hysteria under the influence of economic privations and religious fanaticism, was rapidly driving the Turkish ministers into opposition to France. When towards the end of August news arrived of the annihilation of the French fleet by Nelson at the battle of the Nile French influence at Constantinople virtually ceased to exist. Izzet Mohammed Pasha, the Grand Vizier, and also the Sheikh ul-Islam, were arrested and exiled on the night of 30 August because of their alleged French sympathies. On 2 September Ruffin was sent to the Seven Towers. A formal declaration of war by the Porte followed a week later. For the first time for generations France and the Ottoman Empire were open and declared enemies. For the first time since the thirteenth century a powerful west-European army had landed in the Levant. A new epoch had opened in the history of the Near East.

CHAPTER TWO
The Napoleonic Wars and the Growth

1798-1621
Tue battle of the Nile cut Bonaparte’s communications with France and isolated him in Egypt. It was quite clear that the inefficient and disorganised fighting forces of the Ottoman Empire were unable by themselves to expel the French from the country. As yet Selim’s army reforms, in the face of entrenched conservatism, had had little practical result. It was also clear, however, that the British government intended to do its utmost to prevent the growth of French power in the Near East. In particular it was alarmed by the danger that Bonaparte, once established in Egypt, might co-operate with the strongly anti-British ruler of Mysore, Tipt Sultan, who had for long been a thorn in the side of the British East India Company.+ In the spring of 1799, therefore, a British squadron began to cruise off the southern entrance to the Red Sea in order to cut French communications with India, though by that time Bonaparte had abandoned any idea he may have had of striking at Britain’s possessions there and had instead embarked on a pointless invasion of Syria. Simultaneously the activity of French agents in Persia stimulated the first active British political interest in that country; in August 1799 a British representative, John Malcolm, was sent to Tehran from India. Britain’s political and strategic interests thus demanded the closest possible co-operation with the Turks against the French. At the end of July 1798 the British minister in Constantinople, Spencer Smith, drew up at the suggestion of the Reis-Effendi a project for an Anglo—Turkish alliance, while early in December a number of British officers were sent to the Levant in an effort to strengthen the Turkish army.
? He had already twice suggested, in 1786 and 1797, the sending of a French expedition to help him against the British, and had offered to provide supplies and money for it.
28


THE NAPOLEONIC WARS 1798-1801
The Porte was also able to call upon Russian help. Ever since the Habsburgs had been forced to make peace with revolutionary France at Gampo-Formio in October 1797 the Russian government had been urging the Turks to co-operate in the struggle against the revolution. Hitherto the Porte had paid little attention; but the French invasion of Egypt completely altered the position. In September 1798 a Russian squadron passed through the Straits, enthusiastically greeted by large crowds at Constantinople, to act with the Turkish fleet against the French in the Mediterranean. A formal alliance between Russia and Turkey was signed on 3 January 1799. Britain at once adhered to it and by a treaty of 5 January, which was to last for eight years, guaranteed the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. The most important provision of the RussoTurkish treaty was that which gave Russian warships (in a secret clause) the right of passage through the Straits for the duration of the war. In spite of this unprecedented concession, however, the Turkish government retained full sovereignty over the Straits and sole responsibility for their defence; moreover it was specifically provided that no warships other than those of Russia and Turkey should enter the Black Sea. These alliances bore very substantial fruit in a military sense the expulsion of the French from the Ionian Islands early in 1799 by a Russo—Turkish force; the defeat, partly because of the support given to the Turkish garrison by a small British squadron under Sir Sydney Smith, of Bonaparte’s attempt to capture Acre in March-May 1799; and the resulting collapse of his invasion of Syria. These victories more than compensated for the humiliating failure in July 1799 of a Turkish expedition to Egypt which was annihilated by Bonaparte at the battle of Aboukir, and for the defeat at Heliopolis in March 1800 of an Anglo—Turkish force by the French General Kléber. Though he achieved remarkable things in Egypt, completely reorganising its administration in July 1798—-February 1799 and giving an unprecedented stimulus to knowledge of the country and its history, Bonaparte left it on 22 August 1799 a beaten man. He abandoned there an army which had no hope of return to France and which was being steadily decimated by disease. In August 1801 Alexandria fell to a British expeditionary force; the final surrender of the French forces in Egypt, the result of the inertia of their commander, General Menou, and of their own unwillingness to fight, came early in October.

29


1799-1802 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 Yet neither the Anglo-Turkish nor the Russo—Turkish alliance had much real substance. The tendency of the British commanders in Egypt to regard the Mamluk Beys as valuable allies against the French there and to restore their former power antagonised the Porte, which was now determined to re-establish direct Turkish rule over the province. Moreover the Turks failed to obtain the British loan for which they had hoped; and the Convention of El Arish of January 1800, by which the British representatives in Egypt agreed that the French should evacuate the country under very favourable conditions, aroused much resentment in Constantinople. (It was never, in fact, carried out.) More important still, the Russo—Turkish alliance was not, and in the nature of things could not be, cordial. So strong was the traditional fear of Russia in Constantinople that in the autumn of 1799 the Porte was anxious to avoid an immediate French evacuation of Egypt which, it feared, might precipitate a Russian attack on the Ottoman Empire. This fear was accentuated by the failure of its efforts to place the Ionian Islands under Turkish suzerainty. By a convention with Russia of 21 March 1800 it had to agree that henceforth they should form an independent republic. This was to pay tribute to the Porte, and the Ottoman Empire was to have certain rights of protection over the islands; but these rights were to be guaranteed (and therefore by implication limited) by the other powers. The only real gain made by the Turks from the conquest of the islands was that of the unimportant former Venetian territories on the east coast of the Adriatic — Parga, Prevesa, Butrinto and Vonizza; and even these soon fell into the hands of Ali Pasha of Jannina, who had since the end of the 1780s been building up a virtually independent principality covering much of Epirus and Albania and who was subject to no effective control from Constantinople. When the Russian garrison evacuated the Ionian Islands in July 1801 the newly founded republic there collapsed. Cephalonia and Ithaca declared themselves independent, Zante hoisted the British flag and there were serious disorders in Corfu. Early in March 1802 Alexander I of Russia ordered his minister to the Ionian Republic, Count G. D. Mocenigo, to introduce a new constitution which it was hoped would end this division and instability. Five months later a Russian force from southern Italy (where Alexander had been attempting to restore the Bourbon Ferdinand IV to his Neapolitan territories) landed in the islands. Mocenigo then issued a constitution drawn up largely by the Tsar himself which was considerably more liberal than the existing one. The Ionian Republic, still formally independent, was becoming more and more a Russian protectorate, to the deep annoyance of the

Turks.' Moreover events in the Caucasus were now inflaming once
more Turkish fears of the traditional enemy. In September 1795
Tiflis was captured by the Persians. This led in the following year to
the intervention of Russian troops in support of Georgian independence. They left the country in 1797; but the chaos which followed the death of King Irakli in January 1798 led to appeals by the inhabitants for Russian protection against the Moslem conquest which now seemed likely to be their fate. In January 1801 the Tsar Paul proclaimed the annexation of Irakli’s territories to the Russian Empire — the most important territorial gain ever made by Russia in the Caucasus and a serious threat to the positions there of both Turkey and Persia. The formation in 1802 of a federation of the Russian-protected native chieftains of Daghestan (between Georgia and the Caspian coast) and the annexation of Imeretia, another little Georgian principality, in 1804, showed that Russia’s apparently irresistible southward expansion was still far from having reached any natural limit. Above all there were powerful forces in Russia, as there continued to be throughout the Napoleonic wars, which argued that the real interests of the country could best be served by expansion in the Near East at the expense of the Ottoman Empire. To them antirevolutionary crusades in western Europe were a quixotic misapplication of the country’s resources and a waste of her opportunities. Count F. V. Rostopchin, who was in 1799 the Tsar’s chief adviser on questions of foreign policy, strongly favoured a partition of Turkey in co-operation with France. Austria could be compensated for the gains made by the partitioning powers by being allowed to annex Bosnia, Serbia and Wallachia; Prussia might receive compensation in north Germany. The great continental powers, their territorial ambitions thus satisfied, would then combine to oppose the maritime claims and ambitions of Britain.” Paul, infuriated by the selfishness and what seemed to him the treachery of his British and Austrian allies against France, lent a ready ear to such arguments. Early in March 1801 a Russian envoy, Kolychev, arrived in Paris charged with the negotiation of a Franco—Russian peace to be followed by an alliance between the two powers.

in the Near East was a distinct possibility. “he Ottoman Empire cannot exist longer,’ he wrote to Talleyrand on 1 June 1800, ‘and ifPaul I turns his eye in that direction our interests will be the same’ (Howard, op. cit. i. 365).

THE NAPOLEONIC WARS 1801-2
The murder of Paul by a group of discontented courtiers and officials on the night of 23-24 March destroyed for the time being any prospect of Franco—Russian co-operation in the Near East. The most important advisers of his son and successor Alexander I Kochubey, Vorontsov, Prince Czartoryski — were anxious to avoid a partition of the Ottoman Empire since this would face Russia with a powerful France as a neighbour in place of a weak Turkey. Alexander even reduced his forces in the Ionian Islands by the autumn of 1803 to a single frigate in an effort to avoid antagonising France and the Porte by an ostentatious display of Russian power there. He also failed to develop the contacts which his father had made in the later 1790s with the Montenegrins, to whom Paul had promised a subsidy. But the persistence of anti-Turkish traditions and prejudices in St. Petersburg, as of anti-Russian ones in Constantinople, meant that in both capitals the alliance of 1799 was regarded merely as an expedient. Temporarily brought together by mutual fear and dislike of France, the two powers moved apart as soon as the French danger receded. Alexander did not break off the negotiations with Bonaparte which his father had set in motion, and a Russo—French peace treaty was signed on 8 October 1801. An Anglo—French peace followed at Amiens on 23 May 1802. When the Porte in its turn made peace with France, also at Amiens, in June, it received no Russian and little British support in the negotiations. It had therefore to agree to the admission of French merchantmen to the Black Sea, from which they had hitherto been excluded; apart from this the FrancoTurkish treaty virtually restored the position of 1798. The RussoTurkish alliance of 1799 had ceased to exist; and the efforts of the Russian government to prevent rapid changes of Hospodar in the Principalities and to secure the exemption of Wallachia from taxation for a period of years were now creating serious new Russo—Turkish friction. The hostility which separated the two states was far too deep-rooted to be overcome by a year or two of enforced and halfhearted co-operation. The Near Eastern ambitions of the First Consul (as Bonaparte had become after the coup d’état of Brumaire in November 1799) were far from being quenched by the Egyptian fiasco. The FrancoTurkish peace treaty stimulated in Paris and Marseilles hopes of a rapid growth of French trade with the Black Sea. The newlyappointed French ambassador to the Porte, General Brune, who reached Constantinople in December 1802, had instructions not merely to protect French commerce in the Ottoman Empire but to take its Catholic subjects under his protection and expand French
33

influence in every possible way. In the autumn of that year another
French general, S¢bastiani, had already paida visit to Egypt and Syria
to explore the position there and try to make politically useful contacts
with local leaders. His report on his mission, published on 30 January
1803 in the Moniteur, the official organ of the French government, said
amongst other things that a mere 6,000 Frenchmen would be enough
to reconquer Egypt — a claim which did much to stimulate British
fears of further aggression by Bonaparte in the Near East. In Sep
tember 1803 the latter even attempted, through the French consuls in Aleppo and Baghdad, to open relations with the Wahabis" in Arabia. This menacing French activity in the Levant played only a minor role in the resumption of hostilities between France and Great Britain in May 1803. The new Anglo-French struggle was produced by Bonaparte’s refusal to evacuate the Netherlands, Switzerland and parts of Italy, and by the insistence of the British government on retaining Malta for the time being as some counterbalance to these huge French gains. On Franco—Russian relations, however, the repercussions of possible French aggression in the Levant were important. Alexander I had not been particularly anti-French in the first two years of his reign; in some ways his grievances against Great Britain, particularly over her refusal to evacuate Malta, were as serious as those he felt against France, and he would not have been sorry to see Bonaparte retain Egypt. By the early months of 1803 this position was clearly changing. Italinskii, the Russian minister at Constantinople, was now sending home a stream of disturbing reports on the increasing activity of French agents in the Balkans and the landing of French arms in the Morea for use in a Greek rising against the Turks. In February, and again in May, the Tsar urged the British government not to give up Malta, which in British hands would be a serious obstacle to French action in the eastern Mediterranean. At the end of June he offered to garrison the island with Russian troops until its fate could be decided. By the end of the year, as Russo—French relations deteriorated (Morkov, the Russian
ambassador in Paris, was recalled in December at Bonaparte’s
request) there were fears in St. Petersburg that unless Russia acted
to safeguard her interests in the Near East France might very soon
overrun the Ottoman Empire, threatening Russia’s Black Sea trade
and even her southern provinces. The result was a strengthening of
Russian forces in the Ionian Islands (there were 11,000 Russian
soldiers there by the autumn of 1804) and the establishment in

March 1804 of Russian consuls in Salonika, Euboea, Arta and Prevesa, since it was above all in Greece that the growth of French influence seemed menacing. Efforts were also made to reassert Russian dominance in Montenegro, whose ruler placed himself in August 1804 under Russian protection after beheading his pro-French adviser, the Abbé Dolci. Above all there was now in St. Petersburg a desire for co-operation with Great Britain much stronger than any hitherto seen during the wars against the French Revolution; and this was strengthened by the growing influence in the Russian capital of Prince Adam Czartoryski, the Polish nobleman and personal friend of the Tsar who became Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs in January 1804. There were still many sources of friction to divide the two states. Czartoryski’s desire to support Greek aspirations to independence, though it was not shared by Alexander, aroused suspicions in London that Russia really aimed at extending her influence in the Balkans and perhaps even at a partition of the Ottoman Empire. There were, on the other hand, suspicions in Russia that Britain might evade her fair share of the military burden in a joint struggle with France in the Mediterranean, and that she was not as determined as she should be to expel the French from Naples (one of the fundamental objectives of Russian policy). This Russian distrust was largely justified. Throughout the Napoleonic period successive British governments, quite rightly, refused to make any major military effort in the Mediterranean, arguing that transport problems made such an effort immensely difficult and that the British army could best help to defeat France by threatening the coasts of western Europe. Nevertheless mutual fear of France was strong enough, for the time being, to push these suspicions and grievances into the background in both London and St. Petersburg. On 11 April 1805, after long negotiations in London, an Anglo—Russian alliance was signed. It was not the product of the situation in the Near East; it aimed at nothing less than the reduction of France to a position in which she would no longer be a threat to the whole of Europe, and at the redrawing of European frontiers to ensure future peace and stability.” Nevertheless the position in the
1 The impossibility of reconciling sympathy for Greek ambitions and the desire for influence in Greece with the needs of the struggle against France placed the Russian government in a dilemma from which there was no real escape. See Czartoryski’s letter to Alexander I of 29 February 1804 in Sbornik, Ixxvii. 492-3. 2 It provided for the payment by Great Britain to Russia of a subsidy of £1} million per annum for every hundred thousand men the latter put in the field against France; for the union of the northern and southern Netherlands to form a barrier against future French expansion to the north-east; for the acquisition by Prussia of important territories west of the Rhine and for efforts to persuade the French to accept the return of the monarchy after the defeat of Bonaparte.

1805-6 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 eastern Mediterranean played some part, particularly on the Russian
side, in bringing the alliance into existence; and the Anglo—Russian combination, insecure though it proved to be, was to have an important influence on events in the Levant. Five months later, by a treaty of 23 September 1805, Russia and Turkey agreed to cooperate in case of attack on either by a third party. Russia was to occupy the Ionian Islands and guarantee their integrity, while the Porte agreed to allow Russian warships to pass through the Straits as long as the war with France lasted. The alliance of 1799 seemed to have been resurrected. The anti-French combination of 1805 proved less successful and shorter-lived even than that of six years earlier. The Russian government had a considerable squadron under Admiral D. N. Senyavin in the Mediterranean when it declared war on France in October, and 19,000 Russian soldiers landed at Naples in November. Nevertheless it was quite unable to prevent the overrunning of southern Italy by the French a few months later. It was not able even to interrupt effectively the communications with Italy of the French forces in Dalmatia after Austria had surrendered that province to France by the treaty of Pressburg in December. In St. Petersburg there were fears, voiced particularly by Admiral Chichagov, the Minister of Marine, that Britain aimed at domination of all the coasts of the Mediterranean and at commercial domination at least of the Black Sea coasts of Russia. And inevitably the Russo—Turkish alliance was from the beginning a crumbling facade behind which mutual hostility flourished almost unchecked. In Constantinople the overwhelming victories of the French at Ulm and Austerlitz in the latter part of 1805 made a deep impression. They seemed to show that in allying herself with the anti-French powers the Ottoman Empire had chosen the losing side; and the Porte accordingly refused to ratify the agreement of 23 September with Russia. The French government, realising that its stock was rising in the Turkish capital, did its best to have the use of the Straits forbidden to Russian warships: when in May 1806 Sébastiani was sent as French ambassador to Constantinople his instructions empowered him to hint even at the possible recovery of the Crimea by Turkey after a successful Franco—Turkish war against Russia. By the summer of that year the Emperor Napoleon (as he had been since May 1804) had made alliance with the Porte for the time being one of his main objectives. “The object of my policy all through’, he
wrote to Talleyrand on g June 1806, ‘is to make a triple alliance of

myself, the Porte and Persia, aimed directly or by implication against Russia... .I wish to strengthen and consolidate this great empire [i.e. the Ottoman Empire] and use it, as it is, against Russia.’? The establishment of a French consul in Jannina and agents in Travnik and Scutari seemed to show that a French advance in the Balkans was imminent, while efforts were made to enlist the support of Ali Pasha of Jannina by holding out hopes that he might receive Corfu ifit were taken from the Russians. The threat of French aggression in south-eastern Europe aroused profound alarm in St. Petersburg, particularly since the Ottoman Empire was now internally weaker and more divided than ever before. Local warlords (Ali Pasha of Jannina, Pasvan-Oglu Pasha of Widdin, Mohammed Ali, an Albanian adventurer who was now establishing himself as de facto ruler of Egypt) seemed to threaten it with imminent collapse. In Serbia a revolt against the misrule of the local Janissaries had broken out early in 1804.” Even more serious in some ways, the efforts of Selim III to modernise the army, and particularly his issue of a Hatte-Sherif for this purpose in May 1805, were arousing violent opposition from the Janissaries. The empire seemed less than ever able to defend itself effectively. Early in 1806, therefore, it was decided that Russian forces should be held ready to act in the Principalities if the latter were threatened by Austrian occupation or if the Ottoman Empire were attacked by France. In March the Tsar himself told Italinskii that if the Turks showed any further pro-French tendencies he would occupy Moldavia. This would also be done if the Porte attempted to alter the existing position in the Principalities without previous consultation with Russia. In May there were even tentative Russian proposals to the British government for a partition of the Ottoman Empire Russia to take the Principalities and Great Britain Egypt. This, it was hoped in St. Petersburg, might lead to the creation of a large Russian-protected state covering most of the western Balkans, but these suggestions aroused no response in London. The breakdown of negotiations for a Russo—French peace in the summer of 1806% did nothing to calm Russian fears. Thus when on 24 August, the Porte suddenly deposed the Hospodars of Wallachia and Moldavia, Ypsilantis and Maruzzi, and replaced them by new ones more

1806-7 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
favourable to France, there was an explosion of fear and anger in St. Petersburg. Though the deposed Hospodars were restored under Russian pressure a few weeks later this concession came too late to avert war. On 23 November a Russian army entered the Principalities. Two months earlier the Porte had in effect closed the Straits to Russian warships, though it was not until 16 December that, encouraged by news of the French defeat of Prussia at Jena, it formally declared war. Throughout 1805 and much of 1806 the British government showed a remarkable lack of interest in the Near East. But the growth of Russo—Turkish tension and the probability that Britain’s only important ally against France might be weakened by a new war on her southern frontiers changed the situation completely. From the end of August 1806 onwards Arbuthnot, the British ambassador in Constantinople, was pressing for a demonstration there of Britain’s naval power which would raise her declining prestige at the Porte. This, he argued, would force the Turks to make peace with Russia and throw off the French influence to which they were succumbing. In November the cabinet decided that the ambassador must be supported in this way; and even before this decision had been taken Admiral Collingwood, the commanderin-chief in the Mediterranean, had detached a squadron for the purpose. It achieved nothing. By the time it arrived off the Dardanelles French influence in Constantinople was making Arbuthnot’s position there very difficult. On 29 January 1807, believing that he was about to be arrested and sent to the Seven Towers, he fled from the Turkish capital and took refuge on one of the British warships cruising off the entrance to the Straits. His flight merely strengthened still further the hold which Sébastiani had now established over the Porte. An immediate attack by a powerful British squadron would probably have forced the Dardanelles, which were poorly fortified and weakly garrisoned; and when on 10 February Admiral Duckworth arrived with large reinforcements such an attack became possible. Luck was heavily in favour of the Turks, however. For nine days Duckworth was prevented by contrary winds from entering the Straits. By the end of that time the Turks, helped by French engineers, had much improved and strengthened the fortifications. Arbuthnot, in spite of the doubts of the Admiral, insisted on an attempt to reach Constantinople, since the Porte refused his demands that it should accept British mediation in the war with Russia and remove the French ambassador from the capital. On the 1gth, therefore, the squadron entered the Dardanelles. By the
38


THE NAPOLEONIC WARS 1806-7 evening of the following day it was only eight miles from the Turkish capital. But Duckworth wasted the next three days, when he had a favourable wind, in futile attempts to open negotiations; and from the 23rd to ‘he 28th the winds were once more against him. By the end of that period three hundred guns were in position around Constantinople and the Admiral decided that nothing further could be done. On 3 March the squadron withdrew through the Dardanelles, suffering some loss in the process. Five days later, off the island of ‘Tenedos, it was joined by a considerable Russian one from the Adriatic under Senyavin. (The fact that the Russian arrived just too late to take part in the effort to force the Straits is a good illustration of the lack of effective co-operation which weakened the efforts of France’s opponents throughout the Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars.) Senyavin proposed a renewal of the attempt; but Duckworth, probably wisely, refused and sailed on 13 March for the western Mediterranean. There was now no hope of a quick end to the Russo—Turkish struggle. French influence was more than ever in the ascendant at Constantinople while Britain and the Ottoman Empire were in a state of undeclared war. From the British point of view French dominance of much or even the whole of the Balkans, though highly undesirable, was not quite the acute danger it seemed in St. Petersburg. French control of Egypt, however, was another matter; and 1806 and the early months of 1807 saw a menacing growth of France’s influence there. Mohammed Ali, who had been formally appointed Pasha of Egypt by a reluctant but helpless Sultan in October 1805, was supported by Drovetti, the French consul-general. His opponents, the Mamluk Beys who had misruled the country for so long, were backed by Major Missett, the British agent. As the Pasha strengthened his position from the summer of 1806 onwards (especially after the death of his chief opponent among the Beys, Mohammed EIfi, in January 1807) French influence tended to increase. By the early spring of 1807 action to prevent Egypt becoming a kind of French protectorate seemed essential to the ministers in London. On 14 March a British squadron appeared off Alexandria; three days later the city fell to the army which it landed. The British attack on Egypt, like the Russian entry into the Principalities three months earlier, was essentially defensive in inspiration. In both cases action was produced not by thoughts of conquest for its own sake, but by a desire to keep the area concerned out of the hands of a dangerous enemy — France or Austria in the case of the Principalities, France in that of Egypt. But the British expedition, unlike the Russian invasion
of Moldavia and Wallachia, was a military blunder. As a means of
39


1807 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
putting pressure on the Turks it was almost useless. Egypt had long been virtually independent and was far from Constantinople; British action there was not a threat to the Ottoman Empire in the way that French aggression in Greece or a Russian seizure of the Principalities could be. Moreover the invasion was a diversion of resources from Sicily and southern Italy, a far more important area in the struggle against France, and was too ineptly conducted to have much chance of success. Attempts to capture Rosetta at the end of March and early in April were a failure. The Mamluk Beys did little or nothing to help the British. There were continual disputes between General Fraser, the military commander, and Missett, who wished for political reasons to occupy the whole of the Nile delta though there were clearly not enough troops to do this effectively. Reinforcements arrived at Alexandria at the end of May; but on 14 June Lord Castlereagh, the Secretary of State for War, ordered the abandonment of the expedition and the evacuation of Egypt. These orders were largely the result of a decision in London to seek a settlement with Turkey which would allow Britain to concentrate her Mediterranean forces for action in Italy. From the end of August 1807 onwards a British plenipotentiary, Sir Arthur Paget, negotiated in Constantinople for this purpose; but the Turks had by now decided that the path of safety lay in adherence to France and her apparently invincible Emperor. By the middle of October the negotiations had ended in failure. Before this happened the whole European situation had been revolutionised when, on 7 July, Napoleon and Alexander I came to terms at Tilsit. Many of the most important results of their agreement — the drastic truncation of Prussia, the creation of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw from part of the spoi—lhsad only indirect repercussions on the position in the Near East. Of much greater significance from this point of view were the cession by Russia to France of Cattaro and the Ionian Islands, and still more the promise by Alexander I to evacuate the Principalities on condition that the Porte did not reoccupy them till a Russo—-Turkish peace treaty had been signed. This treaty was to be made through the mediation of Napoleon; if the Turks had not agreed to one within three months France and Russia would together deprive the Ottoman Empire of all its European possessions except Rumelia.! More important still in some ways, Alexander was to offer to mediate a peace between France and Britain, one which must be based on the restitution by the latter of the French colonies captured during the 1 A vaguely defined area covering most of Macedonia and Thrace.

THE NAPOLEONIG WARS 1807-10 war and on the abandonment of her hated ‘maritime rights’. If
Britain refused to end the war on this basis Sweden, Denmark and
Portugal would be forced to join the Continental System and thus make effective the exclusion of British trade from Europe at which Napoleon was now aiming. Events were soon to show how insecure the foundations of the Russo-French alliance really were. But for the time being it completely changed the balance of forces in the Near East. Turkey, which for nearly two years had been courted by France as an ally against Russia, now found herself in danger of being partitioned by France and Russia acting in concert. Russian troops remained in possession of the Principalities; and with French troops now in occupation of Dalmatia and the Ionian Islands Napoleon seemed likely to dominate the whole western half of the Balkans. On the very day on which the treaty of Tilsit was signed General Marmont, the French commander in Dalmatia, was ordered to collect information about the position in Bosnia, Macedonia, Thrace, Albania and Greece, and to estimate the size of the army needed for an invasion of the Balkan peninsula through Cattaro and Corfu. In January 1808 the Republic of Ragusa, under French occupation since May 1806, was formally annexed to France. Real resistance to French power in the area came not from the weak and disorganised government in Constantinople, but rather from Ali Pasha of Jannina, who, disappointed in his hopes of seizing Parga (a small mainland dependency of the Ionian Islands which Napoleon insisted on retaining), became steadily more anti-French in the three years which followed the Tilsit agreement. Late in April 1810 he even offered Britain 20,000 men for the defence of Sicily against French attack, though there is no reason to suppose that the offer was sincere. An equally important result of the events of 1807 was that Britain and Russia, ineffective allies against France for the last decade, were now enemies at least in theory. Britain’s rejection of the proffered mediation of Alexander I, and still more her bombardment of Copenhagen and seizure of the Danish fleet at the beginning of
September 1807, led to the declaration of war against her by Russia
on 31 October. A few weeks later Senyavin’s squadron, on its way
back to Russia as a result of the Tilsit peace terms, was captured by the British in the Tagus. But the Franco—Russian combination of 1807 was undermined
from the start by the irreconcilable ambitions of the two states and
their rulers. Alexander had been fascinated and perhaps dominated
by Napoleon at Tilsit and was bitterly and justifiably disappointed
41


1807-8 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
by the failure of Britain to give him any effective help in the struggle with France in 1806—7. But these emotions were a very unsubstantial basis for a lasting alliance. Almost from the first the Tilsit agreement was weakened by Russian dislike of the resurrection of Poland, though in a mutilated and weakened form, by the creation of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. Moreover Napoleon’s efforts to persuade his ally to apply the Continental System thoroughly and effectively aroused much opposition in Russia, where the incomes of many landowners depended on the trade with Britain in naval stores. The first real breaches in the alliance, however, were made by the conflicting ambitions of the two powers in the Near East. Napoleon and Alexander certainly discussed a possible partition of the Ottoman Empire in the few days of negotiation before the treaty of Tilsit was signed, though almost nothing is known of what was said. Napoleon seems to have wished to avoid any detailed discussion of the question for the time being, since he hoped soon to strengthen his bargaining position by a successful peace with Britain. Moreover Bosnia and Albania, obvious areas for France to obtain in any partition, would be difficult both to conquer and to hold. In November and December 1807 he suggested more than once that Russia should receive the Principalities and in return allow France to remain in occupation of Silesia, which by the terms of the Tilsit agreement she was obliged to return to Prussia; but nothing came of this, largely because it was feared in St. Petersburg that the proposal covered a plan to hand over Silesia to the Grand Duchy of Warsaw. In fact Napoleon had never any clear idea of what he wished to achieve in the Balkans. (The possibility that Austria might share in any partition of the Ottoman Empire and above all the danger that Britain might obtain too large a share of the spoils were complicating factors.) On only one thing was he determinedRussia must not have Constantinople, which he believed, in a naively mystical way, to be one of the keys, perhaps the greatest, to world power. For a time from November 1807 onwards he even thought, or rather dreamed, not merely in terms of dividing the Ottoman Empire with Russia but also of a possible Franco—Russian threat to the British possessions in India. At the beginning of February 1808 he proposed to Alexander I that 50,000 French and Russian troops with token Austrian forces in support should advance

THE NAPOLEONIC WARS 1808-12
overland towards India via Constantinople and Asia Minor. This suggestion was followed by new discussions in St. Petersburg between the Russian Foreign Minister, Count Rumyantsev, and the French ambassador, Caulaincourt, of a possible partition of the Ottoman Empire; but these merely made it clear beyond doubt that France would not give Russia control of the Turkish capital and the Straits. Napoleon also showed how little he trusted his new ally by demanding in these talks that if the Ottoman Empire were partitioned Austria should be allowed to expand to the Aegean and thus form a buffer-state between the newly-acquired Balkan territories of France and Russia. By May he had decided to abandon the Indian expedition, which he had always regarded as a means of frightening the British into making peace and not as a serious effort to conquer territory there, rather than allow Russia to dominate the Straits. In any case France’s increasing commitments in Spain were now making the Indian adventure even more completely impracticable than it had been before. The meeting of Napoleon and Alexander at Erfurt early in October 1808 merely illustrated how deep the gulf between them on many points was now becoming. The convention of 12 October, which was its outcome, stipulated that Britain must be forced to recognise Russia’s possession of the Principalities; but France would intervene in the Russo—Turkish war only if the Porte were backed by Austria or some other power. All the possessions of the Ottoman Empire other than the Principalities were guaranteed; for the time being the idea of a partition had been abandoned. The next three years saw a steady deterioration of FrancoRussian relations, but few of the landmarks in this process were directly connected with the position in the Near East. They were constituted rather by such things as the French annexation in December 1810 of the Duchy of Oldenburg in north-west Germany, whose ruler was the brother-in-law of the Tsar, and the almost simultaneous ukaz which virtually ended Russia’s paper adherence to the Continental System and placed great obstacles in the way of Franco—Russian trade. As antagonism between them grew, each of the two states sought allies against the other. In February 1811 Alexander attempted unsuccessfully to shake the loyalty to Napoleon of the greater Polish nobles by offering them a liberal constitution and the union under his rule, as an autonomous state, of all Poland except the White Russian areas. (Austria was to be compensated for the loss of Galicia by the acquisition of the Principalities.) In the spring of that year and again in January 1812 Napoleon made approaches to the Porte, also without success, for an alliance with
c 43


1807-14 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 Turkey which would allow him to use her as a weapon against Russia in the war which he saw could not be long delayed. The treaty of Tilsit did not weaken the position of Britain in the eastern Mediterranean. At the end of 1808 a British envoy, Sir Robert Adair, negotiated an end to the de facto war with Turkey which had been dragging on for nearly two years. The Porte was forced to come to terms by a threat, which Britain was well able to make good, to blockade Smyrna and the Dardanelles; and on 5 January 1809 the Peace of the Dardanelles was signed. It restored Britain’s commercial position in the Ottoman Empire and provided that only 3°% duties were henceforth to be charged on her exports to Turkey. The British government on its side agreed to the closure of the Straits in peace-time to all non-Turkish ships of war. Of more immediate importance were a number of secret articles. By one of these Britain undertook to send a squadron to the Levant and supply arms for the defence of the Turkish frontiers if the Porte were threatened with French hostility as a result of the treaty. If Britain made peace with Russia, moreover, she was to do her best to secure also a Russo-Turkish peace treaty which would preserve the integrity of Turkish territory. The Russian government was extremely annoyed by the conclusion of an Anglo—Turkish agreement; and with reason, for Adair in the months which followed the signature of the treaty had visions of an Anglo—Austrian—Turkish alliance against France and Russia. He even urged Collingwood to send a British squadron into the Black Sea to support a Turkish attempt to recover the Crimea. Nothing came of these projects, but Britain’s position in the eastern Mediterranean had been considerably eased and simplified by the peace of 1809. In particular the treaty with Turkey helped to make possible the conquest from France of most of the Ionian Islands. Cephalonia, Zante, Ithaca and Cerigo fell to the British almost without resistance in October 1809. Santa Maura was taken early in the following year. Corfu, the most important of the islands and by far the most strongly held by the French (Napoleon told his brother Joseph that it was of greater strategic importance than Sicily), held out until after the allied capture of Paris in April 1814; but its garrison, under close British blockade, was quite unable to attempt any forward movement in the Balkans. Meanwhile the Russo—Turkish war, which had begun in December 1806, was dragging on. It will be remembered that the treaty of Tilsit had provided for the evacuation of the Principalities within three months by Russia; as a result a Russo—Turkish armistice was signed at Slobodzeia on 24 August 1807 in the presence of a representative of Napoleon. By this Russia agreed to evacuate the Princi

THE NAPOLEONIC WARS 1807-8
palities within thirty-five days, while both sides were to nominate plenipotentiaries to discuss peace terms. On a number of very specious pretexts the government in St. Petersburg refused to accept or ratify this agreement, throwing the blame for its refusal on the Russian commander, General Michelson, who had merely obeyed his instructions. Alexander increasingly wished, as the effects on him of the Tilsit meeting waned, to evade its provisions with respect to the Principalities. He was now thinking in terms of their annexation; on 26 September he wrote to Tolstoy, his ambassador in Paris, suggesting that Napoleon should mediate a Russo—Turkish peace which would give them to Russia. This, he argued, would allow the full strength of the Russian army to be turned against Austria should the latter show any signs of hostility to France. He also demanded as the price of peace with the Turks the cession of Bessarabia and important Turkish territories in the Caucasus with the fortresses of Anapa, Sudjuk-Kalé and Poti. It seems clear that his attitude was largely inspired by his new Foreign Minister, Count N. P. Rumyantsev, who believed strongly, as Rostopchin had some years earlier and as many Russians did, that Russia’s future lay in expansion in the Near East and not in useless and expensive intervention in western Europe. If the Russian government had agreed to continued French occupation of Silesia Napoleon would have been willing to accept Russian retention of the Principalities. But a settlement along these lines, as has already been pointed out, was quite unacceptable to Alexander. During the meeting of the two rulers at Erfurt the French Foreign Minister, Champagny, suggested that France might support a Russian annexation of the Principalities, and also of Finland. In return, however, Russia must help France to establish her power in Spain and must promise to do nothing that would make the Turks hostile to France or throw them into the arms of Britain. Rumyantsev thought the proposal too vague and insisted on immediate French recognition of Russia’s annexation of the Principalities. This concession Napoleon’s involvement in Spain forced him to make in a secret article of the convention of 12 October which ended the meeting. Russia’s position on the Danube thus seemed to be growing stronger. She was by 1808 in military occupation of Moldavia and most of Wallachia, from which the Turks could not expel her. (The important fortresses of Rustchuk and Giurgevo on the Danube fell into her hands in October 1810, making her military position still stronger.) She had secured the consent of the most powerful ruler in Europe to her annexation of these principalities. But the Turks, in spite of their military weakness, showed their usual stubbornness
45


1809-12 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
when there was any question of their having to cede territory. Peace
negotiations early in 1809 between the Reis-Effendi and the Russian
commander, Prince Prozorovskii, collapsed because of the refusal
of the former to abandon any Turkish possessions beyond the
Dniester. New negotiations, which dragged on throughout the spring
and summer of 1811, suffered the same fate. Moreover from 1810
onwards the rapid worsening of Russo—French relations made the
position of the Russians more difficult. As the likelihood of a war with France grew, so did the need to come to terms with the Porte, even at the cost of considerable concessions. The result was that in the autumn of 1811 General Kutuzov, the new commander in the Principalities, was ordered to make peace on the basis of a Russian retention of Moldavia and the abandonment of Wallachia to the Turks. In October 1811 Turkish plenipotentiaries arrived at his headquarters at Giurgevo and negotiations began; they were to last for months. The main difficulty was that, whereas the Russians were willing to accept as the frontier the river Sereth and the Sulina branch of the Danube at its mouth (which would give them most of Moldavia), the Turks insisted on the line of the Pruth (which would restore the whole of the Principalities to Turkish suzerainty). As the threat of French attack became more imminent the Russians were less and less in a position to bargain; and early in February 1812 the War Minister, General Barclay de Tolly, urged the Tsar very strongly to make peace with the Porte. This, he argued, might avert a French attack altogether and would clearly put Russia in a much better position to meet one if it took place. It would also tend to weaken Francophil forces in Russian Poland, a point to which he attached considerable importance.! With the fate of Russia in the balance it was impossible to insist on retaining Moldavia. On 17 May 1812, after the negotiations had twice broken down, peace preliminaries were signed. The treaty of Bucharest, of 28 May,
established the frontier on the Pruth and the northernmost (Kilia)
branch of the Danube mouth. This gave most of Bessarabia to
Russia; the Principalities once more fell under Turkish control,
though they were to retain their traditional and somewhat unreal
autonomy. The parts of Serbia which had rebelled in 18042 were
also to be autonomous; but Turkish forces were still to garrison the
fortresses in them. A tedious war had ended in a considerable terri
torial gain for Russia, though one much smaller than had for long
seemed likely. Once more the Ottoman Empire had benefited from

the quarrels of the powers of Christian Europe, though the Sultan, Mahmud II, soon came to feel that the Turkish plenipotentiaries could have obtained better terms! and showed himself very reluctant to execute some of the provisions of the treaty.” With the signature of the treaty of Bucharest the affairs of the Near East drop suddenly into the background of European politics. There they remained for several years. It had been hoped in St. Petersburg that the treaty might lead almost at once to a RussoTurkish alliance against France, but such hopes were completely visionary. There were also grandiose schemes in the summer of 1812 for a Russian advance across the northern Balkans to the Adriatic to link up with the British there and strike at the Tyrol and even Switzerland. At the end of July, however, Admiral Chichagov, the new Russian commander in the Principalities, reluctantly decided that the physical difficulties of such a march, coupled with the problems of co-operating with the British in the Adriatic, made the plan impracticable.? With peace restored between Russia and Turkey, with French power in Dalmatia and the Ionian Islands disintegrating, the Near East was now entering a period of relative tranquillity as far as its external relations were concerned. Its problems occupied only a very secondary place in the minds of the statesmen who met at Vienna in October 1814 to redraw Europe’s frontiers and provide new guarantees of European peace. Those of Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and above all the Saxon—Polish problem, taxed to the full their energies and ingenuity without their seeking new difficulties to struggle with in the Near East. Lord Castlereagh, the chief British representative at Vienna, proposed early in 1815 that the Ottoman Empire should be included in the general treaty guaranteeing the status quo in Europe which he hoped would be a result of the congress. The proposal foundered, however, on the demand of Alexander I that there must first be a final settlement of all frontier questions between Russia and Turkey and on the refusal of Mahmud II to accept the mediation of Britain,
1Two former Dragomans of the Porte (the chief translators employed in the conduct of foreign affairs, who often had great influence on Turkish policy), Prince Demetrios Maruzzi and his brother Panagios, were put to death later in 1812, apparently because of the part they had played in making peace with Russia. Ghalib-Effendi, the main Turkish plenipotentiary at Bucharest, was exiled. See Ps 50: 3 For some account of the preparations made for such an advance see C. G. Lahovary (ed.), Mémoires de Vamiral Paul Tchitchagov (Paris—Bucharest, 1909) , pp. 398-9.

France and Austria for this purpose. (The whole concept of a general guarantee of the settlement was in any case later abandoned.) Nevertheless new forces, almost ignored in the west, were now emerging in the Balkans. They were to influence very powerfully much of the history of nineteenth-century Europe. For the first time a Balkan people subjected for centuries to direct Turkish rule was threatening to achieve autonomy, perhaps even independence. The revolt which broke out in Serbia in February 1804 was not directed against the authority of the Sultan; indeed it was at first favourable to the power of the Porte. It was a movement against the local Janissaries and their oppression of the Christian population of Serbia, which since 1801 had become a genuine reign of terror; and the Janissaries, as has been seen, were the greatest obstacle to effective modernisation of the ramshackle structure of the Ottoman Empire. It was the murder by them in Serbia of over seventy village headmen and elders which set off the revolt, not any action or demand of the government in Constantinople. For a time the Sultan tacitly approved of the movement and negotiated with the rebels, though the weakness of his own position made it impossible for him to meet their demands. Only from the autumn of 1805, when the power of the Janissaries in Serbia had been largely destroyed, did the rising begin to be one against Turkish rule as such. Only in March 1807, after large-scale massacres of Turks in Belgrade, did the breach with the Porte become complete. Nor were the Serbs able to embarrass the Porte by obtaining effective foreign support. Karageorge, the pig-dealer who led the revolt, achieved little by his appeals to St. Petersburg for help. A Serb deputation which arrived in the Russian capital in November 1804 found the government there determined to preserve the Ottoman Empire if possible, though anxious to improve somewhat the appallingly low quality of Turkish administration and thus prevent the growth of French influence in the Balkans. Czartoryskii, then the leading influence in Russian foreign policy, was in favour of Serbia being granted the same autonomous status as the Principalities, for which the deputies asked. But he persisted in regarding Montenegro, in which Russian agents had been intermittently active for a century, as the obvious centre of Russian influence in the Balkans and did not wish to set up a rival to it. Small subsidies, paid mainly through the Russian consul at Jassy, were the only direct help he felt able to give the Serbs. (Though Russian support for them was one of the reasons given by the Porte for its declaration of war at the end of 1806.) A Russo—Serbian agreement of July 1807, which provided for supplies of money and
48


THE NAPOLEONIC WARS 1807-12
arms to the rebels, for the garrisoning of Serb fortresses by the
Russians and for the nomination by the Tsar of a governor and administration for the liberated areas, did little to strengthen Serb resistance to the Turks; and in the Franco—Russian negotiations early in 1808 for a partition of the Ottoman Empire Count Rumyantsev more than once proposed that Serbia be given to an Austrian Archduke. Several of the Russian commanders in the Principalities in the later stages of the Russo—Turkish war Bagration, Kamenskii, Kutusov
— were willing to aid the Serbs with munitions but unable to give them effective military protection. From the other states of Europe the Serbs received no help at all. A letter of August 1809 to Napoleon in which Karageorge urged the Emperor to take them under his protection, and even the offer to him in October of that year of several Serb fortresses, failed to produce any French support. Appeals to Vienna had no more result; though early in 1810 Karageorge offered to cede Belgrade to the Habsburgs in return for Austrian protection. Indirectly, however, the Serb revolt gained strength from the increasing chaos in Constantinople. The violence of the conservative opposition compelled Selim IIT to abandon his effort of 1805 to conscript men for his new western-style regiments. At the end of May 1807 a military revolt led to his deposition; his cousin was proclaimed Sultan as Mustapha IV but in effect the Janissaries and the Sheikh-ul-Islam ruled in Constantinople in so far as anyone did. In the summer of 1808, after much confusion, Bayrakdar Mustapha Pasha of Silistria marched on the capital hoping to restore Selim. The latter was at once murdered on the orders of Mustapha IV, who was himself then deposed and succeeded by his brother Mahmud II. Bayrakdar Mustapha, the power behind the throne who had embarked upon a remarkable programme of reforms, was in his turn overthrown and killed by yet another Janissary revolt in November. Probably the fact that Mahmud II was the sole surviving male member of the Ottoman dynasty alone prevented his sharing his minister’s fate. But even the appalling confusion and weakness of these years in the Turkish capital, which made many foreign observers believe that the collapse of the Ottoman Empire was at hand, could not give the Serb movement the material strength or the effective foreign support
which it obviously lacked. The treaty of Bucharest allowed the
Turks to divert large forces from the Principalities to Serbia (though
Chichagov sent a small body of Russian troops to aid the Serbs and
the Russian government fruitlessly urged the Sultan to come to
49


1813-17 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
terms with them). This, coupled with an effort by Karageorge to create a military-bureaucratic monarchy which tended to weaken local initiative and local resistance to the Turks, explains the collapse of 1813. Early in that year, after a temporary lull, fighting broke out once more. Belgrade quickly fell to the Turks; in October Karageorge took refuge in Hungary. The collapse was merely temporary, however. Milosh Obrenovich, a new leader and a more intelligent one than Karageorge, again raised the standard of revolt on Palm Sunday 1815. Even now the movement was hardly one for independence, for Milosh regarded himself as a ‘Christian Pasha’ and aimed at bringing all Serbs under his control rather than at throwing off Turkish rule completely. By the end of the year it had been agreed that power in Serbia should in effect be shared between him and a Turkish pasha in Belgrade, though he had to promise to pay an annual tribute to the Porte and to admit Turkish garrisons to the main Serbian towns. In 1817 he allowed his adherents to murder Karageorge, who had returned to Serbia, and thus began a bitter feud between the Obrenovich and Karageorgevich families which was to last for over eighty years. He also succeeded in November of that year in calling an assembly of notables which elected him as hereditary prince. By 1817, then, a Serb state, though as yet a very weak and primitive one, was very slowly emerging. The Serbs, a backward peasant people without a culture in any high sense (both Karageorge and Obrenovich were illiterate), could not by themselves be a serious threat to Turkish power; and as has been seen they received little help from the great states of Europe. In Greece the position was very different. The Greek revolt of 1821 had far deeper roots and was far more deliberately prepared than that in Serbia. Moreover it was a much more radical movement; from the beginning most of the Greek leaders aimed at independence and the nature of Greek society gave the revolt a complexity which the Serbian movement did not possess. The later decades of the eighteenth century saw a remarkable development of Greek seaborne trade, a striking growth of some of the Greek cities such as Salonika and the strengthening of the Greek merchant class in general. From the treaty of KutchukKainardji onwards Greek ships sailing under the Russian flag played a large part in the trade of the Black Sea, while the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars created great opportunities for Greek traders and shipowners in the Mediterranean. The existing Greek merchant colonies in Marseilles, Leghorn, Trieste and other ports became larger; new ones were founded, above all in the rapidlydeveloping grain port of Odessa. Through these colonies; through

In 1814 the Philiké Hetairia, a secret society dedicated to the construction of a large Greek-dominated state modelled on the Byzantine Empire, was founded at Odessa by three members of the Greek merchant-colony there. Within a few years it had become very influential, with members in all the main Greek commercial centres and considerable amounts of money at its disposal. (Though factional and local rivalries between different groups of its members had already begun to show themselves; in particular the higher clergy and the Phanariot Greeks? were becoming distrustful of the political radicalism of much of the society’s membership.) It soon began to dream of the liberation of the whole of the Balkans from Turkish rule; but the murder of Karageorge, who had been initiated as a member in May 1817 shortly before his death, dealt a great
blow to such ideas. From 1818 onwards the society’s activities were
concentrated on Greece and the Greek colonies in Italy, Egypt and

1816-21 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 Russia, though intermittent negotiations with Milosh Obrenovich went on in r81g—-21.4 The Greeks had far better chances than the Serbs of outside support, particularly from Russia. John Capodistrias, a Greek sympathetic to the plight of the Balkan Christians as a whole,” was one of the most important subordinates of Alexander I (from early in 1816 he acted as joint Foreign Minister with Count Nesselrode) and in 1817 he was invited to become the head of the Philzké Hetairia. His refusal to lead a revolutionary organisation did little to reduce Greek hopes of Russian protection. The headship of the organisation was assumed in 1820 by Alexander Ypsilantis, a member of one of the greatest Phanariot families and himself a general in the Russian army; while Russian support for educational work in Greece seems to have been used by some of the leaders of the Hetairia to convince their followers that military help from Russia could be relied on in a rising against the Porte. Such a rising had been planned for 1825. In fact it broke out in March 1821. In that month Ypsilantis crossed the Pruth with a small force and invaded the Principalities in the hope of stimulating there a rising against Turkish rule. This precipitate action was forced on him against his better judgement. It was the result partly of the desire of the Hetairist leaders to take advantage of the struggle then raging between the Porte and the rebellious Ali Pasha of Jannina, and partly of their fears that the organisation would be betrayed to the Turks if action were much longer delayed. The invasion of the Principalities was ill-conceived and unsuccessful; but it began a chain of events which were to raise Near Eastern problems to a hitherto unknown pitch of importance in European politics.
1 Ali Pasha of Jannina offered, in his later years, to become a member; but this was no more than a tactical move. 2 In 1816 he proposed to the Tsar that Serbia and the Principalities be united in a confederation as autonomous states under only a loose Turkish suzerainty (Sbornik, iii. 210-11). On his relations with the Greeks see C. W. Crawley, ‘John Capodistrias and the Greeks before 1821’, Cambridge Historical Journal, xiii (1957), pp. 162-82.

Y PSILANTIS’s invasion of the Principalities had no chance of success. His army was small (only about 3,000 men when he advanced on Bucharest in March 1821) and a battalion of Greek students was the only disciplined force at his disposal. He failed to obtain the co-operation of Milosh Obrenovich, to whom, early in 1821, he had proposed an offensive and defensive alliance. He failed to gain the support of the peasants of the Principalities, which he might have done by promising them emancipation from their masters. More serious, he failed to co-operate with Tudor Vladimirescu, a Wallachian of peasant birth but minor boyar education, who, with some Hetairist backing, had raised a popular revolt against the oppressive rule of the Hospodars and the great landowners. Vladimirescu’s negotiations with the Turks (he hoped to make himself ruler of an autonomous Wallachia as Obrenovich already was of Serbia) ended in his execution on Ypsilantis’s orders during the night of 26-27 May. Above all, whatever hopes the Hetairists may have placed in Russia proved totally unfounded. Alexander I, when he received news of the invasion of Moldavia, deprived Ypsilantis of his commission in the Russian army and refused his appeals for help. He freely gave the Turks permission to send an army into the Principalities to restore order there. On 7 June Ypsilantis and his followers were totally defeated by this force at Dragatsani. He himself took refuge in Austrian territory and spent the next seven years in an Austrian prison. Within a few weeks the remnant of his followers had been driven from the Principalities; and the collapse of the invasion meant the collapse of the now discredited Hetairia Philiké, which
lingered on for only a few months as an organised body.
But already a new movement, a genuinely popular though very
badly organised Greek revolt, was taking shape hundreds of miles to
53


1821-2 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
the south. Conditions in the Morea were very favourable to a
rebellion against Turkish rule. The peninsula had for generations
enjoyed a large measure of primitive self-government; and the
proportion of Turks in its population was small. As long as the
Greeks, with their large merchant marine and reserve of sailors, could control the sea, it was very difficult of access for Turkish armies. The Sultan and his ruling favourite, Halet-Effendi, were in any case preoccupied with the struggle against Ali Pasha of Jannina, who was now besieged by a large Turkish force in his last remaining stronghold; it was unlikely that they would react quickly to events in the Morea. The idea of revolt was not altogether welcome to the local notables and churchmen, who would have preferred to have some guarantee of foreign intervention; but the movement which broke out in the peninsula at the end of March was from the first under their control. It was a national and above all a religious revolt, and a purely Greek one. Though stimulated by Hetairist propaganda it owed nothing to the dreams of Balkan union or federation which had attracted so many Hetairist leaders. The proclamations issued by the rebels spoke entirely of Greece and not at all of the other Balkan nationalities. During the war for independence the Greeks fought for and by themselves. They had no relations of any significance with the Serbs or Rumanians, still less with the subjugated and half-forgotten Bulgarians. At first the rebellion achieved rapid success. It spread in April 1821 to the Greek islands (an essential condition of its survival). By the end of the year the Turks held nothing in the Morea save a few besieged fortresses, while the rebels already controlled a good deal of territory north of the isthmus of Corinth. Nor was there much sign in the first months of the revolt that the Turks were likely to resist it effectively. When news of Ypsilantis’s invasion of the Principalities was received in Constantinople all Greeks in the empire were ordered to surrender any arms they possessed. At the end of March Mahmud II issued a firman calling on all true believers to rally to the support of Islam, and soon afterwards Moslem mobs attacked the Greek quarters of Smyrna and other cities of Asia Minor. These attacks, which were more than equalled in ferocity by Greek massacres of Turks in the Morea, culminated in the hanging of the Greek Patriarch Gregory in Constantinople towards the end of April. A year later, in April 1822, an appalling slaughter of over 20,000 Greeks in Chios, the wealthiest island of the Aegean, shocked Europe. But all this could not hide the fact that much of the Greekspeaking part of his empire had slipped from the Sultan’s grasp and
that by himself he could not reconquer it. In the summer of 1822

Athens, Nauplia and Corinth fell once more into Turkish hands;
but by the end of the year the last two had been retaken by the
Greeks. Though Ali Pasha surrendered early in 1822 and was soon
afterwards murdered, Turkish resources continued to be diverted from Greece by a war with Persia in 1821-3 and by a serious Druse rising in Syria in the latter year.1 Above all the Greeks had command of the sea —a factor of the greatest importance since the main centres of Greek population were all on islands or on the coasts and since land communications everywhere in the Balkans were so bad. But the Greeks could not take full advantage of their favourable position. Almost from the outbreak of the revolt they were deeply divided. Highly educated professional men and intellectuals, most of whom had spent much of their lives outside the Ottoman Empire, had little in common with the peasants and sailors who had to bear the brunt of the struggle. Relatively wealthy islands, such as Hydra and Spetsa, whose shipping placed them in close contact with the outside world, differed greatly from the poor and isolated Morea. Rival leaders — Alexander Mavrocordatos, a member of one of the great Phanariot families; George Kondouriotis, a wealthy shipowner of Albanian origin who spoke very imperfect Greek; Theodore Kolokotrones, the most important of the mainland leaders — soon emerged and competed violently for power. An ambitious republican constitution was proclaimed at Epidauros in January 1822; but it never existed except on paper.” These factional struggles grew rapidly worse, and by the end of 1823 civil war was raging between Kolokotrones and a would-be government controlled by Mavrocordatos and Kondouriotis. Nothing shows more clearly the weakness of the Ottoman Empire at this period than the failure of the Turks to crush opponents themselves so weak and so divided. Yet fail they did. In 1822 they recovered much of the territory they had lost north of the Gulf of Corinth; but the same year saw a Turkish invasion of the Morea collapse and Athens fall to the rebels. In 1823, in spite of the ending of the Persian war, the Sultan could accomplish little against the Greeks, who recaptured Corinth. By 1824 it was becoming clear to the Porte that it must call for help upon its greatest though perhaps least reliable vassal, Mohammed Ali Pasha, ruler of Egypt. In 1811, by a spectacular massacre in

2 Mavrocordatos had already thought, before the end of 1821, of making
Eugéne de Beauharnais, the stepson of Napoleon, king of Greece. In the following
year another Greek politician, Negris, planned to establish a monarchy under
Jerome Bonaparte, the younger brother of Napoleon. Other schemes of this kind were constantly proposed throughout the revolt.

Cairo of the remaining Mamluk Beys, the Pasha had securely established his regime in Egypt. Since then he had gone from success to success. In 1812—13 he had reconquered the Hedjaz, with the holy cities of Medina and Mecca, from the Wahabis. This conquest had been consolidated when, in 1818, his very able son Ibrahim Pasha captured the Wahabi capital, Darayyah. In 1820 he began the conquest of the Sudan which was completed in 1826. These achievements were made possible by the creation of an efficient army, largely with the help of European, and above all French, officers, while great efforts were made to create a navy by buying or building ships at Genoa, Venice and Marseilles. From early in his reign, moreover, Mohammed Ali had sent young Egyptians to study in Europe and had encouraged the introduction into Egypt of new techniques and useful knowledge. These policies, like his efforts to develop the country’s economic life by a system of state monopolies, had only very moderate success. It is no longer possible to accept the exaggerated estimates of Mohammed Ali’s achievements which have for long been fashionable. He was an ambitious and able military despot, not a great statesman. His destruction of the Mamluks was a benefit to Egypt, as probably was his confiscation of many religious endowments. But his conscription for the army and for forced labour inflicted enormous hardship on the Egyptian peasant, as did the heavy taxes which he imposed. His interest in European culture and ideas was completely utilitarian and quite superficial. The schools he set up were designed merely for the production of officials; and the press which he established at Bulaq in 1822 printed mainly naval and military manuals. His innovations largely destroyed in Egypt a traditional way of life which, though backward and backward-looking, was still a reality. He could put nothing equally stable in its place, for his regime was a personal one dependent for its working on the impetus which he alone provided. ‘In general,’ says a recent Arab writer, ‘it can be said that Muhammad ‘Ali was more successful in tearing down the traditional political, social and economic structures than in building new ones in their place. .. . Most of what survived and endured in his work bore the mark and the defects of having been hastily erected with the single purpose of power expansion in mind.”? But this was hardly visible to the Pasha’s contemporaries in the 1820s. By the beginning of the Greek revolt his real power was

From this they were to be rescued, though in an unplanned and even reluctant way, by the great powers. The outbreak of the Greek revolt, and particularly the massacre of Chios, had stimulated in western Europe a considerable burst of philhellene feeling. Religious sympathy with the struggle of a Christian people against Moslem misrule; political sympathy with the nationalism which the Greeks appeared (in many ways misleadingly) to represent; reverence for classical Greece whose heirs the Greeks of the nineteenth century were often assumed to be —all these forces helped to strengthen this feeling. Philhellene committees sprang into existence in many European cities to collect funds for the Greeks and carry on propaganda on their behalf.1 Public opinion in western Europe, in so far as it can be measured, was strongly favourable to the Greeks. Volunteers from many countries, of whom Byron was the best-known though not the most effective, fought in the Greek forces. In March 1824 a Greek loan of £800,000 was floated on the London moneymarket. The real effect of all this can very easily be exaggerated. The volunteers were sometimes useful, but they were not very numerous and they often tended to become involved in the feuds of the Greek parties and their leaders. The committees were not conspicuously successful in raising money for Greece; up to the end of 1824 the entire Christian world had contributed at most £90,000 in gifts to its cause.? The loan of 1824 had to be issued at little more than half the par value of the bonds, so bad was the credit of the Greek government; and after expenses had been deducted only £315,000 was actually available for use in Greece. By the end of that year there were distinct signs that philhellene feeling was on the wane; in

1821-3 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 particular the London Greek Committee, after a life of little more
than eighteen months, now faded out of existence. Above all the philhellenes could do little to influence effectively the policies of the great powers; and only the great powers could ensure the final victory of the Greeks. But these powers were never united on the Greek question. Alexander I attempted, when the revolt broke out, to establish some co-operation between them. In July 1821 he suggested a RussoFrench alliance, holding out as an inducement to the government of Louis XVIII the prospect of an eventual French protectorate over the Morea. But this suggestion aroused no response in Paris, where it was not taken very seriously; and it was already becoming clear that Britain, France and Austria, the three major states of west and central Europe, were unwilling to do anything effective for the Greeks or to become involved in the rebellion if they could avoid it. Castlereagh, who remained Foreign Secretary until his death in September 1822, had already broken, before the revolt began, with the conservative concert of the great powers established at the end of the Napoleonic wars. He distrusted the claims which its members, or at least Austria and Russia, were now putting forward to a right of interference in the domestic affairs of other states if such interference seemed necessary to maintain European stability. Any international agreement to interfere in Greece, any international guarantee of a settlement there, would create new ties between Britain and the conservative alliance. Such ties he was determined to avoid. Lord Strangford, the British ambassador to the Porte, went even further than this and was so strongly pro-Turkish in his attitude that Castlereagh had to urge moderation upon him. George Canning, Castlereagh’s successor, was as unwilling as he to interfere in Greece. Like Castlereagh, moreover, he regarded the Ottoman Empire as a barrier against the advance of Russian power to the eastern Mediterranean and was unwilling to weaken it. The strength of the Greeks at sea compelled the British government to recognise them as belligerents in March 1823. But this was essentially a tactical move to make it easier to protect British shipping against the attacks of Greek pirates; it meant no weakening of Britain’s neutral attitude in the struggle. Metternich, the Austrian chancellor, was by contrast definitely hostile to the Greeks. To him they were a half-savage people who, by revolting against their legitimate ruler, had opened the way to large-scale Russian interference in the Ottoman Empire. This might well disrupt the hard-won peace and unity of Europe and in particular lead to serious friction between Austria and Russia. ‘In the

last six weeks’, he wrote in his diary on 20 April 1821, ‘we have
ended two wars and stifled two revolutions (i.e. those in Naples and
Piedmont). It is to be hoped that the third revolution which has
broken out in the East will be no more successful.’! He described the
Greek revolt, in a circular despatch of 31 August 1821, as ‘a firebrand
thrown by the radicals between the great powers and especially between Austria and Russia’. His objectives in the Near East were very simple. Outstanding sources of Russo—Turkish friction should be separated from the rebellion in Greece, which should then be crushed by the Turks as quickly as possible. Throughout the early years of the Greek war, then, Austrian influence was thrown wholeheartedly on the Turkish side. In particular Austrian ships were regularly used to transport troops and munitions for the Porte, so that by 1826 over a hundred of them had been captured or sunk by the Greeks. But the key to the situation was Russia. Alone of the great powers she had positive grievances against the Porte, really deep-rooted sentimental ties with the Greeks and the ability to threaten the heart of the Ottoman Empire with military attack. Long before 1821 Russo—Turkish tension had been rising. When Count G. A. Stroganoy arrived in Constantinople in 1816 as Russian minister to the Porte he brought with him instructions to secure the full execution by the Turks of the treaty of Bucharest whose terms, it was claimed in St. Petersburg, had hitherto in several ways been disregarded. He must ensure that the Principalities had full autonomy under Russian protection; their Hospodars, as agreed in the treaty, should hold office for a fixed term of seven years and be eligible for reappointment. Serbia should be placed under Russian protection; if this could not be obtained she should be given as high a degree of autonomy as possible. Turkish forts on the islands of the Danube should be demolished. Turkish claims against Russia in the Caucasus must be given up. The last of these points was the most important and the most controversial. At Bucharest the Russian government had undertaken to abandon all the Caucasian territory it had conquered during the war of 1806-12. But it did not interpret this promise as covering areas which had united
with the Russian Empire more or less voluntarily during the war or before it, as Imeretia, Mingrelia, Abkhazia and Guria had
done. In particular Alexander I and his ministers refused to admit
that they were under any obligation to give up the potentially
valuable Black Sea port of Sukhum. By retaining this and the less

1813-23 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
important one of Redut-Kalé they were able to control 120 miles of
the eastern coastline of the Black Sea. Almost from the moment the
treaty was signed these Caucasian territories became the object of
Russo-Turkish disputes. In 1813-15 the Porte several times demanded that Russia evacuate Mingrelia, Imeretiya and Guriya, while a number of frontier incidents in the area seemed to threaten fresh trouble. Stroganov’s efforts to end these disputes achieved little. His negotiations with the Porte in 1817-18 over the position in the Caucasus broke down; and though in 1820 Nesselrode, who had little interest in the area, proposed the evacuation of Sukhum, a strong protest from General Ermolov, commander-in-chief of Russia’s Caucasian forces, prevented this being carried out.t The outbreak of the Greek revolt therefore found Russia and the Ottoman Empire already on bad terms. It provided at once an important new source of friction between them. The most spectacular development in Russian economic life during the years before 1821 was a very rapid growth in grain exports to western Europe from the recently-settled Black Earth areas of South Russia. This trade, centred on the new port of Odessa, was carried on largely in Greek ships, many of which flew the Turkish flag. The outbreak of the revolt in the Morea led to Turkish action to destroy Greek trade and to prevent such ships passing through the Straits. Moreover in May 1821, and again a year later, the Porte claimed the exercise of its ancient right to preempt for the feeding of Constantinople foreignowned cargoes of foodstuffs passing through the Straits. These claims aroused violent protests from the powers, above all from Russia; and their irritation was increased by the reluctance with which /firmans (written orders) for the passage through the Straits of foreign merchantmen were often issued by the Turkish authorities. The combined effect of these factors was to reduce wheat exports from South Russia from 1,410,000 chetverts in 1819 to 633,000 in 1822; and though they then recovered somewhat they remained far below their pre-war level.? In April 1823 Mahmud II attempted to forbid the use by the Russians of Greek ships sailing under the Russian flag; this provoked another strong Russian protest. To the tangible grievances of Russia against the Ottoman Empire over territory in the Caucasus and trade through the Straits was added the natural sympathy of an Orthodox government and people

for fellow-believers persecuted by Moslems; and in the early 1820s
there were strong military pressures in St. Petersburg in favour of
Russian intervention in the war in favour of the Greeks. Yet Alexander I was determined to avoid such intervention. He was very willing to protest against ill-treatment of Christians and interference with trade (for example in a strongly-worded note to the Porte of 16 June 1821): but military action against the Turks he refused to contemplate. In July 1821 Stroganov, on orders from St. Petersburg, demanded a ‘change of system’ in regard to the Greeks, as well as satisfaction for Russia on the other points at issue between her and the Porte, and left Constantinople when he received no reply. But this was not the prelude to Russo—Turkish hostilities as some observers feared. Indeed in the following year the Tsar showed his desire for peace by dismissing Pini and Pisani, the Russian consulsgeneral at Bucharest and Jassy, because of their philhellene attitude. In August 1822 Capodistrias, distressed by the Tsar’s refusal to intervene against the Turks, left Russian service and settled in Switzerland. Alexander was prevented from acting by his belief that above all the peace and stability of Europe must be preserved. A war with the Porte, however justified, would be in effect a war in defence of rebels against their legitimate ruler. It would fatally weaken the fragile conservative order established in Europe in 1814-15 and allow the forces of disorder and revolution, with their centre in France, to sweep once more over the continent. ‘If we reply to the Turks with war, he told Capodistrias in August 1821, ‘the Paris directing committee will triumph and no government will be left standing. I do not intend to leave a free field to the enemies of order. At all costs means must be found of avoiding war with Turkey.’! While her ruler thought in these terms Russia was not a threat to the Ottoman Empire. Nevertheless Alexander wished to do what he could for the Greeks and was sincerely anxious to co-operate with the other great powers in achieving a Near Eastern settlement. Early in 1822 he proposed to the British and Austrian governments that they should sign with Russia a confidential agreement on the Greek question: both refused for fear of strengthening Russian prestige in the Balkans and because of their unwillingness to antagonise the Turks. In June of the same year the Tsar promised to attend a conference on Near Eastern problems which Castlereagh and Metternich had agreed

1822-4 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 to hold at Vienna in September. It proved quite ineffective, though in a note of 26 September, Nesselrode, the Russian vice-chancellor and Foreign Minister, demanded that the Porte negotiate with the powers for some guarantee of toleration and amnesty for those Greeks who might return to their allegiance. Alternatively Turkey must show ‘by a series of deeds’ that the Orthodox religion would be respected and a just and durable peace re-established in Greece. She must also evacuate the Principalities completely and abandon her restrictions on trade passing through the Straits. Clearly, however, the Russian government, in spite of these strong words, was unwilling to act alone. A year later, after a meeting with Francis IT of Austria at Czernowitz, Alexander agreed to send a Russian representative once more to Constantinople, though he was to handle only commercial affairs. He also agreed to do nothing further on the Greek question without previous consultation with all Russia’s allies. In spite of the Tsar’s conciliatory attitude the powers continued to be deeply suspicious of Russian policy in Greece and the possibility of Russian domination there. In January 1824 the Russian government proposed the establishment of three autonomous Greek principalities with a status similar to that of Moldavia and Wallachia. But this both disappointed the Greeks, who thus saw themselves denied both independence and unity, and aroused the suspicions of the powers, above all Britain, who saw in the scheme (quite unfairly) a mere camouflage for Russian control of Greece. Alexander also proposed to call a conference of the powers in St. Petersburg to discuss a Near Eastern settlement; but Canning would allow Bagot, the British ambassador there, to attend this only if normal diplomatic relations between Russia and the Porte had previously been restored. The fact that in April the Turks had agreed in principle to evacuate the Principalities allowed Alexander to agree to this condition and the conference opened on 17 June. Its first phase, brief and inglorious, lasted for only two meetings, for both the Greeks and the Turks refused to accept the idea of autonomous principalities. Moreover negotiations about the evacuation of Moldavia and Wallachia, which were conducted in Constantinople on Russia’s behalf by Strangford, dragged on till the end of the year. Russian diplomacy had thus been strikingly unsuccessful in 1824 where the Near East was concerned. The Tsar, who blamed Canning for the failure of his January proposal and for that of the conference, had decided by the end of the year to abandon any effort to reach agreement with the British government. On 30 December Nesselrode gave instructions to this effect to Prince Lieven, the Russian ambassador in London.
62


THE GREEK WAR OF INDEPENDENCE 1825
It was this international position, with Russia still unwilling to act on her own but increasingly resentful of the obstruction of the other great powers, which was reshaped by the landing of Egyptian troops in the Morea. The forces of Ibrahim Pasha, aided by the incessant feuds of different Greek factions, made rapid progress in the first months of 1825. Indeed as one leading historian of the struggle has pointed out ‘only the incompetence of the Turkish fleet prevented the complete collapse of the revolt’.1 Yet the increasingly desperate position of the Greeks for long produced no effective action on their behalf from the great powers. Ibrahim’s soldiers began to land in southern Greece at the end of February, at the very moment when the second phase of the St. Petersburg congress opened. This time Britain was not represented; and though the meetings of Russian, French, Austrian and Prussian representatives dragged on until the end of April they proved quite futile. A protocol of 7 April by which the four powers agreed to propose their mediation at the Porte was a mere gesture. Simultaneous notes presented by the Russian government on 16 April in Paris, Vienna and Berlin, which urged the need for ‘concerted, energetic and rapid’ measures to end the war, were also ineffective. Metternich in particular was strongly opposed to any action which seemed likely to strengthen the rebels in Greece. Russia, already disillusioned by the grudging and uncooperative attitude of Britain, was now equally disappointed by that of her continental allies. A change of policy was being forced upon her. On 18 August Nesselrode, in a circular despatch to Russian representatives abroad, asserted that ‘it will be quite useless to become involved in new discussions with Russia’s allies over the affairs of Turkey’.? Henceforth, he went on, ‘Russia will follow her own views exclusively and will be governed by her own interests’. His disappointment was understandable. For over four years Russia had been trying to co-operate (admittedly more or less on her own terms) with the other powers of Europe in the Greek question. For a decade Alexander I had been seeking to work with them on the affairs of Europe in general. This attitude had now been abandoned, at least for the time being. Nicholas I, who succeeded his brother in December, was much less willing than Alexander to sacrifice the
real interests of Russia to dreams of international co-operation. If his
allies would not co-operate with him, he told St. Prie, the French

1825-6 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 ambassador in St. Petersburg, they must allow him to act alone. Yet before the end of 1825, even before the death of Alexander I, both Canning and the Russian government were beginning to think in terms of a possible Anglo-Russian combination over Greece. By September Canning was willing to mediate between the Porte and its Greek subjects, and to co-operate in this way with Alexander I if the latter wished it. The devastation and depopulation of the Morea by Ibrahim’s army was having a powerful and unfavourable effect on British public opinion; and the British minister was anxious to prevent the outbreak of a Russo—Turkish war with all its possible repercussions on the balance of power. Moreover co-operation with Russia might complete the breakup of the Congress system which Canning so much desired. Even before his death Alexander I on his side had hinted that he might be willing to break with his continental allies and make some arrangement with Britain over the Greek question. Nicholas in his turn was anxious to have if not the support at least the neutrality of Britain in any future Russo—Turkish war. An Anglo—Russian agreement, or at least the possibility of one, began to emerge in informal discussions between Canning and Lieven (and still more between Canning and the formidable Princess Lieven) in December; at the end of that month the Russian ambassador reported that ‘England is moving towards us’. But the two powers were still very far from trusting each other. Canning continued to hope that Britain might be able to mediate alone between the Porte and its Greek subjects and sent his cousin Stratford Canning as ambassador to Constantinople early in 1826 for this purpose. It was only the violent personal hostility of Mahmud II to the Greeks and the refusal of the Porte to make any substantial concession to them which nullified such hopes. Nicholas for his part had not the slightest intention of placing Russia’s Near Eastern policy under British control. He might, in suitable conditions, be willing to co-operate with Britain over the Greek question. But the other points at issue between Russia and the Porte, above all in the Caucasus, were to be completely free from her interference. Nevertheless the two powers were slowly moving towards an agreement. The British government had decided at the end of 1825 to send the Duke of Wellington, whose personal prestige in Europe was far greater than that of any other Englishman, on a special mission to St. Petersburg. His instructions, of 10 February 1826, envisaged the use of force by Britain and Russia, in co-operation, to cut off Ibrahim in the Morea and create there an autonomous state tributary to the Sultan and guaranteed by the powers.

Wellington had been pushed into signing the protocol by fear that Russian action against the Turks was imminent. On 17 March the Russian government had despatched to Constantinople a note which was virtually an ultimatum. The privileges of the Principalities must be restored; the terms of the treaty of Bucharest, especially the clause relating to the autonomy of Serbia, must be observed. A plenipotentiary must be sent to some point on the Russian frontier to negotiate a settlement of outstanding issues between the two states; if this were not done within six weeks hostilities were threatened. Early in May the Sultan accepted this ultimatum and sent representatives to the little town of Akkerman on the estuary of the Dniester, where negotiations with the Russians began early in August. On 7 October these bore fruit in the Convention of Akkerman. By this the Porte agreed to re-establish all the privileges of the Principalities and to grant similar ones to Serbia (these were enumerated in a separate agreement attached to the convention
proper). It also recognised the right of Russia to retain her existing
possessions in the Caucasus; the Turks were forced to accept Sukhum and other points on the coast of Abkhazia as Russian territory. Finally merchantmen flying the Russian flag were to have freedom
of navigation on all domestic waterways of the Ottoman Empire.
Russian diplomacy seemed to have won great successes. It had
achieved agreement with Britain on the Greek question and a
favourable settlement of the other points at issue with Turkey. Yet
these successes were largely illusory. Canning much disliked Article

III of the Anglo—Russian protocol, whose implications he saw at
once. Moreover his position was complicated by disagreements with
other members of the cabinet and by the anti-Russian attitude of George IV. He therefore refused Russian proposals for more active measures to help the Greeks and for a pacific blockade to hamper Turkish operations against them. He was willing merely to put moral pressure on the Turks by withdrawing the British ambassador from Constantinople if all proposals for mediation in the Greco—Turkish war failed; and then only if the other powers agreed. Mahmud II for his part had accepted the convention of Akkerman largely to gain time. In June 1826, in the most bloody coup de force in the history of the Ottoman Empire, he had massacred in Constantinople several thousand of the Janissaries who had so long and successfully opposed its reform.! The way now seemed open for changes, above all military changes, on a scale hitherto thought impossible in Turkey; but time was needed to carry them out and had to be bought by the concessions made at Akkerman. Moreover neither Canning nor Metternich wished to give Nicholas I a pretext for military action against the Turks. Both of them therefore pressed Mahmud strongly to negotiate with the Russians. But for this the Sultan, in spite of all his difficulties, might have refused the ultimatum of 7 March, for anti-Russian feeling was now running high in Constantinople. The Sultan in fact carried out the terms agreed at Akkerman only very slowly and reluctantly, and future Russo—Turkish disputes were unlikely to be settled so peacefully. Moreover from June 1826 onwards the Russian government was hampered by a minor but irritating war with Persia. The last months of 1826 and the first ones of 1827 brought no real solution to the problem of co-operation between Russia and the other great powers. At the end of 1826 Austria, France and Prussia were asked by Britain and Russia to share in the work of peacemaking in Greece. Metternich refused to contemplate coercion of the Turks. The Prussian government would sign no agreement unless Austria did so. France was willing to co-operate (largely because Charles X wished to improve relations with Britain) but wanted to turn the protocol of 4 April into a formal treaty which she would sign. This was done on 6 July 1827, when the British, French and Russian governments concluded the treaty of London. Its terms were essentially the same as those of the Protocol, apart from a clause which provided that if either belligerent refused to agree to

THE GREEK WAR OF INDEPENDENCE 1827
an armistice the three powers should ‘jointly exert all their efforts to accomplish the object of such an armistice’. Under Russian pressure (in June Nesselrode threatened independent action if measures were not taken to force the Turks to yield) the British and French governments now ordered their naval commanders in the Mediterranean to cut off supplies from Egypt and to blockade the Dardanelles if the Porte refused to end the struggle. They were also told, however, that they must not engage in hostilities with the Turks or Egyptians. Such contradictory instructions would clearly be very difficult to carry out. The Greek government, led by Capodistrias who had been elected President for a seven-year term in April 1827, accepted on 3 September the armistice proposed by the allies. But its control of its own subjects was so slight that this acceptance was purely nominal. Mahmud II, for his part, declared that ‘he would never allow the interference of foreign powers in his relations with his own subjects’, and was strengthened in this attitude by the fact that the Turks had recaptured Athens in June. Early in September, therefore, the allies began a blockade of the Morea and several of the Greek islands to cut off seaborne supplies to the Turkish forces there, a blockade which could be made effective only by the use of force. ‘How’, asked Admiral Codrington, the British commander, ‘can we coerce the Turks without hostilitie?s’!On 8 September the Egyptian fleet reached the port of Navarino. On the 12th Codrington arrived with the British squadron and found a large Turco—Egyptian force at anchor in the harbour. On the 21st the French squadron made its appearance and four days later Ibrahim agreed to suspend operations on land for twenty days or until he had received orders from Constantinople. On 10 October the Russian squadron arrived. Ten days later the allied squadrons began to enter the harbour, ostensibly to press Ibrahim to return to Egypt but clearly with the expectation that a battle would take place. Just after midday on the 20th the Turks began the struggle by firing on a British flag of truce; a few hours later the Turkish and Egyptian fleets had been virtually annihilated. The battle, which strengthened enormously the position of the Greeks, aroused strong reactions in the capitals of Europe. It merely hardened the attitude of the Turkish government, which continued to refuse allied mediation or recognition of the Greeks as anything but rebels; and events now moved rapidly towards a crisis. On 31 November the Porte repudiated the convention of Akkerman. On 8 December the British and French ambassadors left Constanti

nople for Corfu, followed a few days later by the Russian minister.
On 18 December Mahmud II, as Caliph, called on all Muslims to aid him in a holy war against Russia, his ‘great enemy’. At the end of February 1828 the Straits were virtually closed to foreign ships. Mohammed Ali, unlike his suzerain, was anxious merely to escape from Greece without further disasters. Even before Navarino he had offered to withdraw from the Morea if in return Britain would support his retention of the Hejaz and his acquisition of Syria. On g August 1828, therefore, Codrington was able to sign with him a convention for the evacuation of Egyptian troops from Greece. But clearly the Sultan would still oppose a stiff resistance to the powers whatever the attitude of his vassal. In Vienna Navarino was seen as a catastrophe which threatened to produce Russian domination of the Balkans, the disruption of the Ottoman Empire and perhaps a period of general chaos in Europe. Metternich was particularly worried by the fact that if war with the Turks broke out Russia would be able to blockade Constantinople by sea as well as attack it by land, while Francis IT wished to mobilise a force of 100,000 men to be used if necessary to support the Turks. The Russian government, unlike those of western Europe, was not shocked by the slaughter of Navarino and showed, when the Porte did not give way, that it was prepared for further action against the Ottoman Empire. In particular the refusal of the Sultan to observe the terms agreed at Akkerman greatly stiffened the Russian attitude. Nesselrode made it clear, in a despatch to Lieven of 5 December, that the Tsar and his ministers were ready to send Russian troops into the Principalities to force the Turks to accept a settlement. In January 1828 he proposed that the allies might even penetrate the Straits and dictate peace ‘under the walls of the Seraglio’ (the Sultan’s palace). The Turks should be ordered to evacuate Greece and the ambassadors at Constantinople of the great powers should meet somewhere in the Aegean and draw up a settlement. Two months later Admiral Heiden, the Russian commander in the Mediterranean, was ordered to support the Greeks with arms and equipment as far as he could, while efforts were also made to supply them with Russian money. Pressure for war with Turkey was steadily growing in St. Petersburg and the conclusion of peace with Persia on 22 February, by the treaty of Turkmanchai, helped to free Russia’s hands for such a war. The Greek question, however, was rapidly becoming a secondary issue in Russo—Turkish relations in the first months of 1828. They now centred much more around the execution of the convention of Akkerman, an issue of far greater direct importance to Russia.

That struggle broke out at the end of April, and added still further to the fear and dislike with which Russia was now regarded by the British and Austrian governments. Nesselrode was seriously worried by the possibility of an Anglo—Russian naval conflict in the Mediterranean, while Tatishchev, the Russian ambassador in Vienna, soon began to send home alarming reports of possible Austrian military intervention.? Clearly Russia must press matters to a conclusion if possible before any other power could take a hand in the struggle. ‘The war will be carried on with all possible vigour under the eyes of the Emperor himself’, wrote Nesselrode to Lieven on 29 April, ‘since he knows quite well that on the speed of our successes will depend the attitude of the other powers.”* But a quick end to the
1 Here he differed from his main subordinate, Sir Robert Peel, who saw that an independent Greece was much less likely than a weak Turkish vassal-state to fall under Russian influence. 2 He had already reported, in despatches of 11 June and 24 November 1827, that in case of aRusso—Turkish war Austria would try to seize Serbia and that she
might even invade the Principalities (Fadeev, op. cit., p. 200). Fear of possible
reactions in Vienna was the main reason why the Russians made little effort to
rouse the Balkan peoples against the Turks in 1828-9 (ibid., pp. 291-2). On the
Tsar’s unwillingness to antagonise Austria see T. Schiemann, Geschichte Russlands unter Nikolaus I (Berlin, 1904-19), 1. 445. 3 Fadeev, op. cit., p. 184.

1828-9 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
conflict proved difficult to achieve. After some early successes the Russian advance was checked when an attempt to storm Braila, an important fortress on the Danube, failed on 15 June. Turkish military organisation showed most ofits usual ineptitude, but the Russian supply-system was almost equally poor and the Russian armies were soon suffering acutely from dysentery. The port and fortress of Varna, on the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria, did not fall until 11 October; and a paper blockade of the Dardanelles proclaimed on 18 September did nothing to weaken Turkish resistance. On the Caucasian front the fortress of Kars was taken on 5 July; but in general the campaigns of 1828 added little to Russia’s military reputation. Her military difficulties, moreover, were reflected on the diplomatic level. The Porte refused to treat for peace without Austrian and Prussian guarantees that Russia would not be permitted to interfere further in the affairs of Greece, while at the end of the year Metternich unsuccessfully proposed a general congress on Near Eastern affairs. This, he hoped, would force Russia to make peace and disrupt the insecure Anglo—Russo—French alliance. It was clear, however, that Wellington, faced by unpalatable facts, was slowly weakening in his resistance to concessions to the Greeks. In May 1828 his cabinet was reformed and became a more homogeneous and solidly Tory body. This gave him greater freedom of action in foreign affairs; and on 19 July, he at last agreed to the sending of a French force to occupy the More—ain effect a pledge that the area would not be returned to Turkish rule. This was followed on 16 November by a protocol which placed it and many of the Greek islands under the provisional guarantee of Britain, France and Russia until their fate had been settled by agreement with the Porte. It was not until the middle of 1829 that the war began to run decisively in Russia’s favour; but then the collapse of Turkish resistance was rapid. On 11 June the Russian army in the Principalities won an important victory at Kulevcha, south-east of Shumla. Silistria on the Danube fell on the 30th and during the following month the army crossed the Balkan mountains. Erzerum, the greatest fortress of Turkish Armenia, fell on 27 June; by early August the Russians were only fifty miles from the Black Sea port of Trebizond. On the 1gth of that month Adrianople fell without resistance and the Russians were within striking distance of the Turkish capital. By 7 September they had reached the Aegean and some cavalry units were less than forty miles from Constantinople. From early in August the Turks had been sounding General Matadoy.

1829 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 Some foreign observers realised that Russian policy in the Near East was fluid and changing, not the carefully-planned and precisely-conducted thing that it seemed to Russophobe pamphleteers. In particular Lord Heytesbury, British representative at the headquarters of the Russian army in 1828-9, saw that Russia now wanted influence rather than territory in the Balkans and expected her to gain a position in the Ottoman Empire comparable to that she had enjoyed in Poland before 1772. But the deliberations of the special committee were unknown to the British and French governments and their representatives, to whom the situation in August-September 1829 seemed very grave. A Russian advance on Constantinople might lead to a revolution there resulting in the overthrow of the Sultan and great massacres of Christians. Sir Robert Gordon, the new British ambassador to the Porte, who had returned to Constantinople in June together with Guilleminot, his French colleague, was particularly alarmed. ‘Nothing but an imminent cessation of Hostilities’, he wrote on 26 August, ‘can possibly save this empire from total destruction. The internal disorder is even more alarming than that from [sc] which it is threatened from without; disaffection and insubordination have reached the highest pitch.’! On 9 September, therefore, Gordon and Guilleminot appealed jointly to Diebitsch to advance no further. They also agreed to ask the Porte to summon the British and French Mediterranean squadrons into the Dardanelles if necessary to protect the Turkish capital. Muffling, the Prussian minister to the Porte, had already urged the Russian commander not to be too exacting in the peace terms he demanded. These appeals probably had little influence on the situation; but once the peace negotiations had got properly under way, on 2 September, they were rapidly pushed to a conclusion. The Turks, impressed by the speed of Diebitsch’s advance, overestimated the strength of the Russian position and did not indulge in their usual delaying tactics. The main outlines of the peace were settled by the 12th, when the Turkish plenipotentiaries agreed to pay a war indemnity which they had hitherto strenuously resisted. On the 14th the treaty of Adrianople was signed. By it Russia made only small territorial gains in Europe. There she annexed merely the mouth of the Danube, pushing forward her frontier to the St. George’s branch (the most westerly one) of its delta. In Asia her gains were much greater. The Porte recognised her annexation of Georgia and eastern Armenia, while the important harbours of Anapa and Poti were left in her

1829 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 to Wellington and his Foreign Secretary, Lord Aberdeen, much too generous to Greece. The new state, they assumed, would be a mere satellite of Russia; hence it should be kept as small as possible. Wellington wished to push its frontier further south, if possible almost to the Gulf of Corinth, while Aberdeen was strongly opposed to giving it Crete. The result of their attitude, after negotiations in London, was an Anglo-Franco-Russian protocol of 22 March 1829 which drew the frontiers of the new Greek state considerably south of the Arta—Volo line and also deprived it of Crete and Samos. This protocol the Turks were forced to accept by Article X of the treaty of Adrianople. As yet the British, French and Russian governments still thought in terms of a merely autonomous Greece. Even Russia preferred to see a Greek state tributary to the Porte rather than an independent one, for an independent and perhaps republican Greece would be a serious blow to the cause of legitimism all over Europe. But events were slowly moving in favour of complete independence for the Greeks of the Morea and most of the islands. Wellington disliked the terms of Adrianople and felt that they gave Russia excessive privileges in the Ottoman Empire. He was now increasingly disillusioned by the turn events had taken in the Near East and by the inability of the Turks to defend themselves effectively. ‘All I wish’, he told Aberdeen early in October 1829, ‘is to get out of the Greek affair without loss of honour and without inconvenient risk to the safety of the Ionian Islands.” If, as was plain, the Greeks could not be brought once more under direct Turkish rule, their complete independence was not much more objectionable than their autonomy. If the Ottoman Empire were on the point of collapse, as the Duke increasingly believed, there was no point in putting the Greeks under a suzerain who could not protect or control them. Aberdeen told Gordon on 10 November 1830 that ‘independently of all foreign or hostile impulse, this clumsy fabric of barbarous power [i.e. the Ottoman Empire] will speedily crumble into pieces from its own inherent causes of decay. ... We cannot reasonably look for any long continuance of its existence’.2 Thus the structure of the new Greek state, he went on, became a matter of much greater importance than hitherto; it might be given a larger territory and must have ‘a moderate and prudent Prince’ as its ruler. Metternich also was now prepared to accept an independent Greece with the Arta-Volo frontier, since such a state seemed more likely to resist
Crawley, op. cit., p. 168. The Ionian islands had been placed by the Congress of Vienna under a British protectorate and the revolt in Greece had aroused much sympathy among their Greek inhabitants. 2 Puryear, op. cit., p. 102.

THE GREEK WAR OF INDEPENDENCE 1827-32
Russian influence than a mere autonomous principality. The Russian government, though it still preferred to see Greece a Turkish tributary with generous frontiers, made no great resistance to her emergence as a smaller but independent state. Meanwhile it was becoming more and more urgent to restore order in the new state and equip it with some stable and effective government. The election of Capodistrias as president had been immediately followed by the drawing-up of a new republican constitution in May 1827; for the next four years he made a sustained effort to impose on his unruly subjects a centralised and bureaucratic system of government. Probably the ablest and certainly the least self-seeking of the Greek leaders, Capodistrias was deeply unpopular. His centralising policies involved the overriding of the traditional power in their own localities of the primates, the landowners, shipowners and churchmen who had from the beginning played a leading role in the rebellion. His arrogance turned possible collaborators into enemies and, as the presumed puppet of Russia, he was suspect to the British and French governments. Even after the signature of the protocol of 22 March 1829 he continued to press, with some Russian support, for the inclusion in Greece of Crete and Samos. By February 1830 Britain, France and Russia, after discussing a number of candidates for the position, had agreed to make Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, a member of one of the German princely families, ruler of an independent Greek state. Capodistrias, however, anxious to maintain his position, induced Leopold to refuse the throne by sending him exaggerated reports of the opposition he would encounter if he accepted it. During the next two years the position in Greece became increasingly chaotic. By 1831 the islands, where the president was especially disliked, had ceased to obey him and he was forced to appeal to the Russian squadron in the Mediterranean for help in crushing a revolt in the wealthy island of Hydra. In October of that year he was murdered by members of the Mavromichali family, a dynasty of landowners in the Morea with which he had for long been on bad terms. His disappearance was followed by civil war; and not until February 1832, when Britain, France and Russia agreed on the Crown Prince Otto of Bavaria as ruler of the new state, did some prospect of stability begin to appear. Even then the omens were by no means promising. Otto was a Catholic and therefore not a good choice as ruler of Greece, where Orthodoxy was still more popular
than secular nationalism.! He was a boy of 17; it had therefore to be

arranged that Greece should be governed by three Bavarian regents
until he came of age. His new kingdom was bankrupt and much of it
desperately poor; the protecting powers had therefore to guarantee
a loan to Greece of 60 million francs. Nevertheless on 6 February 1833 Otto and the regents landed at Nauplia with 3,000 Bavarian soldiers. In August the remnants of the French army of occupation sent to the Morea in 1828 were withdrawn. The inglorious history of the Greek monarchy had begun. Some months before her new ruler set foot on its soil the country’s frontiers had been settled. The fall of Wellington’s cabinet in November 1830 and its replacement by the Whig government led by Earl Grey produced an immediate change in the British attitude on this point. Lord Palmerston, Grey’s Foreign Secretary, was strongly in favour of pushing forward the frontier to the Arto—Volo line proposed in 1828 by the Paros conference. He also felt that Crete might become part of Greece and that Samos should have some form of autonomy. But from August 1830 onwards the powers were preoccupied for well over a year by the revolt which broke out in Belgium in that month and which disrupted the Kingdom of the Netherlands established in 1815. Not until the autumn of 1831 were they free to give much attention to Greece. On 7 May 1832 a convention signed by Britain, France, Russia and Bavaria established Greece as an independent kingdom under the rule of Prince Otto and gave her the Arta—Volo frontier. On 21 July this was accepted by the Sultan. The ineptitude of the Turks, the unplanned massacre at Navarino, the Russian successes of 1829 and the increasingly favourable attitude of Britain had not merely ensured the survival of the Greek rebels but given them final victory and independence. Greece in 1832 laboured under crippling handicaps. She was deeply divided, badly governed, for the most part miserably poor. Only a small minority of those who regarded themselves as Greeks lived on her territory ;in Macedonia, Constantinople, Asia Minor, Crete and the Ionian Islands there were still 24 million Hellenes under foreign rule while the population of the new kingdom was only about 800,000. The passions and vicissitudes of the new state’s later history were implicit in the circumstances of its birth. But the emergence of an independent Greece was an event of European, not merely of Near Eastern significance. Far more clearly than the Serb revolt of 1804 or the power enjoyed for so long by Ali Pasha of Jannina, more clearly even than the quasi-independence of Mohammed Ali in Egypt, it exposed the decline and enfeeblement of the Ottoman Empire with all that that implied for the stability of Europe. Earlier than the 1830

At the very moment of its establishment, none the less, the Greek kingdom and its difficulties were being pushed completely into the background by events in Syria. From November 1831 the Sultan was at war there with his ambitious vassal Mohammed Ali; and it was by a virtual promise of British support in this war that Stratford Canning, now once more British ambassador to the Porte, had induced Mahmud II to sign the protocol of 21 July 1832 which recognised the new Greek frontier. The idea of adding Syria to his dominions had long attracted Mohammed Ali! and in November 1827, in the aftermath of Navarino, the Porte appears to have promised him the three pashaliks into which it was divided in return for a promise of military help if Britain, France and Russia should attack the Ottoman Empire. Moreover the Pasha’s willingness to submit to Turkish suzerainty was declining. In 1829 he refused a demand from Mahmud II for the supply of 15,000 Egyptian soldiers for the war against Russia and in May 1830 he made his chief subordinates in Egypt (most of them Turks) promise to stand by him in case of a Turkish attack. Mohammed Ali was well aware of the importance of European support in any conflict with his suzerain. For several years before he attacked Syria he had enjoyed close relations with France and attempted to establish them with Britain. In particular from the autumn of 1829 onwards he had been involved in a plan, drawn up by Drovetti, the French consul-general in Egypt, for him to conquer with French support the de facto independent regencies of Tripoli, Tunis and Algiers, which were still theoretically part of the Ottoman Empire. This, it was argued, would wipe out piracy there, revive normal trade and allow the Porte to collect worth-while amounts in tribute. Also France would acquire part of the Tunisian coast after the Egyptians had conquered it. Nothing came of this plan — partly because of the opposition of Britain, partly because
the Porte refused to issue a firman placing the regencies under
Mohammed Ali and partly because of the Pasha’s excessive de
mands for French money and ships. By the beginning of March 1830
the Franco—Egyptian negotiations had broken down and the French
government had realised that if it wanted a foothold in North Africa
1 He had told Missett, the British consul-general in Egypt, as early as 1812 that
he meant to conquer the province as soon as he could (H. Dodwell, The Founder of
Modern Egypt: Muhamma‘dAli (Cambridge, 1931), p. 107).
Wh

it must conquer one for itself. But the Drovetti project showed clearly the importance which France at least now attached to Mohammed Ali as a force in the politics of the Mediterranean and the Levant. To the Pasha an alliance with Britain was at least as useful as one with France: and as soon as it was clear that the negotiations with France had failed he began to make advances to the British government. On 7 March he told Barker, the British consul in Egypt, that if Britain would support him his empire would provide her with an army of 125,000 men ready to check any growth of Russian influence in Constantinople or Persia. The peoples of the Ottoman Empire, he went on, had lost confidence in the Sultan and would flock to his own banner if only he had British support. The British government was unresponsive. The Ottoman Empire might be doomed; but Britain would do nothing to hasten its fall. Moreover she had no tradition of interest in Egypt comparable to that which existed in France. Generations of Catholic missionary activity had created this tradition; schemes of French conquest, culminating in Napoleon’s invasion in 1798, had nourished it; the presence of many French officers in Mohammed Ali’s forces and a growing French trade with Egypt kept it very much alive. None of these factors existed in Britain. The Pasha thus moved towards a break with Mahmud II backed by a good deal of French sympathy but without a guarantee of support from any of the powers. Mohammed Ali’s conflict with the Sultan arose out of the intense bad feeling which existed between him and Ibrahim Pasha of Acre. Preparations had been made for an Egyptian expedition against Acre in the early summer of 1831; but these were delayed by the cholera epidemic which affected most of Europe at this time and the conquest of Syria did not begin until November. It was at first a slow process, for Ibrahim Pasha defended Acre gallantly against his namesake, the eldest son of Mohammed Ali. The fortress did not fall until the end of May 1832. Then the Egyptian advance became much more rapid. Damascus fell on 13 June without resistance and in July Ibrahim twice defeated the Turks, at Homs and in the Beylan Pass between Antioch and Alexandretta. The Turkish reaction to these events was slow and feeble. It was only at the end of April that the Porte publicly declared war on Mohammed Ali and appointed another viceroy of Egypt in his
? Particularly over the refusal of the latter to return the Egyptian peasants who fled in large numbers to Syria to escape the intolerable burdens which Mohammed Ali’s taxation and conscription imposed on them. The Pasha of Egypt also wished to control Syria’s coal and timber and her valuable silk exports.

place. However the pasha, in spite of his successes, showed the caution which was often henceforth to mark his policies. Against the advice of his son he did not follow up the victories which Ibrahim won in July. Instead there followed five months of inactivity during which he tried vainly to obtain either a settlement with the Sultan on his own terms or the support of the European powers. In August, he attempted to open negotiations with the Porte through the Kapudan Pasha, the commander of the Turkish fleet; but this led to nothing. Proposals for the use of French good offices to restore peace, made in September by Sébastiani, the French Foreign Minister, and repeated in November by his successor, the Duc de Broglie, also had no result. In December, therefore, Ibrahim began his advance once more. On the 27th of that month, at Koniah, he won one of his greatest victories. The Turks were routed and their commander, the Grand Vizier, taken prisoner. The Egyptian army was now advancing into Asia Minor with little organised Turkish resistance between it and Constantinople. Clearly a crisis of first-class importance had emerged in the Near East and the great powers, above all Britain and Russia, could no longer avoid reacting to it. The British government, its attention fully engaged in the Iberian peninsula and the Netherlands, paid surprisingly little attention to events in Syria in 1831-2. In particular it was deaf to Turkish appeals for help. Before he left Constantinople in August 1832 Stratford Canning had received proposals for an Anglo—Turkish alliance and, as has already been said,! had held out to Mahmud II the prospect of British support. Early in November, Mavroyéni, the Turkish chargé d’affaires in Vienna, arrived in London to ask for help in resisting the Egyptians. Six weeks later another Turkish emissary, Namik Pasha, arrived for the same purpose. None of these offers and pleas had any result. The British cabinet was preoccupied by events in Belgium and by the approaching general election. Some of its members— Lord Holland and even the Prime Minister, Earl Grey — believed the collapse of the Ottoman Empire to be inevitable. Palmerston was willing, by the end of the year, to give the Sultan moral support, acting in concert with Austria and Russia; but the cabinet would not agree even to this. The British navy was already fully occupied in the Netherlands and Portugal ;if new ships had to be put into commission for use in the Levant the resulting
expense would provide an attractive pretext for opposition attacks on the government.
Nor did Britain co-operate with any other great power in the
Near East. Metternich was at least as anxious as Palmerston to aSeelp. 77.
79


1832-3 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 safeguard the Ottoman Empire, but the two men never found it easy
to work together. To some extent this was merely a question of personal prestige. If some international concert on Near Eastern affairs were to be established Metternich wished it to be centred on Vienna, Palmerston on London. But Britain and Austria were also separated by more serious factors — by their differing attitudes to events in Belgium and Portugal, by Austria’s commitments to Russia and those of Britain to France. Thus a suggestion by Metternich in January 1833 that Britain co-operate with the three eastern powers, Russia, Austria and Prussia, came to nothing. The division between the relatively liberal great powers of western Europe and the conservative ones of central and eastern Europe, which was now unmistakable, tended to paralyse any united action by them in the Levant. These divisions, and British inactivity, were to allow Russia to win an important and apparently dangerous diplomatic success. Nicholas I, faithful to the spirit of the advice given him in 1829, had no desire to see the Ottoman Empire collapse in face of the Egyptian challenge, which he regarded as ‘a result of the spirit of insurrection which has now seized Europe and especially France’.+ He never for a moment doubted that the empire would soon break up and in February 1833 approached the Austrian government for some agreement on the attitude the two powers should adopt when it finally did so. ‘I lack the power to give life to a corpse’, he told Ficquelmont the Austrian ambassador in St. Petersburg, ‘and the Turkish empire is dead.’? Nevertheless he wished to postpone its disappearance for as long as possible. Its destruction, he rightly felt, would lead to a scramble by the great powers for territory and influence in the Near East and perhaps to a European war. Moreover Mohammed Ali, if he succeeded in creating a great ‘Arab Empire’ embracing Syria, Mesopotamia and parts of Asia Minor, might prove a much more dangerous neighbour to Russia than Mahmud II had ever been. For these reasons the Tsar was willing to give the Sultan active help in resisting the demands of his vassal. Mahmud, with no hope of effective support from an indifferent Britain and a somewhat pro-Egyptian France, was now driven to look to the hereditary enemy in the north as a possible saviour. As early as the summer of 1832 he had begun to sound Butenev, the Russian minister in Constantinople, as to the possibility of Russia helping him against the Egyptians; and at the end of November Nesselrode told Butenev that a Russian squadron would be im

mediately forthcoming if the Sultan should ask for it. The disaster at
Koniah made almost irresistible the pressure on Mahmud to accept
Russian aid. Even before news of the battle reached Constantinople Nicholas had begun to act. On 25 December 1832 General N. N. Muraviev landed in the Turkish capital to make preparations for Russian naval and military help to the Porte. On 1 January 1833 news arrived from Mavroyeni in London that the British naval assistance which the Turkish government had asked for would not be given. Even at this juncture an effort was made to reach a settlement directly with Mohammed Ali and thus avoid Russian intervention. Rifaat Khalil Pasha was sent to Alexandria for this purpose on the 7th but did not arrive there until a fortnight later. However Muravieyv, his work in Constantinople completed, had reached Egypt on the 13th and, with the support of the Austrian consul, Acerbi, forced Mohammed Ali to agree to make peace with the Sultan and to suspend hostilities until it was made. This agreement was quite worthless. Ibrahim Pasha was a soldier; he had none of his father’s timidity and reliance on diplomacy and intrigue. He had already proposed, in November 1831, that the deposition of the Sultan be proclaimed. After Koniah he had strongly urged an immediate march on Constantinople and had been restrained only by the opposition of his father. Now, on 20 January 1833, he began his advance once more. By the beginning of February he had reached Kutiah, only 150 miles from the Turkish capital. There he was halted by orders from Cairo. But the vital decision had now been taken in Constantinople. On 2 February Mahmud II formally asked that a Russian army of 30,000 men should cross the Danube and advance through the Balkans to defend Constantinople. Four Russian ships of the line and as many frigates were also asked for and on 20 February a Russian squadron entered the Bosphorus. On the 16th couriers had reached the Turkish capital with the peace terms demanded by Mohammed Ali — the cession to him of the whole of Syria and the district of Adana in Asia Minor.! Backed by its new ally, the Porte refused to accept such a proposal. It is significant of the supineness of the two great western powers with respect to Near Eastern affairs that at the moment when the Porte thus committed itself to accepting Russian help Britain and France were each represented in Constantinople merely by a chargé d’affaires. However the new French ambassador, Admiral Roussin, a
1 [brahim had wished to demand much more — Crete, most of the south coast of Asia Minor, and perhaps Tunisia and Tripolitania.

combative and headlong character, arrived a few days later and at once began a campaign to break the new Russo—Turkish entente. He at first threatened to leave the capital if Russian troops were allowed to land in the Straits area. When this had no effect he signed with the Porte, on 21 February, a convention by which he guaranteed that Mohammed Ali would make peace on the basis of the abandonment

to him of the Syrian pashaliks alone without Adana. In return the
Turkish government promised to ask for the withdrawal of Russian
forces from its territory. Next day Roussin, in a letter to Mohammed
Ali, threatened the withdrawal of French officers from Egypt and an Anglo-French naval blockade if Ibrahim did not withdraw to Syria. But this French initiative had come too late. Mohammed Ali now realised that he had made a mistake in delaying his son’s advance on Constantinople and was in no mood for further concessions. On g March he sent an envoy to the Turkish capital with an ultimatum: he must have Adana as well as Syria otherwise Ibrahim would continue his advance. The Porte at once found that it could rely on no effective support, even from Russia, against this threat. Butenev had to confess that Russian troops could not arrive in time to defend Constantinople. Roussin urged immediate acceptance of Mohammed Ali’s demands to avoid the need for any landing of Russian troops at all. Mandeville, the British chargé d’affaires, was also in favour of acceptance if there were no prospect of carrying on the struggle with success. On 30 March, therefore, a Turkish envoy was sent to Ibrahim’s camp to invest his father with the governorship of the three Syrian pashaliks. Simultaneously Butenev was asked to summon a force of 5,000 Russians from Odessa, not to fight the Egyptian army but to defend the capital against any surprise attack Ibrahim might launch. The Russian troops landed at Buyukdéré, on the Bosphorus a few miles north of Constantinople, on 5 April. Their arrival, an unprecedented event in the history of the Ottoman Empire, aroused a good deal of popular discontent and the Mufti, the most important Moslem canon lawyer in the capital, showed himself very unwilling to issue a fetva sanctioning the acceptance of the help of unbelievers against fellow-Moslems. But the dependence of the Porte on Russian support was, for the time being, almost complete. (A third Russian squadron arrived in the Straits towards the end of April and brought to a total of 14,000 the number of Russian soldiers landed on the Bosphorus.) The Turkish ministers made last-minute efforts to retain control of Adana, whose timber resources would be of great value to the Egyptians, but in vain. Early in May Ibrahim was appointed its Mohassel (collector of taxes), a device which did something to save the Porte’s face but which gave the Egyptians the substance of their demands.
1 Mohammed Ali, who was now under heavy pressure from the British and French consuls in Egypt to make peace at once (Campbell, the British consul, threatened a blockade of Alexandria if this were not done) would in fact have been willing to abandon Adana if the Turks had held out a little longer.

1833 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
The end of the Turco-Egyptian struggle, however, merely intensified the friction between the great powers in the Near East. On 5 May Count A. F. Orlov, one of the most skilled Russian diplomats of his generation, reached Constantinople. He had instructions to persuade the Porte to rely completely on Russian support, to combat British and above all French influence in the Turkish capital and to oppose any suggestion of collective interference by the great powers in the Near East. A fortnight later Nesselrode ordered him to make a defensive alliance with the Turks which would give Russia a dominant position in the Ottoman Empire and allow her to take the lead, if necessary, in either preserving or partitioning it. In return for Russian backing the Sultan must help to defend southern Russia in time of war; he could do this by closing the Straits to all foreign warships. Even before Orlov’s arrival Mahmud appears to have decided to ask for a defensive alliance with Russia, and negotiations for one began on 26 June. On 8 July the treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi was signed. This agreement, which was to last for eight years, confirmed the treaty of Adrianople and the Greek settlement and provided for each of the two signatories to help the other in case of outside attack. The Turks tried to demand a Russian guarantee of all Ottoman territory, but Orlov refused to give this; such a guarantee would be impossible to make good in the African regencies, Egypt and Syria, and would be regarded in western Europe as a veiled Russian protectorate. By a secret article, however, Russia declared that if she were attacked she would not call for Turkish naval and military help. Instead she would require merely that the Porte close the Straits to foreign warships ‘not allowing any foreign vessels of war to enter therein on any pretext whatever’.! This made no real change in the legal position regarding movement through the Straits. Their closure to foreign warships was a very ancient rule of the Ottoman Empire. It had been affirmed in the Anglo—Turkish treaty of 1809: it was now reaffirmed. As Nesselrode insisted, particularly in a circular of 17 August meant to explain the treaty to the powers, the terms of Unkiar-Skelessi imposed no new legal burden on Turkey. The exclusion of British and French warships from the Straits was of course valuable to Russia. It meant that in any war with these powers in which the Ottoman Empire was a neutral the Russian Black Sea coast would be free from attack. It
1 The Russian text of the secret article provided for the closing of the Dardanelles only, the Turkish one for that of ‘the Strait of the White Sea’ — i.e. the whole of the channel between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.

THE GREEK WAR OF INDEPENDENCE 1833
made it difficult for Britain to give effective help to the Circassian tribes of the western Caucasus in their long struggle, which did not end till the 1860s, to avoid Russian conquest. But there was nothing in the terms of the treaty to which the western powers could legitimately object. Nevertheless there were widespread fears in western Europe that, while barring other navies from the Straits it gave that of Russia free passage through them. Palmerston himself appears to have believed this; but the belief was false. At the beginning of 1838, when Nicholas I and Menshikov, the Russian Minister of Marine, wished to send a squadron from the Baltic to the Black Sea through the Straits, Nesselrode pointed out firmly that this would be an infringement of international law. ‘In the present state of our relations with Turkey,’ he wrote, ‘the treaties oblige the latter to close the entrance to the Dardanelles to any foreign war flag, but these transactions by no means oblige it to open it to us.... No stipulation authorises us to demand in the Bosphorus the admission of our war-ships.’! However behind the fears of Palmerston and many other contemporaries that Russian naval squadrons might henceforth be able to pass the Straits at will there lurked a larger, vaguer and more justified grievance. The treaty appeared to have given Russia, at least by implication, a special position in the Ottoman Empire. Turkey seemed to be becoming a Russian protectorate or vassal-state. Undoubtedly the Russians anticipated and desired a development of this kind. The treaty, wrote Nesselrode in his instructions of 8 May to Orlov, ‘will justify, if circumstances arise, the presence and use of our forces and will permit us to be again on the ground the first and the strongest in the theatre of events, so as always to remain masters of the question, either admitting the preservation of the Ottoman Empire as possible or finally admitting its dissolution as inevitable’. Later, after the treaty had been signed, he epitomised and justified the fears of Palmerston and those who thought like him by stating flatly that ‘our intervention in the affairs of Turkey has acquired a basis of legality’.2 The fact that these Russian hopes proved delusive, that the Porte refused to abandon its right to seek aid from powers other than Russia and that there was no second Russian expedition to the Straits, does not make the Anglo-French dislike of the treaty less understandable. That dislike, however, was quite impotent. Strong protests

1832-3 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 against the treaty by both powers in August 1833, as well as efforts to prevent its ratification in Constantinople, had no result. Russia’s position, indeed, was soon to become still stronger. In September Nicholas I met the Emperor Francis II and Metternich at Miinchengratz in Bohemia. Good relations between the two great conservative powers, somewhat shaken by Austrian fears of further Russian expansion in the Near East, seemed to be re-established. The two emperors did not, as many contemporaries believed, discuss a partition of the Ottoman Empire. On the contrary the public articles of the convention to which they agreed proclaimed their desire to maintain its integrity and the power of the Sultan, while secret articles made it clear that this declaration was aimed against Mohammed Ali and agreed that the two powers should co-operate if the position in the Near East were to change. But clearly Britain and France could not as yet hope to reverse the defeat which they had suffered. The events of 1832-3 were of the greatest importance in the history of Anglo—Russian relations. Anglo—Russian tension in the Near East was not new; it had existed during much of the Napoleonic wars and to a lesser extent in the early 1820s. But it was now more acute than ever before. For nearly two decades popular anti-Russian feeling had been growing in Britain. It was fed by the dislike of Russian autocracy and conservatism which was now strongly developed among British radicals and liberals, by fears of Russian dominance of Europe, and by resentment of Russian suppression of Poland. The crisis of 1832-3 and the treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi did not immediately arouse as much attention in the British press and parliament as might have been expected. But from the summer of 1833 onwards it became increasingly common for British journalists and pamphleteers to denounce Russia as a threat to the independence and existence of the Ottoman Empire (as a few of them had been doing in the 1820s and even earlier) ;and there was now a large reservoir of Russophobe feeling in Britain to which writing of this kind could appeal. Moreover the relative novelty of this AngloRussian rivalry in the Near East added to its sharpness. France was in many ways still a competitor of Britain in the Levant. But struggles with her all over the globe had been for generations a feature of British history. She was known and understood; rivalry with her seemed natural and could almost be taken for granted. Russia by contrast was remote, strange and little-known; she was frightening in a way that no other European state could be. Hostility to Russia,

moreover, carried with it hostility to Mohammed Ali, the man whose ambitions had brought a Russian army to the Straits and seemed to have established a Russian protectorate in Constantinople. The next phase in the history of the Eastern Question would clearly be marked by extreme British (and to a lesser degree French) suspicion of Russia and by British hostility to the Pasha of Egypt. The attitude of Mahmud II made it certain that a new crisis could not be long delayed.

CHAPTER FOUR
The Second Mohammed Ali Crisis
1833-41
THE defeats which he had suffered at the hands of Mohammed Ali in 1832-3 seemed to Mahmud II an intolerable humiliation. From the moment peace was made he was seeking an opportunity for revenge, a chance to recover Syria and Adana, perhaps even Egypt itself.1 Though he was hardly the ‘Peter the Great of the Ottoman Empire’ whom some historians have portrayed, and though his knowledge of Europe and its ideas was very slight, he had nevertheless a real urge to make his empire more modern and efficient. By the early 1830s he had effectively crushed, for the time being at least, the autonomy of the pashas and great landlords of most of Anatolia and the Balkan provinces, notably by the abolition in 1831 of the last remnants of feudal land tenure. The destruction of the Janissaries in 1826 had made possible the creation of a new and more modern army, European in its dress and techniques. ‘This in its turn generated the beginnings of a modern war ministry, a medical school (1827) and a School of Military Sciences (1834). Efforts were made, without much success, to increase the still tiny number of educated Turks with a knowledge of European languages; and in 1834 the embassies in the major European capitals, which had existed for a short time under Selim IIT, were re-established, this time for good. Something was done to weaken the power of the ulema by bringing religious foundations under government control, while in 1831 the first Turkish newspaper (though a purely official one) began publication. Few of these changes other than the military ones went very deep. In particular the reforms in the central administration which the Sultan introduced were for the most part superficial. Yet by the end of the Greek war the Ottoman Empire was once more, however reluctantly, launched on the path of slow and hesitant progress which it had abandoned after the death of Selim III. Mahmud,

THE SECOND MOHAMMED ALI GRISIS 1834-9
conscious that his power was growing and bitterly envious of what his vassal had achieved, was now increasingly anxious for a second trial of strength with Mohammed Ali. Thus he wished to take advantage of the revolt against Egyptian rule which broke out in the Nablus area of Palestine in May 1834, and which Turkish intrigues may have helped to provoke, to invade Syria. Only the very discouraging attitude of the British, French and Russian representatives at Constantinople prevented his doing so; and a few months later he urged the British government to put pressure on Mohammed Ali to give up all Syria except Acre. At the end of 1836 he even attempted to recover some of his lost territory by direct negotiation with his great rival. A Turkish envoy, SarimEffendi, was sent to Egypt, apparently to offer that Mohammed Ali should be succeeded there and in the Pashalik of Acre by one of his sons if in return he surrendered to the Sultan the rest of his possessions. Nothing came of this and Mahmud continued to dream of a successful war of revenge. None of the great powers, least of all Great Britain and Russia, liked or encouraged these dreams. Palmerston, who was Foreign Secretary throughout the 1830s except for the period December 1834—April 1835, when a short-lived Tory cabinet led by Wellington and Peel held office, was now thoroughly prejudiced against the Pasha of Egypt. ‘For my part,’ he wrote in June 1839, ‘I hate Mehemet Ali, whom I consider as nothing but an ignorant barbarian, who by cunning and boldness and mother-wit has been successful in rebellion. ... I look upon his boasted civilization of Egypt as the arrantest humbug; and I believe that he is as great a tyrant and oppressor as ever made a people wretched.’! He would have been glad to see the Pasha lose Syria and perhaps Egypt itself. But he realised how urgently the Ottoman Empire needed to reform and modernise itself if it were to remain an important power or even to continue to exist. He was very anxious, therefore, to avoid a new conflict in the Near East until the Turks were stronger. In September 1834 he even ordered the British Mediterranean squadron to turn back the Turkish fleet if it seemed about to attack the Egyptian one. In April 1837 he unhesitatingly rejected a proposal from Mahmud for an Anglo—Turkish alliance against Mohammed Ali. Palmerston’s caution was not shared by Ponsonby, the energetic but headstrong British ambassador to the Porte, who had arrived in Constantinople in May 1833. He urged more than once (notably in October 1835) that Mohammed Ali’s power was a standing threat to the existence

1834-6 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 of the Ottoman Empire. Even a new defeat for the Turkish armies,
he argued, would be less dangerous than the maintenance of the
status quo. Palmerston, however, was rightly unmoved by these
pleadings. Russia for her part had now achieved a satisfactory relationship with Turkey. At Unkiar-Skelessi she had, she believed, established a kind of de facto protectorate, or potential protectorate, over the Ottoman Empire. By the mid-1830s all obvious sources of dispute between the two states were rapidly disappearing. A final settlement of the new Russo—Turkish frontier in the Caucasus, agreed on at Adrianople, was achieved by a convention of January 1834. New and milder arrangements were made by another convention of May 1836 for the payment by Turkey of the war indemnity inflicted on her in 1829. A month or two later the Russians evacuated Silistria, which they had been holding for the last seven years as security for the sum owed them. A new Turco—Egyptian war would either make Mahmud II strong enough to assert his independence of Russian tutelage or establish at the Straits a new and vigorous ruler in the person of Mohammed Ali. In either case Russia must lose. After 1833 therefore she consistently upheld the status quo in the Near East. Nor were the other great powers anxious to see new disturbances there. Metternich, apart from his unwillingness to see the power of a legitimate ruler once more defied by his vassal, feared the possibilities of international friction inherent in fresh struggles in the Levant. French public opinion was already showing signs of the pro-Egyptian attitude which was to be so important and threatening in 1840; but as yet this had no effect on the attitude of French statesmen. In May 1836 Roussin was ordered to uphold the Kutiah settlement since ‘all Europe wants the maintenance of the status quo in the East’.1 The desire of Britain and Russia to avoid new complications in the Levant did not mean that relations between them had improved. Far from recovering from the shock of Unkiar-Skelessi, these relations deteriorated sharply in the years which followed. Palmerston remained convinced that Russian expansionism was a threat to the existence of the Ottoman Empire and extremely anxious to oppose it. In January 1834 Ponsonby was empowered to summon the British Mediterranean squadron to the Straits if its presence there seemed necessary to oppose a Russian seizure of Constantinople, though the Dardanelles were not to be forced against Turkish opposition without instructions from London.

the ambassador of this power in March 1835; but it was restored by Palmerston in June 1836. (Though Ponsonby was now to act only if the summoning of the British fleet were asked for by the Sultan.) The British Foreign Secretary’s distrust of Russia can also be seen in his proposal, in November 1835, of a Franco—British treaty with Turkey to protect the latter against the Russians, a proposal which was nullified by the lukewarmness of the other members of the British cabinet and the refusal of France to cooperate. Moreover, quite apart from the threat of Russian dominance at Constantinople and even of a Russian seizure of the Straits there was now a whole series of other issues on which Britain and Russia were at loggerheads. The growth of the Russian fleet seemed to many Englishmen a threat to their country’s security (Palmerston thought it the most dangerous factor in the whole complex of Anglo—Russian relations) and in 1833 and 1838 British naval strength was increased to meet this rather unreal peril. In Persia by the later 1830s British suspicions of Russian influence were becoming acute. The Persian attack in 1837 on the fortress of Herat in eastern Afghanistan, widely regarded as one of the keys to India, was made with Russian encouragement, while a British officer directed the successful defence of the city. In the spring of 1839 the government of India became involved in a quite unnecessary war with the Emir Dost Mohammed of Afghanistan provoked by fears of a growth of Russian influence there. More directly relevant to the position in the Near East was the question of Circassia. The efforts of the Russians after 1829 to subdue the inaccessible areas populated by Cherkess tribes on the east coast of the Black Sea gave great opportunities to anti-Russian propagandists in Britain. ‘The Russian Empire seemed once more, as in Poland, to be crushing a people struggling to be free. In the process it appeared to be strengthening dangerously its position in the Caucasus and thus its ability to move against the Ottoman Empire, Persia or even India. In 1834 Ponsonby proposed that British men-of-war be sent to the Black Sea to support the Circassians. Nothing came of so dangerous and impracticable an idea. But during the next two years the British government made considerable efforts to obtain accurate information about the position in Circassia, notably from James Hudson, who was sent there as a special investigator at the end of 1835, and from James Yeames, the consul-general at Odessa, who visited the area during the summer of 1836. Above all in 1834 David Urquhart, a young, passionate and mystical Scot who was soon to become a fanatical Russophobe propagandist of European significance, visited Circassia. He was to be henceforth one of the staunchest and most

1834-9 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 uncritical supporters of its semi-barbaric inhabitants. In September
1834 he suggested that they should declare their independence and
ask Great Britain for help in maintaining it — a suggestion which Palmerston at once rejected. Two years later the potential dangers of the position were shown when in November 1836 a British ship, the Vixen, was seized by the Russians (who had proclaimed a blockade of the Circassian coast) in the port of Sudjuk-Kalé. This did not produce the serious Anglo—Russian crisis for which Urquhart, who had organised the sending of the ship to Circassia, had hoped. The Russians soon released her crew; and though Palmerston refused to accept Russia’s claims to sovereignty over Circassia he admitted that she was rightfully in possession of Sudjuk-Kalé. Russian officials were therefore, he agreed, entitled to seize the Vixen because of her infringement of ‘municipal’ or quarantine regulations for the port. On this basis the incident had been settled by June 1837. Palmerston, though he had no desire for a head-on collision with Russia, was increasingly impressed by the need to strengthen the Ottoman Empire and thus enable it to resist pressure either from Russia or from Egypt. He had no wish for any fundamental overhaul of the social and political structure of the empire. He did not wish to give its subjects parliamentary or representative government; this would have been an impracticable and indeed a ludicrous ambition. What he wanted was simply to strengthen its armed forces and its fiscal and administrative structure. The later 1830s saw him make a number of unsuccessful efforts in this direction. Several British officers were sent to Turkey in 1835-6 to improve the organisation of its army and gather information about the empire’s military potentialities. In September 1838 a Turkish squadron joined the British Mediterranean fleet for a training cruise in the Levant and in March 1839 a small group of British naval officers arrived at Constantinople to improve the training of the Turkish navy. All this achieved very little. The employment of British army officers in Turkey was naturally enough objected to by the Russian government; and the Turks, who had already Austrian and Prussian officers at their disposal, could not or would not find much for these unsolicited British helpers to do. Most of them, like all but one of the naval
officers despatched in 1839, soon returned home having accom
plished nothing. Religious prejudices, which made it impossible to
give Christians effective command over Moslem soldiers, meant that
the Turks benefited much less than they might have done from the

It was with affairs in this position — with Anglo—Russian tension high and tending to increase, with the Ottoman Empire still unreformed and its fighting forces still inefficient, with Mahmud IT still in search of revenge — that the Levant, and therefore all Europe, moved towards a new crisis.
The Pasha of Egypt had already thought of proclaiming his independence during the autumn of 1834 but had been discouraged by Ibrahim who believed, probably correctly, that the best chance of doing this had been lost during the critical first months of 1833. Early in 1838 Mohammed Ali began to raise the question more seriously, since his increasing age made him anxious to establish

a permanent position for his family as soon as possible. He sounded the consuls in Egypt as to the attitude of their governments, and on 25 May announced his intention to proclaim himself an independent ruler. The powers were immediately and unanimously hostile to this alteration of the Near Eastern status quo. On 24 May, before he knew of Mohammed Ali’s action, Palmerston had suggested to Esterhazy, the Austrian ambassador in London, that the great powers should co-operate to oppose the Pasha if he declared his independence. Nesselrode, after a meeting between Nicholas I and Metternich at Téplitz in Bohemia, issued a declaration welcoming any measures Britain and France might take against Egypt, while large-scale preparations were made in Russia for a seizure of the Straits in case of a new Turco—-Egyptian war.t The French government, though it was already more favourable to Mohammed Ali than that of any other great power, ordered Cochelet, its consul in Egypt, to impress on the Pasha the urgent need not to upset the status quo. Clearly he had miscalculated. On 16 July, in an audience given to Campbell and Medem, the British and Russian consuls, he withdrew his declaration. But he made it quite clear that he had not given up the idea of independence; its declaration had been postponed but certainly not abandoned for ever. This minor crisis in the summer of 1838 showed that it would be increasingly difficult for Russia to maintain her pretensions to a semi-protectorate over the Ottoman Empire. In August Palmerston tried to organise some co-operation on Near Eastern affairs between all five of the great powers. He hoped that a new treaty, replacing that of Unkiar-Skelessi and placing Turkey under some sort of collective guarantee, might be negotiated by their ambassadors in London. His hopes proved vain, largely because of Russian opposition; but in a despatch of 10 October to Lord Clanricarde, the British ambassador in St. Petersburg, he stressed the impossibility of the fate of the Ottoman Empire being decided ‘by the single, independent and self-regulated interference of any one Power, acting according to its own will or without concert with any other Power’.? Russia was now, in essentials, isolated in the Near East. France was by no means so hostile to her as Britain; but a Franco—Russian agreement was quite impossible. It would imply Russian support for France in
1 Russia had, however, less reason than Britain to oppose a declaration of Egyptian independence, since it seemed that the more serious the Egyptian threat to Turkey the more complete Turkish subordination to Russia must become. Ponsonby, typically enough, suspected that the Russians had encouraged Mohammed Ali to seek independence. 2 Sir C. K.

the affairs of Belgium and hence separate Russia from Austria and Prussia. It was strongly opposed by powerful influences in the Russian Foreign Ministry, led by Nesselrode himself, while Nicholas I had a very low opinion of the reliability of France as an ally. Metternich had little personal interest in the Near East and Austria could not be relied on to support a Russian seizure of Constantinople or the creation of an effective Russian protectorate over the Ottoman Empire. Thus the position of Russia, which appeared in London so strong and so threatening, was weaker than it seemed. By the beginning of 1839 it was clear that she could not hope to exclude Britain from influence over the Turkish government any more than Britain could hope to exclude her. The way was thus being opened for some modus vivendi between the two states. By the later months of 1838 Mahmud II was more determined than ever to settle accounts with Mohammed Ali. Mustapha Reschid Pasha, the Turkish Minister of Foreign Affairs, was sent on a special mission to Vienna, Berlin, Paris and London in a last effort to obtain the support of the powers for action against the Pasha; but in vain. Palmerston, whose attitude on this point counted for more than that of any other European statesman, was willing to promise aid to the Sultan only if Mohammed Ali should declare his independence. An Anglo—Turkish alliance, to him, was to be an instrument for the maintenance of stability in the Near East not, as Mahmud hoped, for the reconquest of Syria. The Sultan, however, now in very poor health, was irrevocably determined to overthrow his Egyptian vassal, with or without the support of Europe. In April 1839 Palmerston’s terms for a British alliance were rejected. Almost simultaneously a Turkish army crossed the frontier into Mohammed Ali’s dominions and a new Turco—Egyptian war began. Within a matter of weeks the Ottoman Empire seemed on the point of collapse. On 24 June the Turks were overwhelmingly defeated by Ibrahim Pasha at Nizib in northern Syria. Only orders from his father, who showed himself as cautious as ever in the exploitation of his son’s victories, prevented the successful general from crossing the Taurus and advancing on Koniah. On 30 June, before news of the battle had reached him, Mahmud II died. His successor, Abdul Medjid, was a boy of sixteen, and a weak and stupid one at that. A week later the Kapudan Pasha, Ahmad Mushir, with the bulk of the Turkish fleet, sailed to Alexandria and
joined Mohammed Ali (possibly because he feared that the ships
might otherwise be placed under Russian control by the Grand
Vizier, Husrev Pasha, who was a bitter enemy of the Egyptian
ruler). Near-panic now prevailed in Constantinople. On 5 July the
95


1839 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 new Sultan offered Mohammed Ali hereditary possession of Egypt;
but this was met by a demand for the same concession in Syria and
Adana and for the dismissal of Husrev — terms which would have
dealt a death-blow to the fictitious unity of the Ottoman Empire. If the powers did not intervene the Porte would be compelled to surrender to Mohammed Ali’s demands. But there were already clear signs that they would intervene. On 25 June Palmerston gave orders for the British Mediterranean fleet to cut all sea communication between Egypt and Syria. Part of it was to go to Alexandria and there give ‘positive orders’ for an immediate suspension of hostilities. In this it was to have the naval backing of France. Also the first weeks of the crisis saw the rapid formation of.a Near Eastern entente between the great powers. Britain and France agreed (as they had not done in 1832-3) that Vienna should become the centre of negotiation. The result of this, and of the dislike felt by all the powers for any alteration of the status quo in the Levant, was quick and effective action to save Turkey from the effects of her disasters. On 27 July, just as the Ottoman ministers had decided to concede Mohammed Ali’s demands, the ambassadors in Constantinople of the five great powers presented to the Porte a vitally important collective note. This asserted that ‘agreement among the Five Great Powers on the Question of the East is secured’, and invited the Turkish government to ‘suspend any definitive resolution without their concurrence, waiting for the effect of the interest which these powers feel for it’. On 22 August the Porte, in effect, asked the powers to make a settlement on its behalf with Mohammed Ali, stipulating merely that it would not cede Syria to him. This altered the entire situation. The Turco—Egyptian war was now declared to be an object of European interest. Mohammed Ali was not to be allowed to exploit his victories to the full, or perhaps at all. When on 25 August he belatedly ordered his son to advance on Koniah Ibrahim refused, pleading the exhaustion of his army and the danger of an anti-Egyptian revolt in Syria. There was thus a prolonged interval during which there was no fighting of significance. For nearly a year the focus of interest was to be the diplomacy of the European states rather than events in the Near East. The common front which the powers had established by the end of July was still much more apparent than real. The British government remained very distrustful of Russia; and on 18 July Palmerston had ordered Ponsonby to summon the British fleet to enter the Dardanelles if the Russian one entered the Bosphorus ‘upon any pretext or for any reason whatever’. Much more important, however, was 1 Puryear, op. cit., p. 154.

1 Much British exploratory and surveying work on the overland route was done in 1835-42 (see H. L. Hoskins, British Routes to India (New York, 1928), chap. vii passim). One of Mohammed Ali’s generals, Kurshid Pasha, did in fact march
through central Arabia to the Persian Gulf in 1839 and announced his intention
of seizing the island of Bahrein. Henry Ellis, a leading member of the Board of
Control for India, had feared as early as January 1833 that Mohammed Ali might
unite with the Russians to partition Persia and that Egypt might become an
important naval power in the Indian Ocean, (M. Vereté, ‘Palmerston and the
Levant Crisis, 1832’, Journal ofModern History, xxiv (1952), P- 149-)

moment for Russia. In London, Paris and Vienna she was represented merely by chargés d’affaires. Nicholas I was preoccupied by family affairs. Above all the country’s financial position was bad; as so often during the nineteenth century lack of money set limits to what Russian foreign policy could hope to achieve. Thus the Tsar and his ministers did not want to give military help to the Turks as they might be called upon to do under the terms of the treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi. In two reports to Nicholas of 9 August 1839 Nesselrode urged that Russia should co-operate with the other powers in some international guarantee of the integrity of Turkish territory, provided that there were no interference with the principle that the Straits should be closed in peace-time to ships of war. The Tsar accepted this conclusion and decided in September to send Baron E. P. Brunnow, Russian minister at Stuttgart, on a special mission to London to seek agreement with Britain along these lines. With this decision Russian policy became a decisive factor in the march of events. A special Russian representative was sent only to London partly because Britain was the most important of Russia’s potential enemies in the Near East, the power which it was most important to conciliate. Nicholas and Nesselrode were also piqued by the independent attitude which Austria had taken up during the crisis and anxious to exclude her from these preliminary negotiations. Above all they realised that by negotiating with Britain alone they might be able to break the Anglo—French entente which, though often severely strained, had been a leading factor in European politics during the 1830s, notably in the Iberian peninsula and to some extent in Belgium. To destroy it would be a great victory for the cause of conservatism in Europe. For such a victory Nicholas was willing to pay a considerable price. Brunnow arrived in London in mid-September and found Palmerston very receptive to his proposals. From the start he made it clear that if a Russian fleet had to be sent to Constantinople to defend the Sultan against his vassal this would not imply a Russian protectorate over the Ottoman Empire of the sort envisaged in 1833. Russia, if she intervened, would do so as the representative of Europe and not for any selfish purpose of her own. The treaty of UnkiarSkelessi would not be renewed when it expired in 1841; Russia would be willing to make some collective arrangement with the other great powers regarding the fate of Turkey and Egypt. In return Britain and France must accept the closure of the Straits to warships in

THE SECOND MOHAMMED ALI CRISIS 1839-40 time of peace as a principle of European public law. All this made very welcome hearing to Palmerston; he also agreed that Mohammed Ali should be driven from Syria, and perhaps even from Egypt if he ordered Ibrahim to attack Asia Minor. But the course of the negotiations was not altogether smooth. Liberal opinion in Britain was increasingly hostile to the idea of co-operation with Russia on any issue whatever. Palmerston now found himself faced by a powerful pro-French faction in the cabinet which was unwilling to desert the state which had for years been Britain’s only powerful friend in Europe. Feelings of this kind were to impede his diplomacy throughout the critical months which followed. Brunnow therefore left London on 1 October to report in St. Petersburg on his achievements without having arrived at any formal agreement with the British government. These Anglo—Russian negotiations aroused a good deal of uneasiness in France. But they did nothing to modify the increasingly proEgyptian attitude of the French government. Both Louis-Philippe and Marshal Soult, his Prime Minister, refused to listen to any suggestion that force should be used to drive Mohammed Ali from Syria. When, early in October, Palmerston attempted a compromise by suggesting that the Egyptians might retain the Pashalik of Acre without the fortress-city of that name this proposal was rejected out of hand in Paris. From early in September Sébastiani, the French ambassador in London, had been warning his government that Britain was determined to coerce Mohammed Ali if necessary; but his despatches had little effect. The breach between Britain and France was becoming more and more obvious. “he Anglo-French alliance is already dead,’ wrote Brunnow exultantly on 24 November. ‘England is still not with us; but neither is she with France.... England is a widow. To marry her much skill and patience are needed, for she is a handsome and capricious woman.’ Less than a month later he was once more in London, this time as Russian ambassador. Apart from the interruption of the Crimean War years he was to hold the post until 1873. Together with Neumann, the special Austrian envoy whom Metternich had just sent to Britain, he quickly reached agreement with Palmerston on the essentials of a solution to the Turco—Egyptian problem. On 5 January 1840 the British Foreign Secretary was able to tell Sébastiani that Britain and Russia agreed that Mohammed Ali must be confined to Egypt and that on this point they had the support of Austria and Prussia. A fortnight later Palmerston presented to

1840 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
Brunnow and Neumann a draft convention embodying a settlement
of the Egyptian question. Two of its articles dealt with the Straits
and negotiations on the new regime to be established there went on for several months.
Meanwhile the fall of the Soult government and its replacement
in March by that led by Adolphe Thiers made the attitude of France
still more uncompromising and unrealistic. Neither Soult nor Thiers
ever said precisely what they felt should be ceded to Mohammed Ali. They persistently rejected the suggestions of the powers for a Near Eastern settlement and yet put forward no real alternative of their own. Moreover Thiers greatly exaggerated the ability of the Pasha to hold out against the hostility of Europe, while Palmerston realised that France, however violent the language of her leaders, would not go to war merely to uphold his power in Syria. The attitude of France meant an intensification of the crisis. On 7 April Nuri-Effendi, the Turkish plenipotentiary, presented in London a note which demanded that the powers carry out the implied promise to protect Turkish interests which they had made in the collective note of 27 July 1839. Mohammed Ali could be given hereditary possession of Egypt; but in return he must surrender the Turkish fleet and give up all his other territories. At the end of May Chekib-Effendi, a newly-arrived Turkish envoy to London, once more demanded an early solution to the problem. In spite of appeals from Guizot, the new French ambassador in London, Thiers refused to change his attitude or negotiate seriously with the powers. Early in May Neumann proposed, with the reluctant assent of Palmerston, that the Egyptians should be left with all Syria south of a line from Beyrut to Lake Tiberias (which would have given them the great fortress of Acre). But this surprisingly generous offer aroused no response in Paris. On 12 June Neumann, in conversation with Guizot, even suggested that Mohammed Ali might retain the whole of Syria during his lifetime; but on the 30th Thiers, in spite of the arguments of Guizot in favour of accepting this proposal, refused to settle for anything less than hereditary possession of the whole of Syria by the Pasha. Matters were brought to a head by the fall, on 7 July, of the
Grand Vizier Husrev Pasha, who had been throughout the crisis the
most anti-Egyptian of the Turkish ministers. Mohammed Ali had
already been negotiating somewhat half-heartedly with the Porte
for several months. He knew that there were influences in Constanti
nople which favoured him, notably that of the Sultan’s mother, and
now attempted to take advantage of the changed situation by
sending a new emissary, Sami Bey, to the Turkish capital. Through
100


THE SECOND MOHAMMED ALI CRISIS 1840
him he offered to restore the Turkish fleet; in return he must be allowed to keep all the territory he had conquered, with hereditary possession of Syria. It seemed suddenly that the careful negotiations of the last six months or more in London might be brought to nothing by a direct Turco—Egyptian agreement which would certainly be supported by France. The powers could not accept such a humiliation. Largely through the influence of Ponsonby the Porte decisively rejected Mohammed Ali’s proposals on 12 July. Three days later Britain, Russia, Austria and Prussia signed in London with Chekib-Effendi a series of agreements for the regulation of Near Eastern affairs. First of all a convention provided for the protection by the powers of the Sultan against his rebellious vassal. In return Abdul Medyjid was to declare explicitly that henceforth the Straits would be closed in peace-time to the warships of all foreign states. By a separate act annexed to the convention Mohammed Ali, if he submitted to the Sultan within ten days of receiving the offer, was to be left with hereditary tenure of Egypt and possession of southern Syria for his lifetime. If he did not accept within ten days he might still retain his hereditary tenure of Egypt; but after twenty days the Sultan could withdraw even this more limited offer. ‘The laws of the Ottoman Empire were to apply in whatever dominions Mohammed Ali might be allowed to retain. His army and navy were to be part of the Turkish forces and he was to surrender the Turkish fleet. Finally the powers agreed by another separate protocol that action might be taken against Egypt before the principal convention had been ratified, and that its terms were not to be disclosed to the French government. These agreements meant that the effort to find a solution acceptable to France, which had taken so much time and trouble in the last six months, had been abandoned. The French press was by now violently anti-British and Thiers still refused to give way. ‘I fear nothing,’ he wrote on 16 July. ‘We shall face anything with a country like ours.’! Guizot, he went on, should be ‘always cold, mysterious, unshakeable’. Mohammed Ali must consolidate his position in Syria and Egypt by all possible means and defy the powers to evict him. His own strength and their inevitable divisions would bring him victory in the long run. This advice seemed plausible. Cochelet, the French consul in Egypt, was very optimistic about the Pasha’s ability to resist pressure, even armed attack, by the European powers. Moreover these powers were indeed lacking in unity. Palmerston had forced the British cabinet to accept the

IOI


1840 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 convention of 15 July only by a threat of resignation if it did not do so. Two of its members, Lords Holland and Clarendon, refused to the last to agree to alliance with Russia against France, though they did not resign over the issue. The violent French reaction to the convention alarmed several members of the government
— there were fears of a French attack on Malta or the Balearics — and led to pressure for conciliatory approaches to Paris. By the end of September even Queen Victoria favoured some concession to France, while popular hostility to Russia remained as strong as ever. The Prussian government ratified the convention only on the understanding that it did not oblige Prussia to use force against Mohammed Ali. Metternich, whose Near Eastern policy during the previous months had been very vacillating, also showed himself half-hearted about enforcing the convention. In September he proposed that Mohammed Ali be left as ruler of Syria for his lifetime. Even in Russia Nesselrode would probably have accepted some concession to France; only the Tsar stood firm on the terms of the convention. Yet the situation was saved and the convention of 15 July carried out in its essentials. This was partly because of the determination of Palmerston and still more because Mohammed Ali’s position was far weaker than it appeared. In June a revolt against Egyptian rule broke out in the Lebanon. It was not the work of British agents in the Levant, as many Frenchmen and Egyptians wished to believe, though Niven Moore, the British consul in Beyrut, and his brother-in-law Richard Wood, certainly encouraged anti-Egyptian feeling in the area. It was a genuine movement of protest against the regime of Ibrahim Pasha provoked by his efforts to disarm the Maronite Christians and by fears that he meant to conscript the Lebanese as soldiers for his army.1 By the end of July it had been crushed. But it had shown unmistakably the weakness of the Egyptian position in Syria. A clear-sighted French diplomat, Count Walewski, who landed in Egypt on 12 August on a special mission, reported very unfavourably on Mohammed Ali’s prospects. The Pasha, he wrote, had no means of resisting British naval attack on his fleet or his capital. If he were faced by such an attack, or by serious revolt in Syria or the landing of European forces there, he would probably react by a renewed advance into Asia Minor with unpredictable consequences. Events were soon to show that this pessimistic estimate of the position was justified. Almost from the moment the four-power convention was signed

THE SECOND MOHAMMED ALI CRISIS 1840 Palmerston had been urging Admiral Stopford, the elderly and cautious commander of the British Mediterranean fleet, to act effectively against the Egyptian forces in Syria. He also attempted, with success, to heap fuel on the fires of revolt in the Lebanon. On 11 September Beyrut was bombarded by the British fleet and Turkish soldiers, supported by British marines, were landed in the neighbourhood.! Three days later the Porte, inspired by Ponsonby, proclaimed the deposition of Mohammed Ali. A guerrilla war against the Egyptians now broke out in the Lebanon. Nearly 22,000 British muskets were distributed to its inhabitants and on 5 October the Emir Beshir, the leading notable of the area who had hitherto supported Ibrahim, recognised the Sultan as his sovereign. On the 1oth Ibrahim was defeated at Beit-Hannis by Admiral Napier, Stopford’s second-in-command, and Beyrut fell. Above all Acre was captured with remarkable ease, after a British naval bombardment, on 4 November. This cut the communications of Ibrahim’s forces, which had been concentrated in the Damascus area, and forced him to evacuate the whole of Syria. The Egyptian army, unpaid for months, demoralised and unpopular, could not hope to maintain its hold on the province. Palmerston meanwhile did everything he could to strengthen the Turks, supplying them with arms and with medical and comissariat officers. After a difficult retreat through Palestine Ibrahim evacuated Gaza, his last foothold in the province, on 18 February 1841, and returned to Egypt. The fruit of Koniah, of Nisib, of such expenditure of money and effort, had been lost in a few months, essentially in a few weeks. Before the Egyptians evacuated Syria the bases of a settlement had been reached. As early as 6 September, before fighting began in the Lebanon, Mohammed Ali sent an envoy, Rifaat Bey, to the Sultan asking only for hereditary possession of Egypt and offering to rely merely on Abdul Medjid’s generosity for any further concessions which might be made to him. He thus, in effect, accepted the provisions of the convention of 15July. It had been clear throughout that he could not be expelled from Egypt. To do this would require a dangerously large exertion of British strength; and Thiers argued plausibly in a note of 8 October that the deposition of the Pasha would overthrow the existing Near Eastern balance of power. Though Ponsonby, violent and headstrong as ever, wished to deprive Mohammed Ali of all his territories, Palmerston had never envisaged this as a serious possibility. On 15 October he urged, in a despatch
1 Mohammed Ali had received on 6 August news of the convention of 15 July; it could therefore be argued that the twenty-day time limit for his acceptance of the terms offered him had expired on 5 September.

1840-1 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 to the ambassador, that Mohammed Ali be left with hereditary
possession of Egypt if he submitted to the Sultan. Twelve days later
he suggested that this might be limited to the lifetimes of Mohammed
Ali and Ibrahim; but this restriction was impracticable. On, the
other hand the Egyptians had now lost any remaining hope of active
support from France. On 21 October Louis-Philippe, alarmed by the humiliating isolation into which Thiers had led the country, forced him to resign. His cabinet was succeeded by one led ostensibly by the aged Soult but in fact by Guizot, who as ambassador in London had tried unsuccessfully to moderate Thiers’s pro-Egyptian attitude. ‘The retirement of M. Thiers and his colleagues from office’, wrote Palmerston on 27 October, ‘is a sure pledge to Europe that France is not going to make war in defence of Mehemet Ali.’! Guizot continued to press for the retention of Syria by the Pasha; and some members of the British cabinet, notably Lord Clarendon, continued to be willing to accept this. But France was now more than ever playing a losing game. The defeats which the Egyptians suffered in Syria did much to strengthen the determination of Metternich to oppose them and Mohammed Ali knew well how weak his position now was. On 27 November, therefore, he signed with Admiral Napier a convention which gave him relatively favourable terms. He was to withdraw his forces from Syria; but in return he was granted an immediate armistice, which protected Ibrahim’s retreating army from British and Turkish attack. He was to surrender the Turkish fleet and submit to the Sultan as his overlord; in return he was to have hereditary possession of Egypt. By signing the convention the Pasha disregarded the great efforts which Cochelet was making to persuade him to ask for French intervention. For the time being at least any special Franco—Egyptian relationship was at an end. Ponsonby, who still wished to drive the Pasha and his family from Egypt, thought that Napier (who admired Mohammed Ali) had been far too generous; but Palmerston and the anti-Egyptian powers in general were willing to accept in substance, if not in all its details, the agreement of 27 November. It provided the basis of a permanent Turco—Egyptian settlement. On 8-g December the Pasha had an interview with another British officer, Captain Fanshawe, and agreed once more to return the Turkish fleet and evacuate all his territories except Egypt. In January 1841 he returned the Turkish fleet to the Sultan; while a hatti-sherif of 13 February made the government of Egypt hereditary in his family. Complete agreement, however, was still delayed for some months. The hatti-sherif em1 Temperley, op. cit., p. 131.

powered the Sultan to choose which of Mohammed Ali’s sons should succeed him. It also limited the size of his army, forbade him to build warships without the Sultan’s permission, and provided that all Turkish laws were to apply in Egypt and that a quarter of the gross revenues of the country must be paid to the Sultan. These restrictions on his power, which Ponsonby’s attitude had encouraged the Sultan to impose, Mohammed Ali refused to accept. In this refusal he was encouraged by Napier. Palmerston, now anxious to have matters settled, insisted on concessions being made by the Porte. So did Metternich; and on 10 June 1841 Mohammed Ali accepted new and more favourable terms offered him a few days earlier. His army was still limited and he still needed the Sultan’s permission to build warships; but the succession in Egypt was now to be governed by primogeniture and the tribute to be paid to Constantinople was fixed at forty million piastres a year. Mohammed Ali had failed, in spite of some striking successes, to build the ‘Arab Empire’ in the Near East of which he and Ibrahim had dreamed. In part this was because of international factors which he could not control or even much influence. By exposing once more the weakness of the Ottoman Empire he had raised questions which there was a general unwillingness in Europe to face. He had incurred, in varying degrees, the hostility of most of the major European powers. Above all, as the more or less unwitting pretext for Russian attempts at domination at Constantinople he had aroused, from 1833 onwards, the unappeasable dislike and distrust of Palmerston. France, his only supporter, had misled and misadvised him. She had grossly overestimated his real strength and proved quite unable to protect him against the hostility of the other great powers, above all against that of Britain. These factors alone doomed his ephemeral empire to collapse. And their effect was increased by other and perhaps more fundamental ones. His regime in Syria was never popular or profitable to him,! and he overstrained the resources of Egypt in attempting to maintain a large army and build a powerful navy. The social and economic foundations of his empire were too weak to sustain for long the burdens he placed upon them, as his constant lack of money and the unpaid condition of his army by 1840 clearly showed. He jolted Egypt, often brutally, out of the stagnation which had been her lot for generations. He established there a dynasty which was to endure, very ingloriously,

for a century. He did something, in 1832-40, to spread western
ideas and practices of a technical and utilitarian kind in Syria. But his international ambitions ended in decisive failure. Palmerston had wished to accelerate the final agreement between Mohammed Ali and the Porte mainly because the lack of one was delaying the conclusion of a formal international agreement on the Straits. The Anglo-French breach which had opened during the last year was papered over, though by no means completely healed, from November 1840 onwards. By 13 February 1841 Guizot had agreed to join the other powers in guaranteeing the closure of the Straits to non-Turkish warships in time of peace; on 15 March Bourqueney, the new French ambassador in London, initialled a convention to this effect. On 13 June 1841 a formal agreement was signed by Britain, Russia, Austria, Prussia and a France now formally reconciled with her former opponents. In essence it reiterated the provisions regarding the Straits of the four-power convention of 15 July 1840. The Sultan declared his intention of maintaining “the ancient rule of the Ottoman Empire’ by which foreign warships were forbidden to enter the Straits while the Porte was at peace.! This declaration was formally accepted by the powers as binding on them and the ‘regime of the Straits’ thus established was to be an important element in the public law of Europe for the rest of the century. By the Straits Convention of 1841 Palmerston achieved his overriding aim in the Near East — the destruction of the threateningly privileged position vzs-d-vis the Ottoman Empire which Russia seemed to have won in 1833. As far as control of or passage through the Straits were concerned, she was now on a footing of mere equality with the other powers of Europe. This was no real loss to her. The semi-protectorate over the Ottoman Empire which Russian statesmen thought they had established in 1833 had always been a fiction. Its existence had never been admitted by the Porte and it could not have been exercised in practice without the gravest danger of war, a danger which neither Nesselrode nor Nicholas I was willing to run. Moreover the convention of 1841, though it destroyed any prospect of free passage through the Straits into the Mediterranean for Russian men-of-war, meant that while the Turks were at peace no British or French warships could enter the Black
* Whether the Sultan on his own authority could disregard this rule, at least to the extent of allowing individual warships to pass through the Straits, was not discussed. The question was later to become a controversial one (see pp. 21 5-16). Small warships employed in the service of embassies of friendly states were exempted from the rule of closure.

Sea. The measure of security which this gave the Russian Black Sea coastline was, it is true, not very great. In any future Anglo—Russian or Franco—Russian war the Ottoman Empire would probably sooner or later be involved; and as early as 6 August 1841 Palmerston was arguing that the convention would not debar the Porte from calling for naval help from Britain ‘to maintain tranquillity in the capital’. But it was not negligible. Certainly it was well worth the loss of the vague and disputed ‘rights’ which Russia might claim to have acquired in 1833. “The treaty of Unkiar—Skelessi,’ wrote Nesselrode a decade later with a good deal of exaggeration, ‘though annulled to all appearance, has been really perpetuated under another form. The new act, which has replaced it and been recognised by all the powers, forbids foreign warships to enter the Dardanelles, and assures us henceforth against all naval attack’.? The disruption of the AngloFrench entente of the 1830s, again, was a great success for Russian diplomacy, though one to which the obstinacy of Thiers had contributed more than the skill of Brunnow. For the next decade, and especially in the early 1840s, France rather than Russia was to appear to statesmen in London the main threat to British influence in the Near East. The years after 1841 see a noticeable slackening of the tension which so constantly afflicted the area during the previous two decades. The ambitions of Mohammed Ali were not totally extinguished by the defeat of 1840. He hoped to have Said Pasha, his younger son, made ruler of the Pashalik of Sidon, and tried to take advantage for this purpose of the struggle between Maronites and Druses which broke out in the Lebanon in October 1841. In August 1846 he visited Constantinople in person and spent immense sums on presents to Turkish ministers and courtiers in an effort to increase his influence there. But none of this had any result. Long before his death in August 1849 (Ibrahim had died eight months earlier) Egypt had lost the international importance which he had given it, or thrust upon it, in 1825-41. But the decline of the Ottoman Empire, or at least its failure to keep pace with the developing states of Europe, continued throughout the 1840s. More drastic efforts than ever before were now being made to modernise the empire. In 1839, as the Porte reeled under the disasters which the new war with Egypt had brought, an unprecedented effort at systematic reform had been made. The hattrsherif of Ghulané, issued on 3 November, provided for new legislation
to guarantee security of life and property and the drawing up of a

1839-45 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
penal code. The taxation system was to be reformed and the army
recruited henceforth from the Christian as well as the Moslem
subjects of the Porte. This was followed by other, almost equally
important, reforms. In December 1839 it was decreed that provincial
governors should henceforth be paid regular salaries and promoted on merit —a change which, if carried out, would have revolutionised the administrative system. In May 1840 the promised new penal code, based on French precedents, purported to establish equality before the law for all Ottoman subjects regardless of race or faith — an innovation which struck at the whole traditional basis of the empire. These reforms had little practical effect. They were the work of a small number of progressive and partly-westernised officials, above all of Mustafa Reschid Pasha, the Foreign Minister. But as far as most Turks of the official class were concerned the main function of this legislation was merely to help win for the empire in the crisis of 1839-40 the support of the great European powers. Once this had been achieved the reforms could be allowed to fall into oblivion. Against any serious change was arrayed a vast and still almost invincible body of prejudice, vested interests and unthinking conservatism. By March 1841, with the safety of the empire ensured for the time being, Reschid had been dismissed and packed off as ambassador to Paris. For the next few years conservative and antiforeign influences were in the saddle at Constantinople and the Ghulané reforms were abandoned. In practice only an increase in the size and cost of the army (but without any enrolment of Christians) and some currency reform were achieved. This did not destroy the impulse to reform which Reschid symbolised. He returned to power in 1845. In the following year a committee put forward proposals for a sweeping development of education. A commercial code based on French law was adopted in 1850. But proposals and even achievements of this kind touched little more than the surface of the problem. Their effect on the life and thinking of the ordinary man in Turkey, Moslem or Christian, ethnically Turkish or not, was slight. It must be remembered, moreover, how limited the aims of these
reforms were even to their promoters. They were not intended to
introduce greater political or intellectual liberty, or any sort of
representative government, into the Ottoman Empire. They were
not even meant to increase the powers of the Sultan in any direct or
important way, though this was their effect. What Reschid and
those who thought like him really wished to do was to improve the
efficiency and status of the Turkish bureaucracy. Their ambitions
108


THE SECOND MOHAMMED ALI CRISIS 1839-45
centred on the creation of an official class which would be more competent, better educated and above all more independent than that which the Ottoman Empire already possessed. This was a limited, in some ways even a conservative, aim; it is significant that Metternich was the first European statesman to congratulate Reschid on the issue of the hatti-sherif of Ghulané.

1841-56
THE crisis of 1839-41 had failed to halt the disintegration which the Ottoman Empire had for so long been undergoing. Nor did it succeed in ending the antagonisms of the great powers in the Near East. Their rivalries, though considerably muted during most of the 1840s, were far from being destroyed. Some of these antagonisms were relatively trivial — for example the deliberate neglect by the Russians of the buoying, dredging, etc., of the Sulina channel of the Danube estuary, so that ports such as Galatz should not compete effectively with Odessa as exporters of grain, and the protests from the Austrian government, eager to develop the Danube as a great artery of trade, which this evoked. Others were more serious — for example the tendency of French representatives in the Levant to support the Maronites and British ones the Druses in the violent conflicts between the two groups which disrupted the peace of the Lebanon in 1841-5. Nor was the popular distrust of Russia in Great Britain, so marked in the 1830s, in any way reduced. In 1842 British opposition led to the abandonment of a scheme to make Count P. D. Kiselev, the Russian official who had been Governor of the Principalities in 1829-34, Hospodar of Wallachia.? Nevertheless for several years after 1841 international antagonisms in the Near East became noticeably less acute. The most important sign of this slackening of tension was the secret and rather meaningless AngloRussian agreement of 1844.

ANGLO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS 1833-44 Throughout his reign Nicholas I believed that the collapse of the
Ottoman Empire could not be long delayed. Though in 1839-41 he
had helped to prolong its existence this did not mean that he now regarded it as viable. Clearly its collapse would bring great changes in the European state-system. It might also open the way to very serious international conflict over the fate of its territories. The Tsar therefore wished to postpone its fall until he had made satisfactory arrangements for its partition with the other powers mainly concerned. This, however, was far from easy to achieve. The profound contempt and distrust which Nicholas felt for the France of LouisPhilippe ensured that he made no attempt to reach an agreement with her on Near Eastern affairs. Nor was one needed; for if terms for a partition could be agreed with Austria and Great Britain the despised regime in Paris would be forced to accept them. As early as February 1833, therefore, Nicholas had made unsuccessful advances to Metternich for some agreement for future action by the two states in the Near East. In September 1843 he had two interviews in Warsaw with Ficquelmont, a leading Austrian diplomat, during which he sketched a possible partition of the Ottoman Empire (Austria might have everything between the Danube and the Aegean; Britain could take Egypt and divide the Greek islands with France). Yet another advance of this kind was made in Vienna in March of the following year through Count Orlov, the negotiator of the treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi. Metternich, however, distrustful of Russian ambitions and fundamentally uninterested in the Near East, was never willing to commit himself to any arrangement of the kind Nicholas desired. At least the basis of an agreement with Britain, on the other hand, seemed to have been reached with almost suspicious ease in the summer of 1844. After some hesitation Nicholas accepted an invitation from the British government to visit England and landed at Woolwich on 31 May. He left on g June; but this relatively short stay had shown that a certain community of outlook existed with the Conservative government which had come into power in Britain in September 1841. In particular Britain and Russia were united by a mutual dislike of France; fears of the growth of French naval power were then very active in London and there was acute friction over the claim of the French government to Tahiti and over French policy in Morocco. On 4 and 5 June the Tsar, supported by Brunnow and Orlov, had conversations at Windsor with Sir Robert Peel, the Prime Minister, and Lord Aberdeen, the Foreign Secretary. These resulted in an agreement to co-operate if the Ottoman Empire
seemed on the point of collapse or if it were attacked by some other

power. Meanwhile Britain and Russia would try to maintain the
empire and would come to an understanding about the action they
should take if it became clear that it could no longer be kept alive.
The agreement was purely verbal and remarkably vague. In par
ticular nothing was said about how imminent the threat to Turkey’s
existence must be before consultations between the two powers
should take place. Nor was anything agreed about the eventual disposal of Turkish territory, except that Nicholas made it clear that he would oppose control of Constantinople and the Straits by any one of the great powers (including Russia) or by an enlarged and strengthened Greece. When Nesselrode in his turn visited England in September 1844 he drew up a memorandum summarising the verbal agreement made early in June.! This was presented to Aberdeen on 19 September and accepted by him and Peel as being accurate. But already the situation was changing. The bombardment of Tangier by a French fleet on 6 August had brought Britain and France very close to war. By the time of Nesselrode’s visit six weeks later their disputes over Morocco and Tahiti were settled or were well on the way to being so. Russian support against France no longer seemed so necessary in London; and the agreement reached with the Tsar in June was already becoming from the British point of view a series of polite generalities rather than a basis for action. In the letter of 21 January 1845 in which he accepted Nesselrode’s memorandum as accurate Aberdeen merely expressed the hope that the ideas it contained ‘may be kept in view during all our negotiations connected with the Levant’. Also the agreement of 1844 bound only Peel and Aberdeen and not their successors. When the Peel cabinet fell at the end of June 1846 Aberdeen explained the Nesselrode Memorandum to Palmerston, his successor at the Foreign Office, who in turn informed Lord John Russell, the new Prime Minister, of its existence. But no other member of the cabinet was told of it; and it seems clear that Russell and Palmerston, and a fortiori their successors in the premiership and at the Foreign Office, did not consider themselves bound by it. Nicholas did not realise how little he had achieved. He placed

ANGLO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS 1844-9
throughout his reign a dangerous reliance upon personal relationships between monarchs and statesmen as a guarantee of stability in international relations, and read into his talks with Peel and Aberdeen a lasting British commitment which never existed. His advisers equally deceived themselves. Nesselrode believed that Aberdeen had ‘given without reserve his assent to the system of conduct traced for the present and the eventual obligations initiated for the future’. Brunnow for his part wrote triumphantly on 3 December 1844 that ‘the English cabinet has entered on a new road. It has taken it as a rule to have an understanding with Russia before agreeing with all the other courts of Europe’.? The revolutions of 1848 were soon to show how far Britain and Russia still were from any genuine co-operation in the Near East. Palmerston wished to allow Russian troops to help in the restoration of Habsburg power in Hungary. Since one obvious route from Russia to Hungary lay through the Danubian principalities he did not object to the suppression by the Russian army in the summer of 1848 of the feeble revolution which had broken out in Wallachia a month or two earlier. But the collapse of Hungarian resistance in August 1849 was followed by the flight into Turkish territory of a large number of Hungarian and Polish revolutionaries whose presence there soon led to a genuine international crisis. The Russian government demanded the extradition of the Poles, the Austrian government that of the Hungarians; and on 17 September, they broke off diplomatic relations with the Porte in protest against its honourable and courageous refusal to grant their demands. The dispute, in which the Turks were actively supported by Palmerston, died away as quickly as it had arisen. Nicholas I, perhaps influenced by the strongly proTurkish attitude of British public opinion, showed himself surprisingly conciliatory to Fuad Pasha, the Turkish emissary who had been sent to St. Petersburg by the Porte in an effort to settle the affair. He abandoned the demand for extradition of the Polish refugees; and the Austrians, deprived of Russian support, had little alternative but to do the same as regards the Hungarian ones. By the first week in November the crisis was at an end. A month earlier, however, when tension was at its height, the British and French Mediterranean squadrons had been sent to the neighbourhood of the Dardanelles to be at hand if the Sultan should ask for them to be sent up to Constantinople. On 1 November the British commander, Admiral Parker, encouraged by Stratford Canning (once more British ambassador to Constantinople) and by Calvert, the British consul at the Dardanelles, entered the Straits on 1 Zaionchkovskii, op. cit. i. 138-9.

the pretext that the convention of 1841 allowed warships to proceed as far as the Narrows, about twenty miles from the entrance. The incident was trivial. The squadron left the Dardanelles on the 13th and Palmerston at once admitted that its action had violated the Straits Convention. But it had shown how dangerously international relations in the Near East might be influenced by a belligerent admiral or ambassador; and the strong Russian response to Parker’s action — Brunnow threatened that the Russian Black Sea fleet might enter the Bosphorus in retaliation — showed how sensitive Russia now was to any semblance of a threat to her interests at the Straits.
The question of the Holy Places, which provided the ostensible origins, though in no real sense the cause, of the Crimean War, had a long history.! For centuries the wrangling of Catholic and Orthodox monks and dignitaries over the rights of their respective churches in Jerusalem, Nazareth and Bethlehem had amused and irritated their Turkish masters. In 1690 afirman issued by the Sultan had granted the Latins a dominant position in the Holy Places. It was very slowly and inadequately executed, but in 1740 they appeared to have won a decisive and permanent victory over their Greek antagonists. By the new Capitulations signed by the French and Turkish governments in that year they were granted a number of important privileges. By the later eighteenth century, however, the theoretically superior position of the Latins was becoming impossible to maintain in practice. By the 1830s, if not before, it had completely vanished. The increasing strength of the Greeks was based ultimately on the greater piety of their followers, and in particular on the enormous preponderance of Greek over Latin pilgrims to the Holy Places which enriched the Greek monasteries and clerics.” Moreover by the 1840s there were ominous signs that both the French and Russian governments were increasingly inclined to support their protégés. In April 1841 Nicholas I approved the renovation of two Orthodox monasteries for use as hostels by Russian pilgrims to Jerusalem. In 1843 Uspenskii, the former chaplain of the Russian embassy in Vienna, was sent by Nesselrode to study the religious position in the Holy Land, while in the same year the Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem escaped from the strict control
1 The best treatment of the legal aspects of the question is F. von Verdy du Vernois, Die Frage der Heiligen Statten (Berlin, 1901). 2 A French monk who visited the Holy Land in 1831 was told that of 10,000 pilgrims visiting Jerusalem at Easter as few as twenty might be Latins (Temperley, op. cit., p. 462).

by that of Constantinople to which it had for many years been subjected. In February 1848 an officially-supported Russian ecclesiastical mission led by Uspenskii arrived in Jerusalem. The French also were far from idle. The government of Louis XVIII had raised the question of Catholic rights in the Holy Places as long ago as 1819; but it was not pressed and soon disappeared in the complications aroused by the Greek revolt. In 1842, however, the French government demanded to be allowed to help in the repair of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre; and in the following year the establishment of a French consul in Jerusalem indicated that a more effective interest in the question of the Holy Places was developing in Paris. In 1847 a Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem was established with the very energetic Joseph Valerga as the first Patriarch. The potential conflict between France and Russia which was thus emerging had very dangerous possibilities because on both sides genuine popular feeling was engaged. Russia, in spite of the increasing degradation and ineffectiveness of her Church, was still Holy Russia. A religious issue could arouse passions there which no question of secular politics could. In the same way in France Catholic feeling and a demand for the protection of Catholic rights could move thousands to whom strategy and the balance of power meant nothing. An unpopular and inefficient despotism like that of Nicholas I, a government hungry for popular support as that of France was after 1848, were all too likely to play for popularity by stiffening their attitudes and extending their demands in Palestine. In the middle of 1850 Louis Napoleon, now for two years President of the Second Republic, succumbed to the temptation. Angling for Catholic support, he demanded the reassertion and enforcement of the concessions made to the Latins in 1740. His claims, which were supported by Austria, the other great Catholic power of Europe, could be justified in law. The agreement of 1740 was a valid international instrument and could not be legally nullified except with the consent of both signatories. But they were claims dangerous to international peace. Though they were essentially an outgrowth of France’s domestic politics and not intended as an anti-Russian move, they were certain to provoke bitter resistance and perhaps counter-demands from Russia. In fact Nicholas I, who was intensely hostile to the Second Republic in France and to the presence of a Bonaparte at its head, did his utmost to maintain the status quo in the Holy Land. The result was that for the next three years the Porte, which cared nothing for the relatively trivial issues involved, found itself subjected to increasing bullying and nagging from both Paris and St. Petersburg. Its obvious weakness and futile efforts to please
116


ANGLO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS 1851-2
both its tormentors were themselves sources of danger, since they encouraged both French and Russians to increase their pressure on it and take up more and more warlike postures in the Near East. In the autumn of 1851 a suggestion that all the churches and shrines concerned should be placed in joint Catholic and Orthodox possession, which had been accepted by Lavalette, the French ambassador to the Porte, broke down on the refusal of Nicholas I to agree to it. On 9 February 1852 the Porte, under heavy French pressure, made considerable concessions to the Latins; but as these conflicted directly with the promises it had made to the Greeks in a jirman issued only a day or two earlier the total effect was merely to make clear how weak, shifty and vulnerable to outside pressure it was. Its weakness was further emphasised when in May the Sultan was forced to allow a French man-of-war, the Charlemagne, to pass through the Dardanelles en route to Constantinople. Since it had on board Lavalette, who was returning from leave, this was not technically a breach of the Straits Convention. But it was a provocative gesture which was indulged in primarily to strengthen the position in France of the Prince-President, as Louis Napoleon now was. Once more French domestic politics had helped to envenom Franco—Russian relations; and on 22 November Ozerov, the Russian chargé d’affaires at Constantinople, was ordered to promise the Turks Russian support in case of a French attack. By the end of the year Basili, the Russian consul in Jerusalem, had found his position untenable and abandoned his post, while the Porte, under the urgings of Fuad Pasha, the Foreign Minister, had agreed to concede the Latins one of their chief demands — possession of a key to the Church of the Nativity at Bethlehem. Nevertheless Russia’s Near Eastern position at the end of 1852 seemed strong. Anglo-French relations were still fluid. In May the British government had refused suggestions originating from Count Buol, the Austrian Foreign Minister, and accepted by both Russia and Prussia, that Louis Napoleon be asked to give some guarantee of his peaceful intentions before the powers recognised the imperial regime which he clearly meant to establish in France. It was more obvious than ever that British statesmen did not share the fear of revolution and the passionate legitimism which meant so much to Nicholas I. On the other hand Palmerston, the most anti-Russian of the major figures in British political life, had been driven from the Foreign Office at the end of 1851 by the hostility of Queen Victoria,

He thus asserted, at least in his own eyes, the unity of the European monarchies against the Bonapartist threat emanating from Paris. Moreover there had been no sign of British support for French claims in the Near East. On 20 December Lord Malmesbury, Foreign Secretary in the tottering Conservative ministry led by Lord Derby, ordered Lord Cowley, the British ambassador in Paris, to urge caution on the French government in its handling of the Holy Places question since ‘it is one of those points upon which the moral power of the Emperor of Russia rests’.t Above all the last days of 1852 saw the formation of a coalition government led by Aberdeen. The accession to power of an elderly and pacific statesman who had apparently shown sympathy with Russia’s Near Eastern plans eight years earlier was taken in St. Petersburg as a good omen; and on 14 January 1853 Nesselrode wrote to Russell, the new Foreign Secretary, urging that Britain use her influence to ‘bring the French cabinet back to counsels of prudence’. In Vienna also the death in April 1852 of Prince Schwarzenburg, the masterful Prime Minister who since November 1848 had maintained good relations with France and a high degree of independence of Russia, seemed to have brought Austrian policy more into line with that of St. Petersburg. Nesselrode, in his memorandum to the Tsar on the events of 1852, was able to report that the attitude of Austria had been satisfactory? and Nicholas, in February 1853, even claimed that ‘when I speak of Russia I speak of Austria as well; what suits one suits the other; our interests as regards Turkey are perfectly identical’.® The Tsar had seriously misjudged the attitude of the British government and quite failed to grasp the importance of the increasingly anti-Russian public opinion in Britain. And he now provided apparent justification for British distrust by indulging in another venture in personal diplomacy— the Seymour conversations of January 1853. The first of his conversations with Sir George Hamilton Seymour, the British ambassador to Russia, took place on g January, the second and more important one five days later. (Nesselrode had already tried vainly, in a memorandum of 1 January, to dissuade Nicholas from any attempt at a new agreement with Britain.) In what he said to Seymour the Tsar was mainly concerned to urge the conclusion of another Anglo—Russian agreement, informal and purely verbal, on the action to be taken when the Ottoman Empire collapsed. He emphasised that none of the great powers must have

ANGLO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS 1853 Constantinople and that the Principalities must be under Russian protection. Britain, he suggested, might receive compensation in Egypt and Crete. This was neither meant nor received as a cut-anddried scheme of partition.t What the Tsar wanted was to ensure Britain’s general support for Russia in the Near East and the making of some Anglo—Russian agreement on how the Ottoman Empire should eventually be disposed of; and he seemed at first to have gone an appreciable distance towards this. Russell, when he replied in a despatch of g February to Seymour’s report of the conversations, said that the collapse of the Ottoman Empire was still a very remote contingency and that an agreement limited to Britain and Russia was more likely to cause a general war in the Near East than to prevent one. But he promised to communicate with the Tsar before making any agreement with another power on the action to be taken if Turkey collapsed, and also recognised the ‘exceptional protection’ which Russia exercised over the Orthodox Christians of the Ottoman Empire. The correspondence which continued for the next two months, however, saw both Seymour and Russell become increasingly suspicious of the Tsar. By the end of March, the ambassador thought war with Russia a possibility, though as yet a very remote one. Russell for his part had come to believe that ‘the Emperor of Russia is clearly bent on accomplishing the destruction of Turkey, and he must be resisted’. This was still very much a minority view in London. But the Tsar completely failed to understand how impossible it was for a parliamentary government to give him the gentleman’s agreement for which he asked — and, it must be added, Aberdeen and Russell made no effort to explain this aspect of the situation to him. ‘A study of these negotiations’, wrote the ablest recent student of the subject, ‘does not reveal the Tsar as a plotter; it reveals him as a blunderer, whose blunders were equalled by those of the British ministers.” Nicholas’s belief that the fall of the Ottoman Empire could not be long delayed was based partly on the acute Austro—Turkish tension which had arisen by the beginning of 1853 over the position in Montenegro. The vigorous rule of Omer Pasha, the Turkish governor of Bosnia, had already in 1852 drawn protests from Vienna where it was alleged that he was interfering with trade across the Austrian border and forcing potentially dangerous refugees to find asylum

from his regime in Habsburg territory. In the last weeks of 1852, after a group of Montenegrins had seized a town in Turkish territory, he declared war on his own initiative on the primitive little state. The Austrian government was determined not to permit a Turkish conquest of Montenegro and the strengthening of Turkey’s position on the Adriatic and the southern frontiers of the Habsburg Empire which would follow. Early in February 1853, therefore, an Austrian diplomat, Count Leiningen, was sent to Constantinople on a special mission. The ultimatum of which he was the bearer demanded an end to the war with Montenegro and a change of governor in Bosnia. Largely because he was strongly backed by Russia! Leiningen was rapidly successful. On 12 February the Porte agreed to the removal of Omer Pasha from Bosnia and the signature of an armistice with Montenegro. A peace treaty was signed three weeks later. The whole incident was in itself trivial. Yet in the context of early 1853 in the Near East it was far from insignificant. It appeared to underline once more the weakness and incipient collapse of the Ottoman Empire. It strengthened in St. Petersburg the dangerous belief that the Turks would always give way if they were threatened and bullied enough. It intensified in Constantinople, though this was not immediately apparent, the resentment of foreign and infidel pressure which was now gathering strength there. The idea of sending a special Russian envoy to Constantinople to secure satisfaction for Russia’s demands on behalf of the Orthodox Christians originated from Nesselrode, not from the Tsar. Nicholas however took up the idea energetically; and on 11 February Prince A. 8. Menshikov left St. Petersburg for Constantinople as the special representative of the Tsar. His instructions, drafted by Nesselrode, ordered him in the first place to secure the exclusion of Fuad Pasha, the Turkish Foreign Minister, from the negotiatio—nsin itself a striking assertion of Russian power if it were achieved. He was also to secure the signature of a Russo—Turkish convention re-establishing Orthodox privileges in the Holy Places and the issue of a firman making it clear that the giving of a key to the Church of the Nativity to the Catholics in December 1852 in no way altered the position there. If necessary he could propose to the Porte a Russo—Turkish defensive alliance to last for a fixed number of years. This would bind Russia to protect Turkey against French hostility arising out of the Holy Places dispute. Most important of all, Menshikov was to threaten a breach of diplomatic relations if his demands were not

met. If necessary he was to present to the Grand Vizier a note containing this threat; if this produced no result he was to leave the Turkish capital within three days. Menshikov was a bad choice for so delicate and important a mission, He was a professional soldier without diplomatic abilities or experience. He was a strong Orthodox churchman (this was probably one reason why Nicholas chose him) and the strength of his religious beliefs helped to make him rigid and uncompromising in his dealings with the Turks. His position as the personal emissary of the Tsar also made it difficult for him to carry on genuine negotiations with the Porte, since these involved at least the possibility of mutual concessions. The military threat which underlay his mission was illustrated by the fact that he was accompanied to Constantinople by the Chief of Staff of the Russian 5th Army, then stationed in Bessarabia, and by a high-ranking officer of the Black Sea fleet. The determination of the Russians to assert their influence at the Porte was made clear from the moment of Menshikov’s arrival in the Turkish capital on 28 February. His letters of credence, contrary to the established custom, were in Russian only. He appeared for his first audience at the Porte in civilian dress, not in uniform; this was a grave and deliberate breach of etiquette. He very quickly brought about the resignation of Fuad Pasha and his replacement on 6 March by Rifaat Pasha. Yet on the wider demands which formed the substance of his mission he failed to achieve satisfaction. In part this was the result of his own limitations as a diplomat. In part it was the result of the rather incoherent delaying tactics of the Porte. In part it was because the Turks were now enjoying increasingly active British and French backing. This took some time to develop. In March the British cabinet refused to allow Colonel Rose, its chargé d’affaires in Constantinople, to summon the British Mediterranean squadron from Malta to the Gulf of Smyrna, as he wished to do in response to a Turkish request for British and French support. Simultaneously the French Council of Ministers, after much debate, agreed to send the French fleet only as far as Salamis in Greece — a weak compromise between sending it to Turkish waters and keeping it at Toulon. More important, however, was the fact that Lord Stratford de Redcliffe (as Stratford Canning had become in 1852) returned to Constantinople from leave on 5 April. He did so much against the will of both Aberdeen and Lord Clarendon, the Foreign Secretary, who distrusted his headstrong character and anti-Russian bias. Their fears proved justified, for by the end of the month he was

helping to stiffen Turkish resistance to the claims of Menshikov. On 10 April the Russian envoy had decided not to press his wider claims for the time being and to concentrate rather on the question of the Holy Places. On 5 May, however, in perhaps the most important step towards war taken by any of the states concerned, he demanded that the Porte conclude with Russia within five days an agreement guaranteeing the position of the Orthodox Christians within the Ottoman Empire. The implications of this demand were enormous. The French had never claimed more than the right to protect Catholic monks and priests; Russia through Menshikov was now demanding the right to protect Orthodox laymen under Turkish rule — in other words about two-fifths of the total population of the Ottoman Empire. This claim, if conceded, would enable Russia to intervene almost at will in the internal affairs of the empire. Menshikov’s demand offered a far more real threat to Turkish independence than the treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi had ever done. The Turkish government, however weak and divided, was therefore totally unwilling to accept it. On 10 May the Porte promised to respect the rights of its Orthodox subjects and the immunities of the Greek church; but it refused to sign the agreement for which Menshikov was asking and thus endanger Turkish independence. On both sides the forces making for war were now gaining the upper hand. Menshikov abandoned his demand for a treaty and agreed to accept merely ‘a free but solemn engagement’ on the part of the Turkish ministers. This was an important concession; but it was coupled with a demand for a reply within three days and a threat to regard his mission as at an end if the Porte did not accept his revised proposal. On 13 May he secured the dismissal of the Foreign Minister, Rifaat Pasha, and his replacement by Reschid Pasha who would, he quite wrongly thought, be more receptive to Russian demands. The deep resentment which his arrogance had now produced in Constantinople was to be a dominant factor in the events of the following months. Moreover it is clear, though little is known in detail about this aspect of the negotiations, that some at least of Menshikov’s subordinates hoped for war and tried to impede the success of his mission. They won an important success by engineering, early in May, the suspension of the First Dragoman of the Russian embassy through whom he had hitherto negotiated with the Porte and who was in favour of a peaceful settlement. The complex and futile diplomacy which marked the last stages of Menshikov’s mission is unworthy of detailed discussion. On 17 May the newly-created Turkish Grand Council (an assembly of
ministers, former ministers, provincial governors and ulema) met and
122


ANGLO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS 1853
decided to reject the Russian demand for an agreement over the position of the Orthodox Christians. On the following day, and again on the 20th, Reschid offered to make concessions over the Holy Places and the position of the Orthodox clergy there; but both in form and substance these offers fell far short of the Russian demands. On the 21st, in a note to the Turkish Foreign Minister, Menshikov said that any Turkish declaration which safeguarded merely the religious rights of the Orthodox and not the others which they might claim to enjoy would be regarded by Russia as a hostile act. This was the final blunder on the part of the Russian envoy, for it strengthened in Constantinople the belief that Russian concern for Orthodox religious claims was merely a camouflage for political interference in the Ottoman Empire. On the same day Menshikov left the Turkish capital; and with the departure of the Russian chargé d’affaires on the 27th diplomatic relations between the two states were broken. Precisely how far the Turkish ministers were influenced in their resistance to Menshikov’s demands by the attitude of La Cour, the French ambassador, and above all of Stratford de Redcliffe, is a still-debated and probably insoluble question. Menshikov himself attributed his failure very largely to the influence of Stratford. His despatches contain many complaints of the influence which the British ambassador wielded and in the last days of his mission he was told by Reschid that only pressure from Stratford prevented Turkish acceptance of the Russian demands. However the evidence of Reschid is far from reliable; and there is no evidence that the British ambassador ever promised the Porte active British help against Russia during the critical days which followed the Russian note of 5 May. His reputation as a Russophobe was now well known; and his mere presence at Constantinople, irrespective of anything he said or did, strengthened the anti-Russian forces at the Porte. But the driving force behind resistance to Menshikov’s demands was truly Turkish and owed very little to outside encouragement. The threatened security and even existence of the Ottoman Empire; the injured pride of the Turkish ministers in face of Menshikov’s bullying; rising popular religious fanaticism in face of infidel pressure — it is not necessary to look further than these to explain the direction which events took. And Menshikov himself, in a despatch in which he described the Turkish ministers as “bewitched by the effect produced here by the frantic activity of the British representative’! admitted that the attitude of La Cour had been calm and reserved. 1 Zaionchkovskii, op. cit. 1. 429.
123


1853 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 With the failure of the Menshikov mission military action by Russia to support her claims had become imminent. And with every fresh forward move by Russia the likelihood of counter moves by Britain and France increased. The vicious circle of challenge and response which was to culminate in war was all too easily established. Already before the end of May, Nicholas I had outlined a scheme by which the Porte should be made to bow to increasing Russian pressure. If the treaty demanded by Menshikov were not immediately granted Russia must occupy the Principalities. If this yielded no results the Bosphorus should be blockaded by the Russian Black Sea fleet and the independence of the Principalities recognised by Russia. If necessary this could be followed by the recognition of the independence of Serbia also. Austria should be asked to mass troops on the frontiers of Herzegovina and Serbia, and if necessary occupy the latter, to increase still further the moral and military pressure on the Porte.! Such a far-reaching scheme of action was still neither necessary nor practicable; but on 31 May Nesselrode told Reschid that if within eight days the Porte had not accepted Menshikov’s demands the Russian army would cross the frontier into the Principalities, not to make war but to obtain ‘material guarantees’ to be held until the Porte gave Russia satisfaction. Certainly neither the T’sar nor his Foreign Minister wanted war. A day or two later, in an interview with Castelbajac, the French ambassador in St. Petersburg, Nicholas stressed that it could help only the revolutionary forces in Europe and appealed to the French government to use its influence at Constantinople to get his demands accepted there. But a Russian occupation of the Principalities, still formally Turkish territory, was clearly imminent; and on 30 May the British government empowered Stratford to summon the Mediterranean squadron to Constantinople if this seemed necessary. On 2 June, after several days of indecision, it decided to move the squadron from Malta to Besika Bay, just outside the Dardanelles, as a gesture of support for the Turks. The British warships reached their new station on the 13th and were joined there next day by the French squadron from Salamis. Britain and France were thus more clearly committed than at any time since the beginning of the crisis to the defence of the Ottoman Empire; and this fact clearly encouraged Reschid’s final rejection of the Russian proposals on 16June. On the 28th Nicholas announced the imminent entry of his forces into the Principalities. Russian units began to cross the Pruth on 3 July and on the 6th Prince

ANGLO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS 1853 entered Bucharest. The effect of this disastrous month of June 1853 was that Russia on the one hand and Britain and France on the other had taken up positions which it was extremely difficult to maintain indefinitely but from which it was impossible to withdraw without obvious loss of prestige. None of them had the slightest desire for war; but all were now using their armies or navies for essentially diplomatic purposes without any real understanding of the dangers this involved. Russian policy had been blind in another and equally important way. Nicholas I had assumed throughout the events of 1852 that he possessed in Austria a completely reliable ally. Habsburg gratitude for the part played by Russia in suppressing the Hungarian nationalists in 1849, and a mutual fear of revolution, seemed in St. Petersburg to unite the two empires at least for some time to come. This assumption was completely mistaken and the seriousness of the mistake was now beginning to be apparent. At the end of January 1853 Count Buol, the Austrian Foreign Minister, had stressed the common interests of Russia and Austra in the Near East and the need for them to support each other against all other powers there. Six months later, however, the Russian ambassador in Vienna was forced to admit that the Austrian support so confidently expected in St. Petersburg had not been forthcoming.’ The policy of Buol was remarkable in the summer of 1853 mainly for its indecision. The Russian occupation of the Principalities, by threatening Austrian trade down the Danube to the Black Sea, struck at the real interests of the Habsburg far more than of the Ottoman Empire. Yet Buol did nothing to oppose the occupation (though he did ask for it to be delayed). On the other hand he also did nothing to force the Porte to accept Menshikov’s proposals, as it had been hoped in St. Petersburg that he would. This policy of drift was not actively hostile to Russia but it fell far short of what the Tsar and his ministers had expected from Vienna. On 6 July Count Gyulay, an aide-de-camp of the Emperor Francis Joseph and a former Austrian War Minister, arrived in St. Petersburg. He had been sent on a special mission to urge the Tsar to limit the effects and above all the duration of the Russian occupation of the Principalities. This new demonstration of Austrian lukewarmness naturally made a bad impression in the Russian capital; but Nesselrode and his chief subordinate, Senyavin, were able to persuade Nicholas to continue to rely on Austrian good offices at Constantinople for the achievement of his aims there. It was with matters in this position that Buol convoked on 24 July a meeting of the representatives in Vienna of Britain, France and 1 Meyendorff, op. cit. ill. 53.

1853 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
Prussia (the Russian ambassador refused to attend as he had no instructions) in an effort to achieve a settlement of the RussoTurkish dispute. The outcome of this was the Vienna Note which proposed that the Sultan should promise to observe the spirit and letter of the treaties of 1774 and 1829 as regarded the rights of the Orthodox Church, to extend to the Orthodox all privileges enjoyed by members of other Christian sects, and to make no change in the existing position of his Christian subjects without the agreement of the French and Russian governments. On 1 August the text of the note was despatched to St. Petersburg for approval. Four days later it was accepted by the Russian government and hopes of a peaceful settlement of the crisis rose sharply. It soon became clear that they were unfounded. The Turkish government was reluctant to accept a settlement in the drawing-up of which it had had no share. It also resented the fact that the proposals of the powers had been submitted to the Russian government before being sent to Constantinople. Almost at the moment when the Note was being despatched to St. Petersburg there arrived in Vienna the text of a letter from Reschid to Nesselrode. This letter, the misleadingly-named ‘Turkish Ultimatum’, made much smaller concessions to Russia than the Vienna note had done. Clearly the Porte was unwilling to go as far as the powers wished in conciliating Nicholas I; and its recalcitrance was increased when on 12 August there arrived at Constantinople an Egyptian squadron sent by the Viceroy, Said Pasha, the son of Mohammed Ali, to support his overlord in the face of Russian threats. On 20 August the Turkish Grand Council rejected the Vienna Note as it stood; it agreed to accept it only ifit were changed to make it clear that the privileges of the Orthodox in the Ottoman Empire derived entirely from voluntary concessions by the Sultans and not from past agreements with Russia. On 7 September the Russian government refused to accept such a drastic modification. Its refusal was accompanied by a memorandum which interpreted the Vienna Note as giving Russia a right of intervention in the Ottoman Empire on behalf of the Orthodox. The changes demanded by the Porte, it was argued, destroyed this right and were therefore unacceptable in St. Petersburg. This interpretation of the Vienna Note, which leaked out through a Berlin newspaper, alarmed and embarrassed the British and French governments, both of which had assured the Turks that it provided no legal basis for Russian intervention. By 17 September, therefore, they had abandoned the Note which was now clearly an irrevocable failure. The French ambassador at Constantinople as well as the Austrian minister had urged the Turks throughout August to accept the
126


ANGLO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS 1853
Vienna Note. The Prussian minister was less whole-hearted in his support for it; but his attitude counted for little. Whether Stratford de Redcliffe, as has often been alleged, privately urged the Turkish ministers to reject the Note while publicly advising them to accept it, is uncertain. Certainly many well-informed people in Britain and several members of the cabinet believed that he had behaved in this way.’ But for the support from British public opinion which he was known to enjoy he would probably have been recalled. The traditional accounts of the origins of the Crimean War, however, have nearly always taken Stratford too much at his own valuation and asa result exaggerated his role in producing the conflict. The Turkish rejection of the Vienna Note arose naturally from the attitude of both ministers and public opinion in Constantinople. It was in no sense imposed upon the Porte from outside, by Stratford or anyone else; and it is debatable whether even the strongest support of the Note by the British ambassador could have forced it upon an unwilling Turkish government. Events now marched rapidly to their logical outcome. On 11-12 September there were riots and demonstrations in Constantinople in favour of war with Russia; and two British and two French warships sailed through the Dardanelles to protect foreigners in the Turkish capital. On the 23rd Aberdeen and Clarendon, without consulting the rest of the cabinet, agreed to a French proposal that the British and French squadrons, still at Besika Bay, should be sent to Constantinople. Two days later the Turkish Grand Council decided on war with Russia rather than continued fruitless discussions. On 4 October Stratford was ordered to summon the British squadron to Constantinople, though he did not act on this order until the 21st. Even in the last days of September there seemed a faint hope of averting war. On the 24th Nicholas I arrived at Olmiitz in Bohemia for an interview with Francis Joseph (mainly in an effort to weaken the good Austro—French and Austro—British relations which now seemed to be developing). Nesselrode, who accompanied him, agreed with Buol that the Vienna Note should be submitted once more, unchanged, to the Porte. It would now be accompanied, however, by a written denial of any Russian intention to interfere in the internal affairs of the Ottoman Empire. But it was too late for this

1853 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
expedient, the so-called “Buol Project’, to have any hope of success. The British government refused to accept it, so great was now its distrust of Nicholas I; and its attitude forced Napoleon ITI, against his will, to reject it also. Even if the western powers had accepted the Austro—Russian proposals it is hard to believe that the Turkish ministers would or could have done anything but reject them out of hand. On 29 September the Sultan ratified the decision of the Grand Council for war with Russia. On 10 October Prince Gorchakov was presented with a Turkish ultimatum demanding the evacuation of the Principalities. Unless it were complied with within a fortnight war would begin. Stratford de Redcliffe still hoped that the Turks might accept the Vienna Note modified as they demanded and supplemented by a declaration of the powers guaranteeing that Russia would demand no new concessions and that the Porte would fulfil all the obligations it had assumed. For this reason he delayed as long as he could the passage of the British squadron through the Dardanelles to Constantinople. He also persuaded Reschid to order the Turkish field commanders not to open hostilities before 1 November. But his hopes were as delusive as those of Buol and Nesselrode during their Olmiitz meeting. On 23 October Turkish batteries fired on a Russian flotilla on the Danube and on the 27th Omer Pasha crossed the river with a Turkish army. Simultaneously fighting broke out in the Caucasus. A new Russo—Turkish war had begun and by 15 November, after some difficulty with contrary winds, the British and French squadrons were at anchor in the Bosphorus. It seemed reasonable to hope, however, that the war might soon be ended by the mediation of the powers. On 29 November Nesselrode told Castelbajac that Russia was willing to accept the joint good offices of Britain, France, Austria and Prussia. On 13 December the Porte agreed to open negotiations under four-power mediation. But the danger of war between Russia and the western powers was clearly increasing. This was above all because of the more and more violently anti-Russian attitude of British public opinion, or at least of its reflection in the British press. Napoleon III was not anxious for war. He had attained his objectives in the diplomatic conflict over the Holy Places (an issue which had never been of more than second-rate importance to him in any case) and he realised how difficult and profitless a conflict with Russia was likely to prove. He had wished to accept the ‘Buol Project’; and of his ministers only Fould, the Minister of State, seemed to favour a great international conflict. But he was extremely anxious to maintain good relations with Britain (a dominant factor in the situation whose
128


ANGLO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS 1853
significance Nicholas I and his ministers quite failed to grasp) and
in Britain a quarter ofa century of Russophobe propaganda was now
producing its inevitable results. “The violence and scurrility of the
press’, wrote an English political diarist on 26 September, ‘exceeds all belief. Day after day the Radical and Tory papers, animated by very different motives, pour forth the most virulent abuse of the Emperor of Russia, of Austria, and of this Government, especially of Aberdeen.’”? The effect of this anti-Russian press campaign was greatly increased by the weakness and division of the cabinet. An unwieldy combination of Whigs and Peelites, it was more lacking in coherence than any other British government of the mid-nineteenth century; and in October-November 1853 its disunity became increasingly marked. Its leader, Aberdeen, was pacific and sensible but also elderly, weak and capable of being stampeded into hasty and inadequately considered action. “Such an aged person,’ commented the Polish émigré leader Prince Adam Czartoryski after an interview with him early in July 1853, ‘slumbering, always gloomy, whose blood is cold and sluggishly circulating, cannot inspire confidence for the administration of which he is the head.’? Clarendon, the Foreign Secretary, was less pacific than Aberdeen. He was also one of the most cynical of British statesmen about the importance of Near Eastern affairs and spoke of ‘all these disputes about nothing and this miserable rivalry for useless influence’ there. But he shared many of Aberdeen’s ideas and his distrust and dislike of Stratford de Redcliffe. He also realised that Russia now wanted nothing but an honourable escape from an embarrassing position and he was intensely irritated by the Turkish declaration of war. Facing Aberdeen and Clarendon, however, were Lord John Russell and above all Palmerston, now relegated to the Home Secretaryship but still by far the most popular member of the cabinet. These ministers stood for active support of Turkey and resistance to Russia’s Near Eastern ambitions; early in October they had urged unsuccessfully that the British Mediterranean squadron should be sent not merely to Constantinople but through the Bosphorus into the Black Sea. Palmerston’s pride, strength of character and popularity made him in particular a standing threat to what remained of Aberdeen’s authority. The anti-Russian emotions which had been developing in Britain for so long burst forth with unprecedented violence when, on 30 November, a Turkish squadron was annihilated by the far superior

Russian Black Sea fleet in the harbour of Sinope on the north coast of Asia Minor. This violent reaction to the ‘massacre of Sinope’ was quite unjustified. The battle was a perfectly legitimate operation of war. It is true that in a circular of 31 October, the Tsar had promised to remain on the defensive in the war with Turkey; but this was before he knew that the Turks had taken the offensive in the Principalities and the Caucasus. Nevertheless the attack on the Turkish squadron was widely regarded in Britain as treacherous; and the bitterness of popular or at least press feeling against Russia was so great that the weak and divided cabinet, against the better judgement of many of its members, found itself moving steadily towards war. As early as 7 December, before news of the battle had reached London, Clarendon ordered Seymour to tell the Russian government unofficially that if Russian troops crossed the Danube men and stores being sent by sea from one Russian port to another would be intercepted by British ships. On the roth the French government strongly demanded in London that Russian warships and troop transports in the Black Sea be intercepted there and forced to return to port.? It seems unlikely that Napoleon III would have acted alone in sending his fleet into the Black Sea. But Drouyn de Lhuys, the French Foreign Minister, threatened that he would if he were not supported by Britain; and in the existing state of public opinion a refusal to act in concert with France against Russia would probably have been fatal to the government. On the 22nd it decided to send the British squadron then in the Straits into the Black Sea. On 4 January 1854 the British and French fleets entered that sea. It was now clear that a great international war was merely a matter of time. On 20 January the Russian government received a proposal from the British, French and Prussian ambassadors in Vienna, and from Buol, for the summoning of a peace conference in a neutral city and a Russian evacuation of the Principalities. This was indignantly refused. A Turkish plenipotentiary must come to St. Petersburg or to the Russian headquarters at Bucharest to make peace; and the evacuation of the Principalities must be a result and not a preliminary of the peace conference. On 1 February the Russian representatives in London and Paris, in answer to enquiries they had been ordered to make, were told that though the British and French fleets would prevent the Turks from attacking the Russians in the Black Sea (the Turks were in any case much too weak to attempt this with any hope of success) they would also

ANGLO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS 1854
prevent any movement of men or supplies from one Russian port to another. Clearly this was not very far removed from a declaration of war. On the 4th the Russian representatives asked for their passports; two days later they set out for home, though the British and French ministers at St. Petersburg did not leave until nearly a fortnight later. On 12 March, Britain and France signed with the Porte a treaty by which they committed themselves to the defence of Turkish territory against Russia. War was formally declared in London and Paris on 28 March. No state or statesman had wanted the war. All bore some responsibility for it. The weakness and misgovernment of the Ottoman Empire, the frequent duplicity of its ministers, provided the background to the struggle; and the Porte’s rejection of the Vienna Note was one of the decisive steps towards its outbreak. Napoleon III’s need to play to the gallery in France and his consequent and rather gratuitous raising of the Holy Places question began the sequence of events which culminated in war. His need to make striking gestures — for example the sending of the French fleet to Salamis in March 1853 and to Besika Bay in June — and not to suffer obvious defeats helped on various occasions to keep tension high. Nicholas I, though he had a good case, in common sense if not in law, over the Holy Places, clearly misjudged the situation. He assumed a community of outlook between the British and Russian governments which did not exist. He quite unjustifiably took for granted Austrian sympathy and support. He failed to understand how dangerously bellicose popular feeling in Constantinople was becoming by the summer of 1853. His choice of Menshikov as special emissary to the Porte was unfortunate. Above all the Russian occupation of the Principalities raised the whole crisis to a new level of seriousness by introducing for the first time an element of overt military coercion. As far as Britain is concerned the blame must be shouldered in part by a weak and divided cabinet and still more by the Russophobe public opinion which had been built up over the last generation and which was roused to fury by the perfectly legitimate destruction of the Turkish fleet at Sinope. The British people, or at least the articulate and politically conscious part of it, wanted war by the beginning of 1854; the Russian and French peoples did not. Under the influence of public opinion and anxious not to jeopardise the French alliance the government drifted into a conflict with Russia. It is this combination of weakness in Downing Street and emotion in Fleet Street, far more than the movements of the British Mediterranean squadron or anything Stratford de Redcliffe did or failed to doin Constantinople, which explains Britain’s involvement in the war.

1853-4 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
The Crimean War was thus the outcome of a series of misjudgements, misunderstandings and blunders, of stupidity, pride and obstinacy rather than of ill will. More than any great war of modern times, it took place by accident.
Memories of 1812 and consciousness of the size and resources of his country made the ordinary Russian confident of victory. But his rulers were only too well aware of the difficulties of the position. Already on 11 December 1853 Meyendorff, the able Russian ambassador in Vienna, had urged that peace be made with the Turks as soon as possible, since in a long war in which the Porte was supported by Britain and France Russia could not hope for decisive victory. Her position was weakened above all by the attitude of Austria, which was growing more and more unfriendly. ‘There was still much pro-Russian feeling among the military leaders of the Habsburg mona— Wrindcischhgryatz, Radetsky, Schlick, Jellachich, Clam-Gall—aasnd among the highest ranks of Viennese society. Moreover Buol was never on personally close terms with Francis Joseph. But increasingly Austrian policy was dominated not merely by dislike of the Russian occupation of the Principalities but also by the fact that any show of sympathy for Russia might lead to a French attack on the Habsburg possessions in Italy, an attack in which Sardinia, marked since 1848 as the only serious Italian opponent of the Habsburgs, would join. In January 1854 the Tsar sent Count Orlov to Vienna in an effort to make Austria bind herself to benevolent neutrality in the war which Russia would clearly soon be waging with Britain and France. The mission was a failure. Far from giving Russia the help for which Nicholas and his ministers had hoped in 1853 Francis Joseph was unwilling to promise even neutrality unless Russia would undertake not to cross the Danube. She must also promise to evacuate the Principalities at the end of the war and agree to make no change in the territorial position of the Ottoman Empire whatever its outcome. Throughout February and March 1854 negotiations went on for a treaty between Britain, France, Austria and Prussia by which these powers would unite to demand the evacuation of the Principalities by Russia and the recognition by her of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. Nothing came of these, mainly because Frederick William IV of Prussia, faithful to the Russophil traditions of his family, refused to join the other powers in threatening Russia. On 20 April,
however, Prussia concluded with Austria a treaty by which the two
powers promised to co-operate if either were attacked and to force
an eventual Russian evacuation of the Principalities; but they agreed
132


ANGLO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS 1854
to go to war with Russia only if her armies crossed the Balkan mountains and threatened Constantinople — an almost impossible contingency. The effect of the treaty, therefore, was to make it clear that if she remained on the defensive Russia need fear no Austrian attack. She was thus strengthened in her resistance to Britain and France; while in May Frederick William IV broke with the liberal and pro-western influences in the Prussian government of which Prince William, the heir to the throne, was the leader, and began to follow a more Russophil line of policy. On 3 June Buol presented the long-awaited Austrian demand for the evacuation of the Principalities by Russia. Such an evacuation would strengthen rather than weaken Russia’s position. Without a guarantee of Austrian neutrality she could hardly continue to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia; and their evacuation had already been urged by Meyendorff on military grounds. But on 14 June, to the great anger of the Russians, Buol’s demand was followed by the conclusion of an Austro—Turkish treaty by which the Ottoman Empire transferred to Austria until the conclusion of peace its sovereign rights in the Principalities. This was seen in Vienna as the first step towards Austrian dominance or even annexation of Moldavia and Wallachia. On 29 June, under the urging of Frederick William IV, the Tsar with the greatest reluctance offered to evacuate the Principalities if Austria would prevent the British and French armies from entering them. The Russian occupation forces began their withdrawal towards the end of July; on 20 August Austrian troops began to replace them. The evacuation of the Principalities altered the whole course and shape of the war. The advance from Varna across the Danube in the direction of Odessa which had been projected by some British and French strategists was now impracticable with Moldavia and Wallachia in the hands of an at least ostensibly neutral state. The result was the expedition to the Crimea, with the aim of destroying Russian naval power in the Black Sea, which began with the landing of 50,000 British and French soldiers there in September 1854. The withdrawal of the Russians across the Pruth was also a great diplomatic victory for Austria, in some ways perhaps the greatest she won during the nineteenth century. But it was gained at heavy
1In particular Prussia, by allowing Russian trade to be re-routed through her ports, remained throughout the war one of the greatest obstacles to an effective Anglo-French blockade of Russia (Olive Anderson, ‘Economic Warfare in the Crimean War’, Economic History Review, 2nd series, xiv (1961-2), pp. 43-5).

cost, for it established in St. Petersburg a mood of bitter hostility and resentment towards her. The war, in spite of Buol’s success, was now more than ever a source of danger to her. If Britain and France pitched their peace terms high and if, as seemed by no means unlikely, Russian ill-feeling erupted in a declaration of war against Austria, the latter might find herself involved in a long struggle in which she was certain to suffer severely. Her geographical position meant that she was exposed to Russian attack in a way that Britain and France could never be. Moreover her internal disunity and the appeal which Russia might be able to make to the sympathies of her Slav and Orthodox subjects, coupled with the state of nearbankruptcy in which she continually found herself, made her even more vulnerable. The Austrian government was thus anxious to end the war as soon as possible; and the first step towards this end was to define and limit the Anglo-French war aims. This process was begun by Austro—French negotiations in Paris in July 1854 from which emerged the Four Points which were henceforth to be the essential war aims of the anti-Russian powers. These points were: the renunciation by Russia of her special rights in Serbia and the Principalities and their replacement by a general guarantee of the powers; free navigation of the Danube; the revision of the Straits Convention of 1841 ‘in the interests of the Balance of Power in Europe’; and the renunciation by Russia of any claim to a protectorate over the Orthodox Christians of the Ottoman Empire. The British government, under French pressure, accepted the Four Points on 29 July; they were given final validity as allied war-aims in an exchange of notes between Britain, France and Austria on 8 August. They were then sent by the Austrian government to St. Petersburg but indignantly rejected there; indeed Nesselrode had great difficulty in preventing the infuriated Tsar from declaring war on Austria.1 Only pressure from several directions — the mobilisation of the Austrian army on 22 October; the urging of Nesselrode and Frederick William IV; and the Russian defeats at the Alma and Inkerman — forced the Tsar eventually to accept the Four Points on 28 November. By then it was too late, for under British pressure their scope and implications had been drastically changed. Negotiations had also begun in July for an alliance between Austria and the western powers, though these were carried on with France alone, Britain remaining in the background. These negotiations were much slower to bear fruit than those over the Four Points, for with the Russian evacuation of the Principalities such an

ANGLO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS 1854
alliance had ceased to be urgent from the Austrian point of view.
Moreover the centring of the Anglo-French war effort on the
Crimea was highly unwelcome in Vienna. An Austro—Russian war, if it broke out, would be fought mainly in Galicia; and the British and French armies, terribly weakened by disease and incompetence during the winter of 1854-5, could be of no direct use whatever in such a struggle. Thus the general mobilisation of the Habsburg forces which was ordered on 22 October was cancelled a month later because of the continued opposition of the Austrian military leaders to war with Russia. However on 2 December an Anglo—FrancoAustrian alliance was eventually signed for the defence of the Principalities. It was agreed to by Francis Joseph only with considerable reluctance. Buol, now more than ever committed to an anti-Russian policy, together with the British and French ambassadors in Vienna, had to exert considerable pressure to secure his consent; and the action of the Prussian government on 26 November in guaranteeing the Austrian forces in the Principalities against Russian attack probably did as much as anything to make possible the signature of the treaty. As it was the Austrians insisted on the conclusion three weeks later of a convention with France by which Napoleon III guaranteed the Austrian position in Italy and thus removed, for the time being, one of the greatest bogies of Buol and his colleagues. In Britain also there was little enthusiasm for the treaty of 2 December. It was signed by the British government largely because the Prince Consort, and therefore the Queen, feared a new crop of revolutions in Europe if an effective anti-Russian alliance of the great powers were not established. The treaty therefore did little to end the disagreements of Britain with France, and of both with Austria, over the real aims of the anti-Russian alliance. In some ways it increased them. Neither in London nor in Paris was there any clear conception of what the war was to achieve. In Britain public opinion during the early months of the struggle was violently anti-Russian and much too sanguine in its expectations. “The people’, wrote Greville on 25 June, ‘are wild about this war, and besides the general confidence that we are to obtain very signal success in our naval and military operations, there is a violent desire to force the Emperor to make a very humiliating peace, and a strong conviction that he will very soon be compelled to do so.”! It was in this mood of ignorant optimism and without the slightest real grasp, even in the cabinet, of the realities of the military position, that the invasion of the Crimea was embarked
upon. In the same mood the British government, by the beginning 1 Op. cit. vii. 170.
135


1854-5 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 of December, had greatly expanded the third of the Four Points. The revision of the Straits Convention which it mentioned in very vague terms was now in London interpreted to mean the ending of Russian naval dominance in the Black Sea. The British government wished to specify the reduction in the strength of the Russian Black Sea fleet which should be demanded as a condition of peace, and also to make the destruction of Sevastopol’ a sine qua non in the peace negotiations. Such terms could be imposed only on a completely defeated Russia. If they were insisted upon they meant a long and expensive war. They did little, however, to satisfy the furious anti-Russian feeling which temporarily dominated Britain; and by the end of January 1855, faced by a House of Commons and a public opinion angered by the evidence of British military incompetence which the winter had provided, Aberdeen had been forced to resign. Palmerston, his successor in the premiership, was regarded as a living guarantee that the war would be carried on with vigour and that the terms inflicted on Russia would be severe. In Paris, however, anti-Russian feeling was far weaker than in London. As early as 28 January 1854 Cowley, the British ambassador, had told Clarendon, ‘You have no idea how the tide of public opinion is setting against us here’, and that ‘the idea of war has become so unpopular that I do not wonder at the Emperor wishing to back out’.! Moreover Napoleon III and his ministers, unlike the British cabinet, had from the beginning attached great importance to the Austrian alliance; and Austria had no interest in the destruction of Sevastopol’ and little in the weakening of the Russian Black Sea fleet. On 3 January 1855 Buol assured the Russian government that no demolition of Russian fortresses or limitation of the Russian Black Sea fleet would be demanded by the allies. The French government, therefore, favoured a much less exacting interpretation of the third of the Four Points than that advocated in London; but it was also determined not to jeopardise the alliance with Britain. It escaped from this dilemma by agreeing with the British government, in secret notes of 17 and 19 December 1854, on a very strict definition of the third of the Four Points (Sevastopol’ was to be destroyed and Russia permitted to keep only four warships on the Black Sea) while ten days later, by calculated duplicity, a much more restrained interpretation of the point was communicated to Vienna as that of Britain and France. But the fact that such disagreements existed and such subterfuges had to be resorted to showed how weak the AngloFrench alliance, and still more the Anglo—Austrian and FrancoAustrian ones, really were. 1 Wellesley, op. cit., p. 39.
136


ANGLO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS 1855
The same lesson was driven home by the unsuccessful proposal of
Napoleon ITI at the end of February 1855 that he should go to the Crimea and take personal command of the French army there. The British government feared that he might negotiate directly with Nicholas I if the latter also went to the Crimea. (The Tsar’s penchant for personal discussions of this kind between heads of state was well known.) Drouyn de Lhuys feared the loss of his post if the Emperor carried out his plan — after all Napoleon might be killed or wounded in battle — and thus tried to bring a speedy end to the war by jettisoning the secret notes of 17 and 19 December 1854 and proposing that the Russians be asked to agree merely not to increase their existing naval strength in the Black Sea. The fragility of the Anglo-French alliance had been once more displayed, though in April Napoleon abandoned the idea of going to the Crimea and Drouyn de Lhuys at once reverted to a more bellicose attitude. Disputes over whether and how far the Russian Black Sea fleet should be limited by the treaty which ended the war also dominated the abortive peace conference which met at Vienna on 15 March 1855 and continued to sit intermittently until 4 June. It was quickly agreed that Serbia and the Principalities should be placed under the protection of the powers and that navigation on the Danube should be controlled by an international commission. But a demand for the neutralisation of the Black Sea put forward by Drouyn de Lhuys was rejected by Prince A. M. Gorchakov, the Russian ambassador in Vienna, and also by Buol, though the latter was willing to insist on the limitation of the Russian Black Sea fleet to its pre-war strength. This latter proposal, coupled with an international guarantee of Turkish integrity and an Anglo—French—Austrian alliance to restrain Russian expansion in the Near East, was accepted by Drouyn de Lhuys and also by the British plenipotentiary, Lord John Russell. In both London and Paris there followed a struggle between the influences which favoured acceptance of the moderate Austrian terms and those which opposed them. In both capitals the extremists won, though in Paris the struggle was severe.t Both Drouyn de Lhuys and Russell were forced to resign and the gulf which separated Austria from the western powers, above all Britain, had been once
more emphasised. For the time being at least any prospect of active
Austrian help for Britain and France had vanished. On 4 June
Gorchakov refused to accept any limitation whatever of the Russian Black Sea fleet. This led at once to the breakdown of the conference,

was probably decisive in persuading Napoleon III to take a strong line.
137


1854-5 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
which was followed by the reduction of the Austrian army to its peace-time strength. The French and British negotiations with Austria had thus achieved little during the first year of the war. Britain and France had, however, been able to acquire one active supporter of some significance — the kingdom of Sardinia. Cavour, the Sardinian Prime Minister, had been asked by Britain! as early as April 1854, without success, to send a Sardinian contingent to the Near East. In December, as the weakness of the British forces in the Crimea and the preponderant role of France in the allied war effort began to arouse serious misgivings in London, the approach was renewed. The French government insisted that Sardinia’s entry into the struggle must be unconditional and that no promises could be made to her by the allies regarding the position in Italy. Any hint of concessions to Sardinia there might fatally jeopardise the newly-won Austrian alliance. After bitter struggles in Turin which culminated in the resignation of the Sardinian Foreign Minister, Dabormida, King Victor Emmanuel II enforced the acceptance of these terms. Sardinia adhered unconditionally to the Anglo-French alliance and signed a military convention with her new allies on 26 January 1855. Her expeditionary force of 15,000 men was to fight well in the Crimea and to do something to dilute the military dominance of France there. But it cannot be said that British and French diplomacy did much to weaken Russia during the greater part of 1855. Above all AngloFrench divisions continued. Far from curing them the evacuation of Sevastopol’ by the Russians in September, the one real military success won by the allies during the war, tended to increase them. Napoleon now wished to make the establishment of an independent Poland one of the main allied war aims.? The British government, though willing to agree to this in principle, had clearly no enthusiasm for the idea; a resurrected Poland might mean a new series of revolutionary wars which could engulf all Europe. Its half-heartedness greatly weakened Napoleon’s already flagging desire to continue the struggle. Moreover in Constantinople relations between Stratford de Redcliffe and Thouvenel, the French ambassador, were now very bad; Anglo-French rivalry in the Near East was as active as ever. These factors, and above all France’s war-weariness,
Or at least by the British minister to Turin, Sir James Hudson, who probably acted on his own initiative. * He had already stressed, in conversations in May and October 1854 with the Austrian minister to Paris, the need to recreate an independent Poland (A. von Hubner, Neuf ans de souvenirs d’un ambassadeur d’Autriche (Paris, 1904), i. 241, 270-1).

ANGLO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS 1855
explain the decision of the Emperor and his Council on 17 October that Buol should be encouraged to put forward allied peace terms in St. Petersburg. Napoleon also established direct contact with the Russian government, mainly through Seebach, the Saxon minister in Paris, who was Nesselrode’s son-in-law. Alexander II, who had succeeded his father Nicholas I on the latter’s death on 2 March, was far from ready for peace. Encouraging his generals with the memory of 1812, he prepared for a long campaign in 1856. But Russia’s position was very difficult. She had to maintain large forces in Poland, the Baltic provinces and the Caucasus (about 200,000 men in the last) as well as the Crimea. This, coupled with her poor internal communications and the need to guard against peasant revolts, meant that she was actually inferior in manpower to her enemies there during most of the war. Her military technology also was inferior to that of her opponents; her forces in the Caucasus were still armed in part with antiquated flintlock muskets. Her economic backwardness made a successful continuance of the war almost out of the question.? Moreover on 21 November 1855 Sweden agreed with Britain and France that she would cede no territory to Russia and allow the occupation of none by Russian troops. Any Russian demands of this kind would be communicated at once to the British and French governments, which would support Sweden in rejecting them. This agreement was not in itself a threat to Russia. But it showed clearly that Swedish sympathies lay with the western powers and emphasised Russian isolation. It had thus considerable psychological effect in St. Petersburg. It was also of some importance that Frederick William IV of Prussia, the one important European ruler who had shown sympathy for Russia, was now urging the early conclusion of peace since a long war might endanger the stability of monarchical government everywhere in Europe. “Subversive powers once unleashed,’ he wrote to Alexander IT, ‘who can calculate the results of a universal outbreak ?”? The decisive step in the making of peace was taken on 14. November, when Bourqueney, the French minister in Vienna, signed with Buol a protocol defining peace terms which the Austrian government would present to Russia in the form of an ultimatum. These
1 There were also contacts between Gorchakov and Morny, the Emperor’s halfbrother. 2 See the undated memorandum of D. A. Milyutin, later the greatest of all Russian War Ministers, in I. V.

1855-6 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
centred on two main points: Russia must accept the neutralisation
of the Black Sea and thus abandon her fleet and fortresses there; and she must cede to Moldavia territory at the mouth of the Danube (in other words part of south Bessarabia). ‘To these demands others might be added at the peace conference ‘in a European interest’. It is significant of the complete lack of real Anglo-French unity that these terms were agreed between Austria and France without any British participation whatever. The British government wished to make changes in them
— notably the neutralisation of the Aaland Islands and the Sea of Azov as well as the Black Sea, and a redrawing of Russia’s Caucasian frontier
— and it was not until 5 December that Anglo-French agreement on them was reached. It is even more significant that the terms, which involved prohibiting Turkey as well as Russia from having warships and arsenals in the Black Sea and which included provisions about the position of Christians in the Ottoman Empire, were drawn up without the Porte being consulted in any way. Yet the war had been fought allegedly to safeguard Turkish independence and Turkey and the western powers had agreed to make peace only in concert. The Austrian ultimatum was presented in St. Petersburg on 28 December by Count Esterhazy, the Austrian ambassador; and it was emphasised that its unconditional acceptance by Russia was demanded. The breach between Austria and Russia which had been opening for nearly two years was now a yawning chasm. When the Imperial Council met at the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg on 1 January 1856 it was clear that a majority of its members were in favour of peace because of Russia’s sheer inability to continue the war with any hope of success. On the 5th therefore the Austrian government was told that Russia accepted its demands, though she refused to cede any territory and rejected the idea of making any further concessions ‘in a European interest’. A week later Buol told Gorchakov that this was not the unconditional acceptance which had been demanded and that diplomatic relations with Russia would therefore be broken off on the 18th. On the 15th a second and decisive meeting of the Imperial Council took place.! Werther, the Prussian minister in St. Petersburg, had been told from Berlin only a few hours before it met that the Prussian government supported the Austrian demands and that he should urge the Russians to accept them. Russia’s position was thus more hopeless than ever; and the members of the Council were well aware of this. Nesselrode, who had always been anxious to avoid an open breach
The discussion at the meeting is usefully summarised in Meyendorff’s memorandum of 15 January in op. cit. iii. 214-17.
140


ANGLO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS 1856
with Austria, read a memoir urging acceptance of the Austrian terms. Peace, he argued, would give Russia a chance to undermine the hostile coalition which faced her. Count Vorontsov warned his colleagues that a long war would weaken Russia for many years and impose on her great losses in men, money and eventually territory. Count Kiselev feared revolt in Poland and perhaps trouble in Finland, Podolia and Volhynia if the struggle continued. Meyendorff stressed the appalling financial difficulties which faced the country and feared that a year or two more of war would reduce Russia to a position from which she would take half a century to recover. Only the Grand Duke Constantine, brother of the Tsar and a leading representative of the Old Russian and nationalist tendencies which had helped to produce the war, opposed acceptance of the Austrian terms. Alexander II, perhaps influenced by fear of internal upheaval and even revolution in Russia, took the Council’s advice. On 16 January the Russian government accepted the Austrian ultimatum; the end of the war was now in sight and preliminary peace terms were signed on 1 February. But the attitude of Austria had quite understandably provoked the most violent resentment in St. Petersburg. Gorchakov described Buol’s conduct as ‘unbelievable and indescribable’ and told the Austrian ministers frankly that he dreamed of revenge. Orlov and other Russian diplomats spoke of the Austrians with the greatest bitterness.1 The peace conference, attended by all the belligerents and by Austria and Prussia, opened in Paris on 25 February. All the participants had aims of their own which they wished to embody in the peace settlement. The British government wanted to weaken Russia strategically in every possible way; and on 1 March, the Russians had to agree to a special convention with Britain and France neutralising the Aaland Islands. But this was not to form part of the peace treaty; and British efforts to have the Sea of Azov neutralised and to create Circassian and Mingrelian buffer-states in the Caucasus between Russia and the Ottoman Empire had to be abandoned for lack of support. Pressure from Britain did, however, secure the return to the Turks of the great fortress of Kars which the Russians had taken towards the end of the war. France, unlike her ally, was anxious to treat Russia leniently. Napoleon III was willing in particular to make concessions over southern Bessarabia, where
the Russians were very anxious to limit their losses, and by 8 March
Clarendon, the British plenipotentiary, had to abandon his efforts to punish Russia more severely in this area.

141


1856-7 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 The Austrian government wished above all to strengthen its hold on the Principalities. The instructions which Buol took with him to Paris stressed the need to keep Moldavia and Wallachia separate (and thus more vulnerable to Austrian influence) and to secure for Austria the right to garrison Ismail or at least to station warships at the mouth of the Danube to protect Austrian navigation of the river. The Habsburg Empire had little success in achieving these aims. Buol had told Beust, the Saxon Foreign Minister, in 1855 that “we have the Danubian Principalities in our pocket’, but this proved a complete misapprehension. The one way in which Austria could have retained them was by handing over Lombardy and Venetia to Sardinia and thus gaining British and French support on the Danube at the cost of ceasing to be an Italian power. Palmerston had suggested such an exchange in 1854 and Napoleon III supported the idea in 1856, but to no effect. The Austrian government refused to consider it. Neither materially nor in terms of prestige were Moldavia and Wallachia an adequate compensation for the loss of Habsburg territory and influence in Italy. Austria was already under a treaty obligation to withdraw from the Principalities at the end of the war (by her convention with the Porte of 14 June 1854) and, deprived of British and French support there, in fact did so in March 1857. She had destroyed the former Russian dominance of Moldavia and Wallachia but failed to replace it by one of her own. The enforced Russian evacuation of the summer of 1854 and the Austro—Russian tension which followed had laid the foundations of Rumanian independence, not of an extension of Habsburg power. Prussia’s main objective at Paris was to assert and protect her status as a great power; and in this she had only indifferent success. Her presence at the peace conference was justified only by her being a signatory of the Straits Convention of 1841 and she was allowed to take part only in the discussions relating to its revision. The Sardinian government had at first hopes of some territorial gain from the conference. Cavour produced several complex schemes for establishing the Duke of Modena and Duchess of Parma in the Principalities and annexing their Italian territories to Sardinia. But these plans, typical of the eighteenth rather than nineteenth century, gained no support from any of the powers and had no chance of success. On 8 April Cavour, and more strikingly Clarendon, made speeches attacking Austrian dominance of Italy and the general misgovernment there; but though these were an index of the growing isolation of Austria they brought no immediate benefit to Sardinia. The Crimean War had been fought to protect the Ottoman
142


ANGLO-RUSSIAN RELATIONS 1856 Empire against Russian pressure. In the peace treaty which was
signed at Paris on 30 March 1856 Britain and Russia attempted to
achieve this objective in a number of ways. In the first place it was agreed that the powers, ‘desiring that the Sublime Porte should share in the advantages of the European concert’, should promise to respect the independence and integrity of the empire and jointly guarantee the strict observance of this promise. In the future any state in conflict with the Ottoman Empire was to seek the mediation ofa third power before resorting to arms. The Sultan for his part was to give guarantees of good treatment to his Christian subjects. He was also to communicate officially to the powers the hatti-humayun which he had issued on 18 February and which proclaimed religious equality throughout the empire, as well as economic improvements and the abolition of tax-farming and bribery. The powers declared their recognition of ‘the high value of this communication’. These provisions were the last great embodiment of the British dream of settling the Eastern Question by the creation of a really viable Ottoman Empire reformed from within by its own efforts and protected against attack by an international guarantee. Secondly and most important of all, the Black Sea was neutralised. Its waters were to be open to merchantmen of all nations and closed to all warships. No naval arsenals or dockyards could in future exist on its shores. It had long ceased to be a Turkish lake; it must never be allowed to become a Russian one. Thirdly the Principalities were no longer to be a Russian protectorate as they had been for a quarter of a century before 1854. They were to enjoy their privileges under Turkish suzerainty and the guarantee of the powers. No state was to exert any exclusive right of protection over them or to have any right of individual interference in their affairs. They were to have an ‘independent and national’ administration with their own army. A European commission was to ‘propose the bases of their future organisation’ and in each of them a divan (council) ad hoc was to be set up to express the wishes of the people on this subject. The application of the treaty in Moldavia and Wallachia and the settlement of their fate was to be for the next decade the most important and intractable issue in Near Eastern
politics. The treaty included other provisions of lesser importance. In particular the rights and immunities of Serbia were placed under the guarantee of the powers; henceforth the Porte could interfere
forcibly there only by previous agreement with them. The naviga
tion of the Danube was to be placed under the control of a European
commission. This, coupled with the cession by Russia of southern

1856 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 Bessarabia, destroyed, at least for the time being, any possibility of Russian control of the great river. These peace terms did not satisfy the extreme Russophobes in Britain. But in one respect at least— the demilitarisation of the Black Sea — they were extremely harsh and indeed unprecedented. Not until the even more stringent restrictions imposed on Germany in 1919 was a state to be forced to submit to so obvious and flagrant a limitation of its military freedom of action. Moreover while the demilitarisation continued Russia’s Black Sea coastline remained very vulnerable to attack by any great naval power which had Turkish support, perhaps even to attack by Turkey alone. It is not surprising that the nullification of this clause became at once and remained for the next fifteen years the prime objective of Russian policy in Europe. The peace settlement was buttressed by a separate treaty of 15 April by which Britain, France and Austria guaranteed the independence and integrity of the Ottoman Empire — an obviously anti-Russian agreement though Russia was not mentioned in the text. But like almost every other diplomatic initiative of the antiRussian powers during the Crimean War this one was undermined from the start by their dissensions. It was the product of Austrian pressure, since Buol saw well that after the war the Habsburg Empire would be faced by Russian hostility and regarded the treaty as a barrier to any future Russo—French alliance. It was also supported by the British government; the idea of such a treaty seems to have been originated by Russell in the spring of 1855. But Napoleon III, now that Russo—French relations were rapidly improving and that he was thinking in terms of Russian support for his Italian ambitions, was very unenthusiastic. At first he objected altogether to such a treaty; and even when British pressure forced him to agree to it he refused to accept a secret article binding the signatories to consult if Russian military or naval preparations should seem to threaten the Ottoman Empire. After it had been signed he tried to delay its publication, successfully opposed a suggestion that Prussia be invited to adhere to it, and even apologised to Orlov, who with Brunnow represented Russia at the peace conference, for having signed it.’ From the beginning the treaty was a demonstration of Austro-British distrust of Russia and little more. Like the demilitarisation of the Black Sea it provoked Russia without doing much in the long run to help the Turks.
* The Austrian minister in Paris had already noted in his diary on 7 March that ‘the French plenipotentiaries are more Russian than Orloff and Brunnow themselves’ (Hiibner, op. cit. i. 401).

It is now almost a truism to say that the significance of the Crimean War rests upon its influence on the structure of European politics rather than upon its results in the Near East. Its greatest single achievement was to make Russia a revisionist power, to end the stress on conservative solidarity and maintenance of the status
quo which had dominated the outlook of Nicholas I and replace

them by a concentration on purely Russian interests, many of which lay outside Europe. Until 1853 the spirit of the Holy Alliance, though enfeebled, was still a force to be reckoned with in European politics. The Crimean War gave it its death-blow, and the changed attitude of Russia was aptly symbolised by the replacement in St. Petersburg of the elderly, conservative, even Austrophil German Nesselrode by the younger, Austrophobe Russian Gorchakov. A long memorandum of February 1856 in which Nesselrode urged that even now Austria should be treated with consideration, that no alliance should be made with France and that Russia’s policy should remain conservative, monarchical and anti-Polish, produced no effect in St. Petersburg. Its failure marked the end of the spirit which had dominated Russian relations with Europe during the reign of Nicholas I. The sufferer from this change in Russia’s attitude was the Habsburg Empire. Prussia had played an inglorious role during the war. She had barely secured admission to the peace conference and her status as a great power seemed in doubt. Yet she had one important negative achievement to her credit. She had not alienated any of the great powers. She had not complicated and compromised her future position as Austria had done by antagonising Russia. The Habsburg Empire, internally still very weak, now found itself effectively isolated. Faced in Italy by the ambitions of Napoleon III and the greed of Sardinia, in Germany by a Prussia in which hostile forces might soon gain the upper hand, it could no longer call on Russia for the support which had been so important to it in the past. The most dynamic decade of the century 1815-1914, the decade which was to see the unification of Italy and Germany, was now beginning. The successes of Bismarck and Cavour were to be made possible by the isolation and relative weakness of Austria. Their foundations had been laid by the Crimean War. In the Near East the one great constructive result of the war was the part it played in beginning the creation of an independent Rumania. Apart from this it achieved little. The new provisions regarding Serbia were of secondary importance. So was the creation of the Danube Commission, in spite of its practical success in improving the navigation of the river. The demilitarisation of the Black Sea and the loss by Russia of southern Bessarabia had greater political significance; but both were relatively short-lived. Neither did much to weaken Russia, for her ultimate weaknesses were economic ones and the war did nothing to increase them. On the contrary, it accelerated the painful process of technological change and social reconstruction which she so much needed to undergo. Above all the reform of the Ottoman Empire, from which so much

But the speed with which these changes were introduced was painfully slow, and there was the usual gulf between the promulgation of a decree and its carrying-out to infuriate British statesmen and diplomats.” Moreover outside pressure for change generated inevitable Turkish resistance, a resistance which became more pronounced with the accession to the throne in January 1861 of the new Sultan, Abdul Aziz. Even before this there was growing doubt on the part of many observers of the ability and even the willingness of the Turks to reform their empire. But if the collapse of the Ottoman Empire were inevitable could the Crimean War be justified? ‘According to my view,’ wrote Edmund Hornby, the British representative on the international commission which had been set up to supervise the expenditure of the second Turkish loan, ‘the Treaty of Paris .. . was a huge diplomatic blunder. It freed Turkey from the fear of Russia and left her to misgovern her Christian subjects as she pleased, which she forthwith proceeded to do. I know that although during the war, and immediately after it, neither Lord Stratford nor myself acting under his orders felt much difficulty in getting the Turks to consent to reforms... yet within eighteen months of the treaty it was impossible to do anything with them.”* This was written
1 As early as September 1856 there were fears that the Turkish government might default on its interest payments (Olive Anderson, ‘Great Britain and the Beginnings of the Ottoman Public Debt, 1854-55’, Historical Journal, vii (1964), p. 63). 2 Thouvenel, the French ambassador, refused altogether to press for reform of the empire. 3 Sir Edmund Hornby, an Autobiography (London, 1929), pp. 80-1.

long after the war, when the weaknesses of the Turkish reform movement had become cruelly visible. Few Englishmen in the years immediately after 1856 would have agreed that the Crimean War was merely a blunder; but this pessimistic view of the Ottoman Empire and its prospects was becoming steadily more widespread in western Europe. The events of the following decades could only strengthen it.

the Bosnian Revolt
1856-75
For two decades after 1856 there was no major crisis in the Near East. The relations of the great powers were often strained by events there, but never to breaking-point or even near it. This was not because the position had been genuinely stabilised. It was rather because the great powers had their attention focused elsewhere and were unwilling to allow events in the crumbling Ottoman Empire to threaten international peace. The Habsburg Empire, which for two generations had in any case been a hesitant and ineffective force in the Near East, was now fighting for its position in Italy and Germany, for its unity and great power status, even for its existence. To Napoleon III the fate of the Ottoman Empire was of secondary importance by comparison with that of Italy and Germany, or with his grandiose and half-formulated plans for a general redrawing of European frontiers. ‘To Russia, it is true, the Straits, the Black Sea and the Caucasus were always of paramount significance; the need to nullify the Black Sea clauses of the peace of 1856 was never for long lost to sight. Yet in the later 1850s the expansion of her territory and influence in the Far East at the expense of China, in the 1860s and 1870s the growth of a great colonial empire in central Asia, did something to deflect her energies away from the Near East and even from Europe in general. In Britain there was less willingness than in the period 1840-56 to take active steps to preserve the Ottoman Empire, whether this unwillingness took the form of cynicism about its value and prospects of survival, as with Foreign Secretaries such as Lords Clarendon and Stanley, or genuine pacifist and internationalist idealism, as with Cobden and Bright. Yet the weakening and disintegration of Turkey continued remorselessly. In the Danubian principalities the demand for unity was growing. In Syria and Crete unrest was coming to a head. The very ancient idea of a canal through the isthmus of Suez was
149


1830-55 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
beginning to assume a concrete form, with profound implications for the trade and politics of the world. Overhanging the whole situation was the spectre of nationalism, a nationalism which was now beginning to affect the Turks themselves as well as their Balkan subjects. Connected with it was the threat (a rather empty one as events were to prove) of Panslavism with its implication of Russian dominance of east-central and south-eastern Europe. And these accumulating difficulties had to be faced by an Ottoman Empire which was still largely unreformed and very badly governed, and which was more and more crippled financially by its efforts to maintain armed forces more expensive than its primitive economy could sustain. During this period, therefore, the Near East continued to be a fertile source of international friction, though this friction was never allowed to reach dangerous proportions.
Throughout the decade which followed the peace of 1856 the powers were intermittently plagued by the question of the Danubian principalities. For over twenty years before the Crimean War these principalities had been dominated by Russia. The Réglement Organique, the new constitution introduced in Wallachia in 1831 and in Moldavia during the following year, had been drawn up under strong Russian influence and had been approved in St. Petersburg before its introduction. Count Kiselev, who supervised the drawingup of the Réglement, had even proposed the annexation of the Principalities to Russia; and the Russian forces which suppressed the 1848 revolutions there did not leave until 1851. But this Russian domination was never popular, as the events of 1848 had shown. In 1854, with the final departure of Russian occupation forces, it disappeared completely. There was now in both principalities considerable feeling in favour of unity. The customs-barriers between them had been abolished in 1847; and since about 1830 a sense of Rumanian nationality (which owed much to the Rumanians of Transylvania, still under Austrian rule) had been developing. Moreover this feeling was already receiving some French encouragement; during the unsuccessful Vienna conference of March—June 1855 Bourqueney had proposed that the Principalities be united under a hereditary prince, on the model of Serbia and Egypt, as a barrier to Russian influence in the Balkans. The peace negotiations at Paris made still clearer the sympathy of Napoleon III for the cause of union and his low opinion of the Ottoman Empire.! They also made it clear that
* Alice E, Mange, The Near Eastern Policy of the Emperor Napoleon III (Urbana,
1940); P- 74150


CRIMEAN WAR—BOSNIAN REVOLT 1856-7
such a union would be opposed by the Austrians and the Turks.
Buol, disappointed in his ambitions on the lower Danube and afraid
of unrest in Transylvania if a united Rumania were formed, argued
that the weakness and anarchy which had plagued the kingdom of
Greece from its foundation were good arguments against the creation of more small Balkan states. Ali Pasha, the Turkish plenipotentiary at Paris, feared that the hereditary ruler of a merely autonomous Rumanian state would be tempted to ask for Russian help towards the achievement of complete independence. Clarendon and Cowley, the British representatives, gave rather lukewarm approval to the idea of union, or at least to its discussion, but were strongly opposed on this point by the still powerful Stratford de Redcliffe. The disunity of the anti-Russian powers meant that, as has been seen, it was finally agreed merely that divans ad hoc should be elected in the Principalities and that a commission of representatives of the powers should investigate their wishes as regarded union and then report to a new conference. This roundabout and temporising procedure soon ran into difficulties. By the early autumn of 1856 Clarendon, impressed by the arguments of the Porte, was becoming more and more hostile to union. Napoleon III, on the other hand, was increasingly a sincere believer in the principle of nationalism and less and less willing to give way (though Thouvenel and Persigny, the French ambassadors in Constantinople and London did not favour union of the Principalities, which was very much a personal policy of the Emperor). Moreover the Moldavian elections, when they took place in July 1857, had clearly been rigged by Vogorides, the Kaimakam (DeputyGovernor) appointed by the Porte to administer the province, and by Catargi, his Minister of the Interior.1 The result was that Thouvenel, backed by the Russian, Prussian and Sardinian representatives at Constantinople, at once demanded their annulment. On 5, August, when this demand was refused a second time, he broke off relations with the Porte. It was now clear, as the Bolgrad and Serpents Island disputes had already hinted, that the relationships of the great powers in the Near East were changing. More and more France and Russia were tending to co-operate there. Already they were supporting Danilo II, ruler of the pseudo-state of Montenegro, in his frontier-disputes with the Porte;? and in September Napoleon III and Alexander II, in a
1 Only a minority of those entitled to vote were allowed to place their names on the electoral rolls; and of this minority only a minority voted. 2 These culminated, in May 1858, in the crushing defeat of the Turks by the Montenegrins at Grahovo. By a protocol of 8 November of that year, the great

meeting at Stuttgart which aroused widespread interest and speculation, agreed to work together in the Balkans and to consult each other if the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire seemed imminent. The rift which was already opening between Britain and France in the Near East was certain to be widened by their differing attitudes to the Principalities. But neither the British nor the French government was willing to allow matters to come to a crisis. Napoleon III still attached great importance to his alliance with Britain. Clarendon did not regard the fate of Moldavia, ‘a little barbarous province at the end of Europe’, as important enough to justify a breach with France. On 6-10 August 1857 the Emperor visited Queen Victoria at Osborne in the Isle of Wight. During the visit (apparently, though this is not certain, on the 9th) a compromise was reached. Clarendon agreed to advise the Porte to nullify the Moldavian elections; for his part Napoleon undertook to support merely a “broad administrative union’ of the two provinces. This would leave each under the rule of its own Hospodar. New elections were therefore held in both Principalities in September; and in October the divans which they produced voted overwhelmingly in favour of union. The obstacles to this were still very formidable, however. When in May 1858 the representatives of the powers which had signed the peace treaty of 1856 met in Paris to receive the report of the commission which had been sent to Moldavia and Wallachia, and to work out a constitution for the Principalities, deep disagreements were still only too visible. Walewski, supported by Kiselev, now | Russian ambassador in Paris, urged the creation of a ‘central commission’ with powers over both Principalities, which were to have a common flag, currency, army and postal system. This would have turned the ‘broad administrative union’ of Osborne into something almost indistinguishable from political unity. It was therefore violently opposed by Austria and to a lesser extent by Britain and the Porte. Finally on 19 August another compromise was arrived at, but an obviously unstable and illogical one. Each province was to have its own flag; but to both should be attached an identical blue pennant, Each was to have its own militia; but they should form two parts of the same army. Each was to choose, for life, its own Hospodar; but there was nothing to prevent the same individual being elected by the divans at Bucharest and Jassy. A
powers, together with Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire, agreed that the frontier should be delimited by a European commission on the basis of the status quo of 1856. Franco—Russian efforts to give Montenegro a little more territory failed in the face of British and Austrian opposition.

commission chosen by the Hospodars and the divans was to meet at
Focshani, where it would draw up a code of laws for both Moldavia
and Wallachia and prepare legislation for submission to each of the two governments. This awkward halfway-house, neither real unity nor genuine division, could not be lasting. What might have been anticipated (and what Buol had in fact anticipated) happened. On 17 January 1859 the boyar Alexander Cuza was elected, to his own surprise, Hospodar of Moldavia. On 5 February, after a good deal of disorder, the divan in Bucharest unanimously chose him as Hospodar of Wallachia. Neither of the elections was prearranged and neither seems to have been influenced by France or Russia. Indeed Cuza was widely regarded as a mere stopgap until some foreign prince could be placed upon the throne of the united Principalities. Moreover the Porte at first refused to recognise his election, while Austria marked her extreme displeasure by withdrawing her consuls from Moldavia and Wallachia. In fact Cuza maintained himself in power, though with increasing difficulty, for seven years. Lord Malmesbury, the British Foreign Secretary, urged from the first that the Porte should accept him unless it were clear that his election would have undesirable results. More important, the outbreak of war between France and Austria in Italy in May 1859, and the rapid Austrian defeat, made it difficult for the Habsburgs actively to resist the tide of events in the Principalities. Indeed the boot was now on the other foot; for during the Austro—French war Cuza received arms from France and negotiated with General Klapka, the Hungarian nationalist leader, in the hope of stimulating an anti-Habsburg revolt in Hungary and seizing the Bukovina for himself.t Deprived of British and Austrian support, the Porte was forced, on 31 May, to recognise him as ruler of both Principalities. On 6 September the representatives of the powers in Paris formally confirmed his position. This still fell a good deal short of an organic union of Moldavia and Wallachia; but in both London and Vienna the inevitability of such a union was now more and more taken for granted. Moreover the dominance of French influence at Constantinople, which had been noticeable since 1856 and particularly since Stratford’s departure in December 1857, was now more marked than ever and told heavily in favour of nascent Rumanian nationalism. On 2 December 1861 a further step towards union was taken when the

1860-6 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 Porte with the agreement of the powers (a reluctant one in the cases of Austria and Russia) issued a firman providing for the creation of a single ministry and assembly, which were to sit at Bucharest.* The new arrangement, however, was to have effect only during Cuza’s reign; under his successors each of the Principalities would, as in the past, elect its own Hospodar. Like the convention of 19 August 1858, this concession was a grudging and untenable compromise. Uncertainty about the future and the highly personal, factional and irresponsible character of Rumanian politics? were, by the early 1860s, making Cuza’s regime increasingly unpopular. Simultaneously his efforts to destroy the system of Capitulations in the Principalities and subject foreigners to the Rumanian taxation and judicial system involved him in much petty friction with the powers. More and more he now looked to the peasantry for support against his boyar rivals and in May 1864, in a coup d’état very similar to that of 2 December 1851 in Paris, he dissolved the Assembly and promulgated a new constitution and electoral law which were at once approved by a referendum. At the end of June the Porte, in agreement with the ambassadors of the powers in Constantinople, approved the new constitution; it also agreed that in future Moldavia and Wallachia should be able to change their internal administration without outside interference. By now it was clear that the real obstacles to the development of a Rumanian state came not from Britain or the Porte, or even from Austria, increasingly preoccupied by events in Germany, but from the internal weaknesses of the Principalities. Their financial position in particular was now acutely difficult; and by the end of 1865 Cuza had made it clear that he was prepared to abdicate his tottering throne in favour of some foreign prince. During the night of 22-3 February 1866 he was overthrown by a bloodless coup d’état in Bucharest and the throne was offered to Count Philip of Flanders, second son of King Leopold I of the Belgians. This revolution was by no means welcome in Constantinople, where it was feared that the Rumanian example might inspire other provinces of the empire to aim at independence or at least autonomy. The Porte would much have preferred as ruler of

CRIMEAN WAR—BOSNIAN REVOLT 1866 the Principalities a native Hospodar nominated by the powers for a
period of six or seven years. In Russia also, though Gorchakov had always been annoyed by Cuza’s Francophil tendencies, there were fears that the fall of the Hospodar might mean the annexation of the Principalities by Austria as a compensation for the Italian territory she had lost in 1859. But the British and French governments were unwilling to defend the convention of August 1858, which both Russia and the Porte wished to uphold; and on 15 April, after the Count of Flanders had withdrawn, a plebiscite elected Charles of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen ruler of Rumania by an overwhelming majority. By mid-June the international position had been transformed by the outbreak of the Austro—Prussian war and Russia was being forced to modify her attitude. In October, therefore, the Sultan, making the best of a bad job, invested Charles with his new office. By the end of the year the changed position in the Principalities had been accepted by all the powers. A fully independent and united Rumania was now well on the way to creation. The Turkish suzerainty to which Moldavia and Wallachia were still subject was more purely formal than ever; and Charles of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen was to occupy the throne for nearly half a century. In some ways the future was far from bright. A new constitution of 1866 disfranchised most of the peasants to whom Cuza had given the vote and also refused political rights to the feared and hated Jewish minority. The country remained economically very weak. The injustices and inequalities of its society were gross even by the standards of the 1860s. Its ruling class, the boyar landowners, was perhaps the most corrupt, irresponsible and incompetent in Europe. The emergence of Rumania, like that of Greece and Serbia, illustrated the emotional power and statebuilding potentialities of the national idea in nineteenth-century Europe. Like Greece and Serbia the new state also showed the complete inability of national feeling by itself to solve social and economic problems. Internationally the emergence of a united Rumania was a victory for France. It marked Napoleon III, quite fairly, as one of the very few European statesmen to whom the idea of nationality made a genuine appeal. It was also an important change in the Near Eastern status quo established in 1856; and thus indirectly
strengthened Russia’s case for a revision of the Paris settlement and
the nullification of the Black Sea clauses of the treaty. It could be
argued in St. Petersburg that the settlement must stand or fall as a
whole and that the violation of one part of it deprived the entire
structure of at least its moral validity. Lord John Russell, now Prime

Minister, admitted early in May 1866 that if the clauses of the treaty
of Paris which referred to the Principalities were altered against
Russia’s wishes she was entitled to some compensation. A denuncia
tion of the Black Sea clauses of the treaty was seriously considered in St. Petersburg in the late summer and early autumn of 1866 and a circular announcing that Russia had ceased to recognise them was prepared for transmission to Russian diplomats abroad. ‘The idea of such a denunciation was abandoned as premature because of the opposition of the Ministers for War and Finance; but this was merely a postponement, and was seen as such by all the Russian statesmen concerned. Within a decade of its signature the treaty of Paris was already moribund. If any further proof were needed of the instability and incompetence of Turkish rule, it was provided by the severe friction between Druses and Maronites which developed in the Lebanon in 1859 and which, by the end of May 1860, had erupted in civil war between the two communities.t On 9 July the massacre in Damascus of many Christians, including the Dutch consul, made it impossible for the European powers not to intervene. Already on the 6th the French government, whose traditional interest in Syria was far stronger than that of any other in Europe, had proposed the sending to the Lebanon of an international commission to investigate the position there. On the 17th, after news of the Damascus massacre had reached Paris, Napoleon III and Thouvenel (now French Foreign Minister) decided on armed intervention. Two days later they proposed to the other great powers the sending to Syria of a joint expeditionary force the majority of which would be supplied by France. The British government did not like the idea of a French army in Syria and the growth of French influence there which it was likely to produce. Its suspicions were fully justified, for it now seems likely that the main motive behind the French intervention was not to protect the Maronites but to force the Sultan to abandon his opposition to the proposed Suez Canal, work on which had begun in 1859.” Also there were dreams in Paris of setting up Abd-el-Kader, the Algerian tribal leader who had been exiled to Syria by the French after his surrender to them in December 1847 and who was receiving a French pension, as ruler of an independent Syrian state.®

Nothing of these schemes was known in London; but there were plenty of other reasons for distrusting Napoleon III. His annexation
of Nice and Savoy in March 1860; the threat which new French ironclad warships seemed to offer to British security; the FrancoRussian rapprochement which had obviously been developing for some years — all these made a growth of French influence in Syria or anywhere else highly unwelcome. Moreover foreign military intervention in Syria might set an inconvenient precedent for similar action elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire. At the end of July the Russian government proposed that the powers, if they agreed to French action in Syria, should also agree to improve, by arrangement with the Porte, the position of Christians all over the Ottoman Empire. In case of further outbreaks of violence they should act elsewhere as they were doing in the Lebanon. This proposal, which opened a very dangerous door to future Russian military action in the Balkans, was strongly opposed by the British and Turkish governments; and since Napoleon III failed to support him Gorchakov was forced to withdraw it. The result of British distrust was that not until 3 August did the powers sign a protocol for the despatch to the Lebanon of a force of 12,000 men of which half was to be provided by France. This European intervention was to last only six months and no state (France was of course meant) was to make territorial or other gains from it. Meanwhile the Porte, in an effort to stave off European intervention, had sent the Turkish Foreign Minister, Fuad Pasha, to the Lebanon as its special commissioner. When the French expeditionary force landed at Beyrut on 16 August it was not long before quarrels developed between him and its commander, General Beaufort d’Hautpoul. It rapidly became clear that the Porte was anxious to end as quickly as possible what to it appeared simply a French military occupation of part of Syria, In their efforts to do this the Turks pointed out that disorder had largely ceased (in part because of the severe and indiscriminate punishments inflicted by Fuad on Turkish officials and officers in the area) before the arrival of the French. And the attempts of the Porte to rid itself of this unwelcome French aid were, needless to say, supported by Britain. Gorchakov now intensified the efforts which he had been making since 1856 to divide Britain from France? and to strengthen Russia’s relations with Napoleon III. In a memorandum of 25 September, Thouvenel agreed that if new disorders broke out in the Ottoman
Empire and no joint intervention by the powers were possible France

would not object to action by Russia alone to protect the Bulgarians.
If the empire collapsed and had to be partitioned France and Russia
would act in concert to ensure that the European balance was not
overturned as a result. The Crimean alliance of Britain and France was now dead and buried. The French government, understandably enough, refused to withdraw its forces from Syria until something had been done to stabilise the position in the Lebanon; and on 19 February 1861 a conference opened in Paris for this purpose. It was also to fix a date for the end of the French occupation.1 The Turkish representative successfully opposed a French suggestion that the administration of the whole of Syria should be reorganised; and by the end of May, after a good deal of discussion between the Porte and the ambassadors of the powers in Constantinople, agreement on a new regime for the Lebanon alone had been reached. The province was to become autonomous, though within narrowly restricted geographical limits; and this status could not be altered by Turkey without the consent of the powers. A Christian governor, who was not to be a Lebanese, was to be appointed by the Porte for a period of years with the assent of the powers. There was to be a Lebanese gendarmerie independent of Turkish control. The governor was to rule with a council (mejliss) on which the main Lebanese religious groups would have equal representation; and the province was to be divided for local government purposes into six cazas each of which would be populated, as far as possible, by adherents of only one church. These provisions were incorporated in a réglement signed by Turkey and the powers on g June. Its signature coincided with the withdrawal of the French expeditionary force. Considering how turbulent the history of the province had been for the past generation the Lebanese settlement of 1861 proved remarkably successful. Apart from some disorder provoked in 1864-7 by the Maronite radical Joseph Karam the Lebanon enjoyed internal peace for several decades to come. But the new regime clearly marked another defeat for the idea of preserving the unity and integrity of the Ottoman Empire. The Porte had been deprived, though deservedly, of effective control of yet another part of its territory, a part which though small was strategically important and relatively wealthy. To the autonomy of the Danubian principalities, Tunis, Serbia and Samos? was now added that of the

Lebanon. The failure of Ottoman government and society to make
headway against the difficulties which faced them was clearer than
ever. The same point was once more driven home by the Cretan revolt of 1866-8. Crete had for long been one of the most ungovernable parts of the Ottoman Empire. But the revolt which broke out there in the summer of 1866 was more than a mere protest against misgovernment. It was also inspired by an awkward demand, which the best possible Turkish administration could not wholly destroy, for union with Greece. The natural sympathy felt in Greece for the rebels did more than anything else to give the revolt international importance. Greek volunteers flocked to the island. Greek public opinion became even more anti-Turkish than usual. On 14 August 1866 the government in Athens called on the powers to intervene on behalf of the rebels. By the end of the year it was demanding the cession of Crete to Greece. ! The instability of Greek politics! and the general poverty and backwardness of the country had lowered her standing in the eyes of the powers so much that none of them felt great sympathy with this demand. In particular the Russian government to which many Greeks looked for support remained cautious and hesitant, though both Russian public opinion and General N. P. Ignatiev, the active and headstrong ambassador in Constantinople, urged a pro-Greek policy. Russia’s internal position was difficult; it was in April 1866 that the effort of the student Karakhozov to murder Alexander II first showed unmistakably to what extreme lengths discontent might now go. Its financial position was equally difficult; an aggressive foreign policy was for it an expensive luxury. Moreover it had now embarked on a great territorial expansion in central Asia which was certain to absorb resources for some time to come and to complicate its relations with Britain. For all these reasons Gorchakov was unwilling to take any action over Crete unless with some support from the other powers, and above all from France. For a time this French support seemed likely to be forthcoming. Napoleon III, angered and alarmed by the outcome of the Austro—Prussian war of June-July 1866, was anxious for Russia’s support in western Europe and thus willing to make concessions to her in the Near East. On 23 January 1867 Moustier, the new French Foreign Minister, proposed that the Turks be forced to cede Crete, Thessaly

and Epirus to Greece. When this had been done France and Russia should unite to safeguard what remained of the Ottoman Empire, to ‘offer and guarantee to the Ottoman government all the conditions of security and vitality which are indispensible to her’.* In return Russia must support France in western Europe. This ambitious plan fell flat. The Russian government naturally wished to know before committing itself what France’s ambitions in western Europe were; and Napoleon and his ministers were themselves quite unable to answer this question. Moreover the Russians, as Gorchakov openly admitted, were interested only in the Orthodox Christians under Turkish rule. They did not wish to destroy the Ottoman Empire. But unlike France they had no desire to see it become stronger. Moreover they disliked the increase of French and Greek influence in the Balkans which Moustier’s scheme seemed to imply. What they really wished for was the division of the Ottoman Empire into a number of autonomous regions, each with its own elected leaders. Also both the British and Austrian governments continued to oppose any loss of territory by the Turks unless it were unavoidable. Lord Stanley, the British Foreign Secretary, agreed in January 1867, under pressure from France and Russia, to support the grant of autonomy to Crete. But he did so only on condition that no undue pressure be put on the Porte to assent to this and that no further action be taken if it refused — provisos which sabotaged the plan from the start. At the end of April, he refused to join the other powers in urging at Constantinople an end to hostilities in Crete and the setting-up of an international commission to enquire into Cretan grievances. The result was that when representations of this kind were made in June the Porte was able to disregard them. The Turkish position was strengthened above all by the fact that the summer of 1867 saw the end of the Franco—Russian co-operation which for nearly a decade had been important in the Near East. When Alexander II visited Paris in May, Gorchakov had a series of personal discussions with Moustier but failed to get what he wanted — French support for the annexation of Crete by Greece and for a diplomatic campaign to improve the position of the Christians under Turkish rule. Three months later, when Napoleon met Francis Joseph at Salzburg, there were suspicions in St. Petersburg that some alliance or at least understanding between France and Austria was under discussion. France, increasingly alienated from Russia, was now hesitating between a new effort at alliance with the tsarist regime, an understanding with Austria and an entente with Britain.

The position of the Porte vis-a-vis the Cretan rebels was thus
stronger than it seemed in 1867. The Turks realised that only Russia had any genuine interest in the fate of Crete; and by the end of August they had made it clear that they would not cede the island or agree to a European enquiry into conditions there. Pressure from the powers compelled them, on 12 September, to proclaim an amnesty in the island and at the end of October to announce a scheme of reforms to be introduced there. But these proved so disappointing (in particular they did not provide for the island to have a Christian governor) that France, Russia, Italy and Prussia declared their intervention in the Cretan question at an end and washed their hands of all responsibility for its outcome. The crisis, insofar as it had ever really existed, had now been reduced to an essentially Greco—Turkish one. In February 1868 Ignatiev, who had throughout pursued an independent policy which was sometimes a serious nuisance to Gorchakov, proposed another Russian effort to secure European intervention on behalf of the Cretans. But Gorchakov showed no enthusiasm for this and the French government, preoccupied in Italy and on the Rhine, turned the idea down very firmly. “The Cretan question has been closed with the assent of the Russian government’, wrote Moustier, ‘and we do not wish to reopen it under any pretext.”! By the end of 1868 the continued sending of Greek volunteers to Crete had brought Greece and Turkey very near to war. In December relations between them were broken offand the Porte threatened to expel all Greek subjects from its territory. But the powers, tired of the whole question and despising equally both Greeks and Turks,? were determined not to allow a war to break out. On 2 January 1869, when the revolt in Crete was clearly at its last gasp, Napoleon III invited the great powers and the Porte, at the suggestion of Bismarck, to a conference at Paris (the Greek government was offered merely consultative status and therefore withdrew from the conference as soon as it opened). On 20 January this issued a general declaration on the duties of neutrals, forbade Greece to allow further recruiting of volunteers for use in Crete, and ordered
her to compensate Turkish subjects who had suffered as a result of

1814-69 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
her activities in the island. The revolt there had already collapsed; and early in February a new Greek government accepted the Paris declaration. On this subdued note the Cretan crisis ended. It had exposed once more, if any exposure were needed, the badness of Ottoman administration. But its successful suppression showed, as the Armenian massacres were to do a generation later, that if the powers were divided and no one of them deeply involved the Porte could still enjoy a free hand in the suppression of a rebellious national minority. In 1866-9 no power except Russia cared much what happened to the Cretans; and even Russia’s interest in them was effectively limited by her weakness and her other commitments. Moreover the logical outcome of the Cretan revolt if it were successful was union with Greece. Autonomy could hardly be more than a stepping-stone to this end. No European statesman in the 1860s could feel any enthusiasm for the Greek state established over a generation earlier; its aggressiveness and misgovernment made it appear a danger to peace. To hand over Crete to it might be to strengthen the forces making for instability in the Near East. For these reasons the Cretans were left to endure another generation of Ottoman rule. Crete was by no means the only or the most important area in which the growing national feeling of the Balkan peoples was to be seen in the 1860s. The primitive nationalism with very powerful religious overtones which had become visible in Serbia and Greece early in the century was now clearly gaining ground in Bulgaria. The slow cultural renaissance which laid the foundations of Bulgarian nationalism began with the publication of religious works by H. J. Kirchovskii and K. Puchinovich in 1814 and 1816. In 1829 Y. Venelin published The Bulgarians Ancient and Modern, the first effort at historical writing in the vernacular, and in 1835 a modern school, the first in Bulgaria, was opened at Gabrovo. During the next generation the growth of trade with western Europe slowly produced a number of businessmen with some knowledge of German or French and with contacts in Paris, Vienna or Leipzig. Simultaneously the few western schools in the Ottoman Empire produced a very small number of well-educated Bulgarians with some real understanding of western life and ideas. Above all contacts with Russia grew rapidly from 1858 onwards, as Panslavism attracted more and more the support of the Russian educated classes. Bulgarian students at Russian universities, Bulgarian merchant colonies in Russia, above all that at Odessa, were now by far the most important means by which foreign influences were brought to bear 1 See pp. 254-9.

on the country.! From all these sources, British, French and German philosophy and political thought flowed into Bulgaria. National feeling there was not at first irreconcilably anti-Turkish. What some of its early leaders aimed at was merely a privileged status within the Ottoman Empire. If Bulgaria were given autonomy, a Christian governor subordinate to the Sultan, its own church, a representative assembly of some kind and the right to use its own language for official purposes, they would have been quite prepared to recognise the Sultan as Tsar of the new autonomous state, just as the Austrian Emperor was also King of Hungary. Proposals along these lines were put forward by the main nationalist organisation, the Secret Central Committee, as late as 1867. Nor was the idea that the Bulgarians might have an important role to play within the Empire unknown in Constantinople. ‘Learn our language to become our Officials’, said a Turkish minister to a Bulgarian delegation in the 1860s, ‘and you will be for us what the Magyars are for Austria.” It was only after the Crimean War that leaders such as G. S. Rakovskii, and on his death in 1867 Lyuben Karavelov, began to demand the creation of an independent Bulgarian state and to spread ideas of radical social reform. ‘T'wo small nationalist risings in 1867 and 1868, encouraged by Ignatiev, were of little importance. Popular feeling in Bulgaria, moreover, was still anti-Greek at least as much as anti-Turkish. The destruction in 1767 of the Bulgarian Patriarchate of Ochrida had consolidated the Greek monopoly of the higher ranks of the Orthodox church in Bulgaria, a monopoly which was more and more bitterly resented. Even as early as the 1820s and 1830s the villages of Macedonia, with a population for the most part closely akin to the Bulgarians, had shown themselves violently hostile to their Greek bishops. ‘The decades which followed saw growing pressure in Bulgaria for a Bulgarian or at least Slav hierarchy, a demand which gained some sympathy at the Porte. The desire for Bulgarian religious autonomy, which in the 1860s took the form of a demand for a Bulgarian exarchate free from Greek control,
1JIn 1856-76 about 500 Bulgarians were educated in Russia (B. H. Sumner, Russia and the Balkans, 1870-1880 (Oxford, 1937), p- 112). By comparison the American-founded Robert College in Constantinople, by far the most important western educational establishment accessible to Bulgarians, had by 1878 taught only 45. (C. E. Black, ‘The Influence of Western Political Thought in Bulgaria, 1850-1885”, American Historical Review, xlviii (1942-3), p- 508). 2 —. Haumant, ‘Les origines de la lutte pour la Macédoine (1855-1872)’, Le Monde Slave, October 1926, p. 57. As late as 1872 Midhat Pasha, the Turkish reforming statesman, unsuccessfully proposed the reorganisation of the Ottoman Empire as a federation which would include Serbia and Rumania rather in the way that the newly-created German Empire included, say, Bavaria and Wirttemberg. 163


1860-70 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
also aroused support in Russia. Yet a bitter conflict between Greeks
and Bulgarians and the weakening of Orthodoxy in the Balkans
which would follow could not be welcome to the Russian govern
ment. It wished to create a Bulgarian exarchate, but only by agree
ment with the Greeks, and was hostile to the extremists on both
sides. The firman of 13 March 1870 by which the Porte established the
exarchate thus went a good deal further than Gorchakov or Ignatiev
wanted and was not a complete victory for Russian policy. By it no fewer than fourteen dioceses were included in the new exarchate and, a provision especially ominous to the Greeks, it was to be extended to cover any others in which two-thirds of the inhabitants were Bulgarian. The result of the Porte’s action, probably a calculated result, was to intensify greatly the existing bitterness between Greeks and Bulgars. The feeling of outrage shared by the Greeks could not recover the lost dioceses; but in 1872 the Patriarch in Constantinople gave expression to it by declaring the autonomous Bulgarian church to be schismatic. In contrast to the Greeks the Serbs showed themselves favourable to Bulgarian national claims in the 1860s. This was because Michael Obrenovich, the most remarkable ruler of nineteenth-century Serbia, hoped to use the Bulgarians to carry out his ambitious schemes for political reorganisation of the Balkans. During his short reign (1860-8) he accelerated the slow transformation of Serbia from a mediaeval principality into something like a modern state. The corrupt Senate lost much of its power and the elected Skupshchina, which had to meet at least once every three years, became the country’s main legislative body. The creation of a modern army based on conscription was begun — to the disquiet of the British and Austrian governments, which saw that it would probably be used before long against the Ottoman Empire. Above all Michael obtained the withdrawal of the garrisons which the Turks still maintained in the most important Serbian fortresses, notably Shabatz, Semendria and Belgrade itself. These garrisons had for many years been felt as a grievance by the Serbs and in 1861, soon after his accession to the throne, he tried unsuccessfully to have them removed. In June 1862 fighting between Turks and Serbs broke out in Belgrade and the Turkish garrison, from the security of the
citadel, bombarded the town, This gave Michael a chance to raise
the question once more; and early in September a conference of the
ambassadors of the powers in Constantinople, called on the initiative
of Austria, decided that the Turkish quarter of Belgrade must be
given up and the Turks henceforth confined to the fortress alone.
Elsewhere in Serbia the Turks were also to occupy only their

Austrian and to a lesser extent British opposition had prevented
Michael obtaining the complete Turkish evacuation which he had demanded, but he had achieved a considerable success.1 In the years which followed the Prince made considerable and eventually successful efforts to win over British opinion and the British government to acquiescence in his claims; and in September 1866, taking advantage of Austria’s defeat in Germany and preoccupation with Hungarian affairs, he asked for the cession to him of two of the less important fortresses still in Turkish hands. By the end of October Ristich, Michael’s agent in Constantinople, was negotiating for a general Turkish evacuation of all the fortresses. By December both Britain and Austria were advising the Turks to give way, Austria perhaps because she wished to avoid a new Balkan crisis and a possible partition of the Ottoman Empire until she had recovered from the effects of the disastrous struggle with Prussia. Russia, and more hesitantly France, took the same line. On 4 March 1867, therefore, the Porte at last agreed to withdraw its remaining garrisons. In return it demanded only that the Turkish flag be flown jointly with the Serbian one in Belgrade, a face-saving concession which Michael was quite willing to make. The most important aspect of Michael’s policies, however, was the series of schemes put forward throughout his reign for an antiTurkish alliance of the Balkan peoples, schemes which were the work of his Prime Minister, Garashanin, at least as much as of the Prince himself. Similar ideas were circulating elsewhere in the Balkans. The Greek government in 1860 made advances in Belgrade for some form of co-operation against the Turks; and the idea of a Greek-Serb—Montenegrin entente in which the Danubian principalities might be included gained some support in Athens. For several years little came of these schemes, mainly because all the Balkan governments were so weak and insecure. However a SerboMontenegrin treaty, which provided for the eventual unity of the two Principalities under Prince Michael, was signed in September 1866;2and in May 1867 a group of Bulgarian revolutionaries concluded with the Prince an agreement for a Serb—Bulgarian union to be formed after a successful war against the Porte. More important, the Greco-Serb treaty of 26 August 1867 provided for the eventual

and the Porte during the second half of 1866 and throughout 1867.

annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Serbs and of Epirus and Thessaly by Greece. It was consolidated by a military convention signed in February 1868: in January of the same year Michael had signed an alliance with Prince Charles of Rumania. By then there had come into existence a Balkan coalition against the Turks which in many ways foreshadows that of 1912 and which seemed to realise in some degree the schemes of Balkan unity and federation which had attracted idealists two generations earlier. Like the Balkan League of 1912 it owed a good deal to Russian influences, above all to that of Ignatiev who, on his own initiative, had worked hard to bring Greece and Serbia together and to stimulate a general war of the Balkan Christians against the Turks. It is very doubtful whether this anti-Turkish alliance could have defeated the Ottoman Empire. All the Balkan states were weak. None had a strong army and all would have had the greatest difficulty in financing a war of any duration. There was still no general revolutionary feeling in Bulgaria; raids into Bulgarian territory in May—June 1867 by armed bands from Rumania and Serbia met with little support from the inhabitants. Moreover by 1868 the most favourable moment for an anti-Turkish war had gone. Of all the powers Austria was the one most anxious to preserve Turkish rule in the Balkans and the one best placed to put pressure on Serbia, the heart of the anti-Turkish alliance. During the Austro—Prussian war of 1866 and its immediate aftermath she could hardly have intervened effectively if the Balkan principalities had attacked Turkey. By 1868, after buying off the opposition of her Hungarian subjects by the Ausgleich of 1867, she was once more in a position to do so. The Habsburg government, with French support, protested in Belgrade against the obvious preparations there for a war against Turkey and seems to have promised Michael the peaceful acquisition of Bosnia if he gave up his aggressive plans. Moreover Russian support for the anti-Turkish alliance was limited and halfhearted. Milyutin, the Russian War Minister, sent Russian officers to train the Serbian army in 1867-8; but it was clear that Gorchakov was unwilling to involve Russia in a Serbo—Turkish war. By the end of 1867, therefore, Russian influence in Belgrade was definitely declining. Also no Russian statesman wished to strengthen Rumania and thus make more difficult the recovery of southern Bessarabia which, though of little intrinsic value, was desired for reasons of prestige. The military capacities of the anti-Turkish alliance were never put to the test. On ro June 1868 Prince Michael was murdered and the 1 See pp. 291-2. OSES os Ril

CRIMEAN WAR—BOSNIAN REVOLT 1868-73
coalition he had constructed at once fell to pieces. There was a rapid growth of Serb—Montenegrin rivalry, stimulated by the desire of Prince Nicholas of Montenegro to become ruler of Serbia. Milan, the son and successor of Michael, was a child; and until 1871 the regency which ruled on his behalf was dominated by Austrian influences. No anti-Turkish line could be expected from it. Greece, exhausted and discouraged by her unsuccessful efforts to secure Crete, became more and more anti-Slav after the creation of the Bulgarian exarchate in 1870. Above all the rivalries of Greeks, Serbs and Bulgars in Macedonia, later to be of such disastrous importance,! were already present in embryo. Serbian demands for northern Macedonia had already complicated the negotiation of the treaty of August 1867 with Greece; and though Prince Michael was willing to recognise most of Macedonia as Bulgarian territory his successors were not. By 1873 a Serbian map showed the area allegedly populated by Serbs as extending not merely across Macedonia but as far as the Black Sea port of Burgas, a claim which was the negation of Bulgarian nationality. The plans of Michael Obrenovich had failed. Balkan nationalism was henceforth to mean the crystallisation of a number of jealously independent states and not, as had hitherto seemed possible, the emergence of some kind of Balkan federation. From the Porte’s point of view this was all to the good. Christian divisions were one of the main props of its slowly-declining power. But it was now clear that the Turks themselves were not immune from the nationalist virus. For a generation reform of the Ottoman Empire had meant, in the main, concessions to its Christian subjects, efforts to meet their demands and those of their European protectors and to give them equality with their Turkish or Turkified rulers. This process was carried an important stage further with the creation in 1868 of a Council of State, nearly a third of whose members were nonMuslims, and with the issue in 1869 of a new nationality law which placed Turkish citizenship on a territorial basis and divorced it from all connection with religion.” The desire for reform of statesmen such as Reschid Pasha, Ali Pasha or Fuad Pasha was sincere as far as it went; but in the nature of things the type of change for which they stood, and the creation of a secular Ottoman nationality (Osmanlilik), could not save the empire. There were two reasons for this. The first, fairly obvious by 1870, was that equality, even if it could be attained

167


1859-67 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 in practice, which was still far from certain, would not content its Christian subjects. What they now increasingly demanded was unity with their co-nationals outside the empire, as in the case of the Cretans; or at least autonomy, as in that of the Bulgars. They wished to escape from Ottoman rule, not to assist in preserving it. The second factor which hampered reform, though one which was still far less obvious, was the resentment which it aroused among the Turkish population. To many Turks it seemed something forced on the empire in response to the alleged wishes of its Christian subjects, a symbol of its weakness and humiliation at the hands of the European powers, something in whose doubtful benefits the great majority of Turks did not share and were not meant to share.t Abuse of the capitulatory system, which became increasingly flagrant after the Crimean War, helped to intensify this feeling. The fruit of reform, it appeared, had not been greater national strength or prestige but merely the creation of an expensive and superficially Europeanised oligarchy of high officials which now governed the country. The resentment aroused among a small group of educated Turks by this position was now reaching a dangerous pitch. It was fed on the one hand by Islamic tradition, the tradition which Reschid, Ali and Fuad seemed to have flouted, and by the anger with which the ulema and many army officers saw themselves increasingly pushed into the background by the new and largely hereditary class of powerful bureaucrats.? On the other hand it was strengthened, incongruously enough, by western ideas of government and education, notably by the example of the Italian liberal and national movement which helped to give it a conspiratorial character. This discontent assumed practical form in the 1860s with the growth of the loosely-organised Young Ottoman movement. But as yet it could achieve nothing. The mysterious Kuleli conspiracy of September 1859 in Constantinople, which seems to have been a protest against the grant of new privileges to the Christians, was a failure. The Patriotic Alliance, which the Young Ottomans formed in the summer of 1865 and which was apparently a revolutionary organisation, was soon broken up. By 1867 most of its leaders Namik Kemal, Ali Suavi and the Egyptian prince, Mustapha Fazil Pasha — were refugees in Paris. They were soon divided by bitter

disputes and by 1871, when the Grand Vizier Mahmud Nedim Pasha offered them an amnesty, nearly all of them had returned home. They were by no means a completely spent force, however. Even in their failure they had shown the emergence in the Ottoman Empire of a potentially dangerous form of Turkish nationalism. The administrative confusion and economic suffering of the period 1871-5 (there were serious famines in 1873-4, notably in Anatolia) meant that the outbreak of revolt in Herzegovina in the summer of 18751 found many Turks willing to welcome a change of regime. Of all the nationalist and pseudo-nationalist movements which affected the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire in the 1860s the most impressive to observers in western Europe was Panslavism. An interest in the other Slav peoples of Europe, in their history, languages, customs and political future, had long been developing in Russia. The first university chair of Slavonic Studies had been created there in 1811; and reflections of this interest become increasingly common in Russian literature during the first half of the nineteenth century. The Slavophils of the 1830s and 1840s (Khomyakov, Samarin, the Aksakov brothers) who were the forerunners of the more politically-minded Panslavs of the 1860s and 1870s, tended to think of religion as the unifying principle which bound together the Slav peoples of Europe. To them it was Orthodoxy rather than race, language or political interests which linked Russia with the rest of the Slav world.? Stress on the cultural and linguistic union of the Slav peoples was until after the middle of the century stronger among non-Russian Slav intellectuals, such as the Czech Dobrovsky and the Slovaks Kollar and Safarik, than among any corresponding group in Russia. The word ‘Panslavism’ was first used, significantly enough, not in Russia but in a work on linguistics published in 1826 by the Slovak scholar Jan Herkel. But even in the first half of the century there were signs that Slav solidarity was beginning to be envisaged as a very important source of Russian political power. In particular Professor M. P. Pogodin, the author during his long life of a vast quantity of Panslav writing, struck this note repeatedly from the 1830s onwards in his proposals for a great federation of Slav peoples (which would include Greece, Hungary and the Danubian principalities) to be formed under Russian leadership. In 1838, for example, he assured the

Tsarevich Alexander that the Slavs of the Balkans desired ‘nothing
so much as to become subjects of the White Tsar’, and that as a result ‘Tsar Nicholas is nearer to Charles V’s and Napoleon’s dream of the World State than those two ever got’.! In the same year the ‘Tllyrian’ leader Lyudevit Gaj urged Nicholas I to master the Balkans by playing upon the Russophil sympathies of the Croats. After the Crimean War the political and racial basis of Panslavism was much more heavily emphasised than in the past, while its religious aspects became less important. The hatred of Austria inspired in Russia by the war made it henceforth an anti-German almost as much as an anti-Turkish movement. Its leading figure was now I. S. Aksakov, one of the greatest journalists in Russian history, who became editor of the newspaper Den’ (The Day) in 1861. His insistence that in the Balkans Russia must oppose the Orthodox Greeks as well as the Turks and stifle any pan-Hellenic movement is a good illustration of the extent to which national feelings had now triumphed over religious ones. Not until the end of the 1850s did Panslav feeling begin to take an effective institutional form. In 1858 the Moscow Slavic Benevolent Committee was set up to carry on Panslav propaganda and welfare activities. It was not a very large body (it had 326 members at the end of its first year) but it enjoyed a good deal of backing at the highest social level. Both the Empress and the Heir Apparent (later Alexander III) contributed to its funds; while it submitted regular reports on its activities to the Asiatic Section of the Foreign Ministry, which controlled Russia’s relations with the Balkans. Similar committees were set up in St. Petersburg (1868), Kiev (1869) and Odessa (1870). Above all the congresses of delegates from almost all parts of the Slav world which were held in Moscow in 1867 and Prague in 1868 did much to stimulate the idea of Slav political unity, at least in Russia, though neither had any practical result or was fully representative.” By the later 1860s Panslav ideas were beginning to have some importance in the world of Russian officialdom. In particular Ignatiev, from the Russian legation in Constantinople, constantly urged a forward policy in the Near East — recovery of southern Bessarabia; nullification of the Black Sea clauses of the treaty of Paris; control of Constantinople either by establishing Russian diplomatic preponderance there or by outright conquest

which was to be achieved partly by the influence of Panslav propa
ganda among the Austrian and Turkish Slavs. In January 1867 he
urged unsuccessfully that Russia should guard against possible
western intervention in the Cretan crisis by concentrating a large force on her Galician frontier for use against Austria and by preparing an expeditionary force of 30,000 men for a descent on the Bosphorus. But the practical importance of Panslavism in this period was still very small. Such significance as it had it drew from the support given it by a large part of the Russian educated classes and by some members of the highest ranks of society. To call it a popular movement would be a great exaggeration; but it was a spontaneous and non-official one. As such it made little appeal to the Russian bureaucracy, traditionally suspicious of any initiative from below in life or society. Moreover such dynamism as it possessed stemmed not from the elements of Slav solidarity, even of altruism, which it undoubtedly contained, but from its position as a vehicle for Russian nationalism. And to a cosmopolitan aristocrat speaking and writing French in preference to Russian, such as Gorchakoy, or to the Baltic Germans who still counted for so much in the upper ranks of the Russian army and administration, a pseudo-intellectual nationalist movement of this kind, with its centre in Moscow and emphatically not in St. Petersburg, was unsympathetic.1 The constant difficulties which Panslavy newspapers (Den’, Moskvich, Parus, Moskva) had to face in their dealings with the government and the censorship during the 1860s is a good illustration of this point. Moreover there was never any agreed or organised Panslav political programme. Pogodin in his innumerable books and articles, General R. A. Fadeev in his Opinion on the Eastern Question (1869), N. Y. Danilevskii in his Russia and Europe (1871) — the most famous and most unreadable of Panslav writing—sall put forward schemes for some sort of Russian-dominated Slav federation in the Balkans. Often these federations were to include also great areas of central Europe and non-Slav peoples such as the Greeks, Magyars and Rumanians. Almost always Constantinople was to be their capital. But these were dreams, not blue-prints. On how such a federation was to be created, on how its component parts should be related to each other, on whether Constantinople should be annexed by Russia or should be a free city, there was no agreement. Panslavism then was

vague, unorganised, with little influence at the highest levels in Russian government. By the early 1870s it had none the less emerged as a new and potentially important element in the Near Eastern situation. As the future was to show, it was capable of producing very powerful though short-lived spasms of public feeling in Russia and thus adding to the already formidable difficulties which the Russian government had to face in the Near East. The Franco-Prussian war of 1870-1 allowed Gorchakov, however, by purely diplomatic means and unaided by the Panslavs, to achieve what had for nearly fifteen years been the greatest political objective of Russia — the nullification of the Black Sea clauses of the treaty of Paris. Long before 1870 it had become clear that, if it were correctly timed and adroitly executed, such a nullification would not be opposed by some at least of the great powers. As long ago as 1859 both France and Austria had shown that in certain circumstances they would accept it, while in 1866 Bismarck had indicated that he was willing to support it. The battle of Sedan, on 2 September 1870, which clearly signalled the beginning of a new epoch in European history, gave Russia an opportunity not to be missed. A few days after it had been fought Gorchakov sounded Prince Reuss, the Prussian ambassador at St. Petersburg, and got from him a promise later confirmed by Bismarck and William I of Prussian support should Russia decide to denounce the humiliating clauses. On 27 October Alexander II told his ministers of his decision to do this. They unanimously approved; and on the gist, in a circular to Russian representatives abroad, Gorchakov announced that Russia would no longer consider herself bound by Articles XI—XIII of the treaty of Paris. He justified this decision by pointing out, quite correctly, that the treaty had been repeatedly violated in the Danubian principalities and by arguing, in effect, that it could not be expected that some of its provisions should remain intact while others were completely disregarded. The denunciation was symbolic, a sop to Russia’s desire to regain the prestige and international status which seemed to have been lost in 1856. It was not inspired by aggressive plans in the Near East and it became clear almost at once that Britain and Austria, the powers most likely to oppose it, would take no effective action. British press and public opinion were very hostile to Russia,! but the government, and above all the Prime Minister, Gladstone, were much more moderate in their attitude. What was objected to in London was not
? The final suppression of the independence of Circassia by the Russians in 1864, and above all the crushing of the Polish revolt of 1863-4, had done much to keep alive Russophobe feeling in Britain.

Its meetings began on 17 January 1871 and ended with an agreement in March that Russia should resume her sovereign rights in the Black Sea. As a formal counterweight to this concession the Porte was empowered to open the Straits in time of peace to the warships of friendly powers if it felt this was necessary to secure the execution of the treaty of Paris. The British government had succeeded in making the nullification of the Black Sea clauses of 1856, at least formally, the result of an international decision and not of the action of Russia alone. On the other hand the Russian circular of 31 October 1870 had not been withdrawn. It had rather been ‘neatly and effectively by-passed’.! Russia had won a diplomatic victory and Gorchakov’s prestige and reputation were at their height. But the victory was a rather empty one. It had been gained by beating at a
door which was already open, or at least half-open. For many years
to come poverty and lack of a consistent Near Eastern policy were to prevent Russia from rebuilding a Black Sea fleet of any consequence.

1858-75 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 By the early 1870s, then, it was clear that the respite given the Ottoman Empire by the Anglo-French victory in the Crimea had not been effectively used. The empire had failed adequately to reform and modernise itself. Such reform as had been undertaken had created almost as many problems as it solved. Nationalism was steadily growing in scope and intensity in the Balkans and behind it loomed the threat, apparently menacing though in fact largely unreal, of Panslavism. Moreover the direct material involvement, economic and strategic, of the European powers in Turkey was now beginning to increase at an unprecedented rate. Hitherto the interest of Russia in the Straits had been the only one of this kind which was of immediate and first-class importance to any of the great states. To the other powers the Ottoman Empire had been important as an essential element in the European balance; for this reason it must never be allowed to fall under the control of Russia and if it were partitioned the division must be along lines agreed beforehand. But this importance, though great, had been indirect, intangible, almost speculative. Some of the powers had been involved in certain parts of the empire for reasons of tradition and prestige, as France was in Syria and to a lesser extent in Egypt. Others had had strategic interests there, as Britain had in Egypt and Mesopotamia and Austria in Bosnia. But none of these had been truly essential to the power concerned. Now, by the 1870s, the position was changing. The direct economic stake in the Ottoman Empire held by many of the European states was growing. Turkish government loans had created, above all in Britain and France, considerable groups of rentiers with a direct personal interest in the existence and stability of the Ottoman Empire; and it was clear that the empire’s financial position was now very serious. The Turkish government was compelled, as a condition of its existence, to spend heavily on its armed forces. As one British ambassador pointed out, ‘Economy beyond a certain point is impossible in a great Empire, surrounded in Europe by military states and in Asia by warlike and nomadic tribes’.1 Heavy naval and military expenditure and an inelastic revenue meant heavy foreign borrowing and increasing difficulty in meeting the demands of foreign creditors. The years from 1858 onwards saw Turkey’s shaky finances threatened by an over-issue of paper money; and the Syrian troubles of 1860-1 produced a temporary collapse of Turkish credit. From 1865 onwards the proceeds of new loans were used almost entirely to pay the interest on existing ones. By the mid-1870s, as the result of repeated borrowing, 12 million Turkish pounds out of a total government revenue of 22 1 Bell, op. cit., p. 65.

million was being absorbed by interest payments on the national
debt. In Egypt foreign investment, aided by the great boom in
cotton-production there during the 1860s caused by the American Civil War and the cutting-off of Europe’s normal cotton supplies, grew even more rapidly than in the Ottoman Empire proper. In 1863-76 the Egyptian foreign debt rose from £3:3 million to £91 million; and the overwhelming majority of it was held in Europe. Nor were government loans the only means by which foreigners invested in the Ottoman Empire. Railway-building was now belatedly getting under way in some parts of the empire (the first Turkish railway, a short line between Smyrna and Aidin, was opened to traffic in 1866) and the tour of western Europe which the Sultan Abdul Aziz undertook in 1867 did much to popularise the idea of railways in Turkey. Grandiose schemes of large-scale construction were now attracting European adventurers and entrepreneurs.! European investment in port facilities, in banks, in utilities of all kinds, was slowly growing, helped by the fact that legislation of 1867 made it possible for the first time for Europeans to own real estate in the Ottoman Empire. It is significant of the changing position that Sir Henry Bulwer, British ambassador to the Porte in 1858-65, acted after his retirement from this post until his death in 1872 as an agent in the Levant for one of the companies which were now seeking concessions there, the Société des Travaux Publiques et Banque d’Orient. It is impossible to imagine Ponsonby or Stratford occupying such a position. Above all the opening of the Suez Canal in November 1869 meant that the Ottoman Empire now contained within its boundaries two of the greatest arteries of world trade; and the newer of the two very soon outstripped in importance the millenia-old waterway of the Straits. The 1840s, which saw the construction of a sea-level canal from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean emerge as a practical possibility, also saw the British government show itself bitterly hostile to the project. Such a canal, it was argued in London, would become a ‘second Bosphorus’ and create all sorts of international difficulties a forecast which events were to justify. It would also be impossibly difficult and expensive to construct (though the great French and Austrian engineers, Talabot and Negrelli, after surveys made in 1847, thought it quite practicable). Not until 1863 was the Foreign Office finally convinced that the canal could be built. Above all the

Turkish government from 1872 onwards to plan railway-construction in the
Ottoman Empire, proposed a great network of lines to unite it and develop its
resources.
175


1854-71 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 fact that the canal project was popular in France made it inevitably suspect in Britain, where it seemed likely to establish French influence in a dominant position on the most direct route to India. It might even lead to French colonisation of Egypt. Palmerston and his successors at the Foreign Office therefore strongly advocated instead the building of a railway across the isthmus; and such a railway was in fact completed in 1858. The accession to power in 1854 as Viceroy of Egypt of Said Pasha, the favourite son of Mohammed Ali, made French influence dominant there. In November of that year the former French diplomat Ferdinand de Lesseps obtained from him a 99-year concession for the building of a canal. Strong British opposition in both Constantinople and Cairo, aided by the hesitant attitude of Count Buol, meant that it was not until November 1858 that de Lesseps was able to float in Paris his Compagnie Universelle du Canal Maritime de Suez. When he did most of the shares subscribed for (only 222,000 of the total of 400,000 were taken up by the general public) were bought by Frenchmen. British hostility to the canal had now rallied French patriotism to its support; and work on it was begun formally in April 1859. In October of that year, just as British opposition at Constantinople appeared to be bringing the whole project to a standstill, Napoleon III, his hands freed by the end of his war with Austria in north Italy, at last decided to give it official support. This was decisive. De Lesseps had still many difficulties to encounter; but by 1863 if not earlier there was a growing realisation in London that the canal would be built in spite of all Britain could do to prevent it. There had always been a good deal of support for it in commercial circles; and Englishmen could console themselves with Gladstone’s sensible reminder that so long as she was supreme at sea Britain must, in some sense, control the canal. The last remnants of British opposition died away when, on 19 March 1866, the Porte at last gave formal approval to de Lesseps’s project. Its completion over three years later was the most spectacular achievement of the France of the Second Empire. During the first year or two of its life the canal was not a commercial success. In 1870-1 there were even suggestions that the British government might buy it from the Company. A few years more, however, showed that its construction had changed the pattern of world trade and begun a new epoch in the relations of Europe with India, the Far East and even Australasia. The strategic and commercial significance of the Near East to the states of western Europe, and above all to Britain, had now changed
176


CRIMEAN WAR—BOSNIAN REVOLT 1870s
fundamentally. From a convenient short-cut for travellers and despatches in transit to or from the East, as it had hitherto been, the Suez route had become the greatest single artery of world trade. The growing economic interests of the European powers in the Ottoman Empire, of which the Suez Canal was only the most spectacular example, were to influence their attitude to the Near East throughout the rest of the empire’s existence.

CHA PETARA Stan
The Eastern Crisis of
1875-8
Bosnia and Herzegovina, the mountainous, beautiful and backward provinces which formed the north-western extremity of the Ottoman Empire in Europe, had suffered throughout the empire’s history from chronic lawlessness and misgovernment. Their Moslem landlords had for centuries enjoyed a degree of autonomy which often approached independence. Mahmud II, as part of his centralising policies, had struggled long and with some success to bring these local notables to heel. But though by the early 1850s they had been subjected more effectively than ever before to the administrative control of the Porte this did nothing to remove the greatest of all sources of discontent in the area — its antiquated social and economic structure. Its Moslem rulers dominated, often very harshly, a mainly Christian peasantry many of whose members were still serfs. Social divisions thus coincided with religious ones, splitting hopelessly a society which was ethnically and linguistically unified.t There was a serious revolt in Bosnia in 1861-2, while the existence of an autonomous Serbia was now having a powerful influence on the situation in the two provinces. Serb-backed theological colleges at Mostar and Banja-Luka acted as centres of South Slav and Panserb propaganda; and probably only the murder of Michael Obrenovich in 1868 averted a new Christian revolt. His death led to an immediate slackening in Serb activity in Bosnia and Herzegovina. But the misgovernment and economic difficulties which afflicted the whole Ottoman Empire in the early 1870s ensured that discontent there
1 The British ambassador at Constantinople thought the position in Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1875 ‘not unlike that of the landlords and tenants of Ireland’. (Sir H. G. Elliot, Some Revolutions and other Diplomatic Experiences (London, 1922). p. 214.) It was estimated in the same year that the average kmet (peasant bound toa landlord) paid 44% of his total income in dues and taxes to the landlord and the state. (P. F. Sugar, The Industrialization of Bosnia—Hercegovina, 1878-1918 (Seattle, 1963),p. 11.)

THE EASTERN CRISIS 1872-5
continued to grow. In July 1875 increasing taxation and intolerable agrarian conditions produced a revolt, essentially one of Christian peasants against their Moslem masters, which aroused immediate uneasiness in the capitals of the great powers and the immediate sympathies of most of the Slav world. This sympathy was particularly marked among the Slav neighbours of the areas of revolt. Nicholas of Montenegro covertly supported the rebels from the first. Milan of Serbia, western in outlook and deeply unpopular with his subjects, did not share his attitude; and even Ristich, the hitherto bellicose Serbian Prime Minister, did not wish for war with the Turks when the danger of it became imminent. Moreover Alexander II warned the Serbian government against military intervention on behalf of the rebels. But insistent popular clamour and the attitude of the Skupshchina forced Milan to act. His throne, perhaps even his life, seemed in danger if he gave the Bosnians and Herzegovinians no help. By October frequent clashes were occurring between the Serbian army and the Turkish forces which were being assembled just across the frontier to suppress the revolt. But it was above all the response which the rebellion aroused in Russia, and the divergencies between her and the other great powers in the Near East which soon became apparent as a result, which raised a peasant jacquerie to international importance. Three years earlier Alexander II, William I of Germany and Francis Joseph of Austria-Hungary, had met briefly in Berlin in September 1872 in a demonstration of the unity of the conservative powers of Europe against the apparently threatening forces of revolution. Early in May 1873, during a visit of William I to St. Petersburg, a Russo-—German military convention was signed providing for each power to help the other with 200,000 men in case of attack by some third state. A month later the Tsar and Francis Joseph agreed to consult together if any dispute seemed likely to divide them. This series of interviews and agreements, limited and unsubstantial as it was,! constituted the so-called First Dreikaiserbund (League of the Three Emperors). It was undermined from the first by the mutual hostility and distrust of Russia and Austria, Count Julius Andrassy, the Foreign Minister of the Habsburg Empire, was a great Magyar aristocrat who had played an important role in the Hungarian revolution of 1848-9 and shared the anti-Russian outlook of his class. His desire for close relations with Britain, Russia’s most

dangerous enemy —in December 1871 he had made tentative
advances for a British alliance — was itself enough to mark him as
unreliable from the Russian point of view. In St. Petersburg, more
over, the anti-Austrian tradition built up over the last two decades
was still powerful. Above all Austria and Russia were divided by
differing attitudes to the Balkans. The Russian government did not
wish to destroy the Ottoman Empire; but for a good many years
Russian policy had envisaged the creation in its Balkan provinces of
a series of autonomous states under Christian rulers somewhat on the lines of Rumania and Serbia. If this were achieved the empire would be reduced, at least in Europe, to a mere ghost of its former self. Panslav influences, moreover, were very hostile to any growth of Austrian influence or territory in the Balkans. In Vienna by comparison the preservation of the Ottoman Empire as it stood was seen as a major Habsburg interest. ‘Turkey’, said Andrassy in a ministerial conference of 29 January 1875, ‘is almost of a providential utility to Austria. Her existence is essential to our well-understood interests. She keeps the status quo of the small states and hinders their aspirations to our advantage. Were there no Turkey, then all these heavy duties would fall on us.’! More specifically, it had for long been urged in Austrian military circles that the Monarchy should take any suitable opportunity of occupying Bosnia and Herzegovina. This idea was unpopular with most of the Emperor’s civilian ministers. In particular it was opposed by most of the Hungarian leaders. Since the constitutional changes of 1867, which made Hungary dominant in the eastern half of the Habsburg Empire, they had been struggling to rule and Magyarise most of its existing Slav population; they were unwilling to complicate this task by allowing the Habsburgs to acquire still more Slav subjects. But Francis Joseph, on the lookout for territorial gains which might offset the effect of the defeats of 1859 and 1866, was sympathetic to the military point of view. The conference of 29 January decided that a rising in Bosnia and Herzegovina should be used as a pretext for their occupation by Austrian troops. A few months later, when the revolt in fact occurred, Andrassy opposed military pressure for their immediate seizure; but in a circular of 16 October, he urged force
fully that autonomy of the two provinces under Turkish suzerainty,

THE EASTERN CRISIS 1864-75
as proposed by Russia, would be quite unworkable because of their
deep religious divisions. Moreover the grant of autonomy to them
would lead to demands for a similar concession to Bulgaria and would stimulate aggression against Turkey by Greece, Serbia and Montenegro. Austria and Russia were thus divided by radically differing attitudes to Bosnia and Herzegovina and more fundamentally to the Ottoman Empire and the whole structure of European politics. Throughout the crisis of 1875-8 Russia was weakened not merely by the opposition of Austria and Britain and by the failure of any important power to support her, but also by the divisions and incoherence of her own policy. The conflicting forces which produced this position were typified by Ignatiev and Gorchakov. The struggle between them was to be one of the most important elements in the situation. Ignatiev, brilliant, energetic, headstrong and none too scrupulous in his methods, was one of the few important Russian diplomats to be strongly influenced by Panslav ideas. Since his arrival in Constantinople in 1864 he had established a remarkable personal influence at the Porte. He had little experience of European politics! and aimed always at an independent Russian policy in the Near East leading to the eventual disruption of the Ottoman Empire. By the early 1870s he was hoping that the empire would soon collapse as the result of a great revolt of the Balkan Slavs against Turkish rule, a revolt which might be supported by the Arab subjects of the Sultan under Egyptian leadership.? International action in the Near East or the acceptance by Russia of international obligations there were always unwelcome to him. His dislike of Austria almost equalled that he felt for Britain and he strongly opposed the ineffective Austro—Russian rapprochement of 1872-3. By contrast Gorchakov, now nearing eighty, was cautious in aims, limited in outlook, above all a European and a professional diplomat. To him the Eastern Question was an integral part of European diplomacy, a matter for international discussion and regulation by conference. The radical and independent policy advocated by Ignatiev was repugnant to his feelings as well as to his sense of realities. His cautious attitude to Balkan complications was supported
1Before his appointment to Constantinople he had been military attaché in London and a brilliantly successful minister to China, with whom he concluded
the treaty of Pekin in November 1860. He was then head of the Asiatic Department of the Foreign Ministry for three years in 1861-4. 2 A draft treaty promising such support was initialled at the end of 1870 by de Lex, the Russian Consul in Cairo, and the Khedive Ismail. In 1875 there were
proposals that the Egyptian army be placed under a Russian commander. (F. J.
Cox, ‘Khedive Ismail and Panslavism’, Slavonic and East European Review, xxxii (1953-4), PP- 151-67.)

1875-6 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 by Baron Reutern, the Minister of Finance, by Milyutin, the War
Minister, and by Count P. A. Shuvalov and E. P. Novikov, the
Russian ambassadors in London and Vienna. Shuvalov in particular,
later supported by Milyutin, argued that Russia’s energies should be
concentrated on the Straits and not wasted in support of the bar
barous and ungrateful Slavs. Ignatiev on the other hand could rely
on support from the Panslavs and from certain military groups.
It very soon became apparent that the ambassador in Constanti
nople meant to pursue a policy of his own in dealing with the revolt
in Bosnia and Herzegovina. By the autumn of 1875, after the failure
of efforts from the end of July onwards to bring peace to the troubled
provinces by the joint consular action of the powers, he had persuaded the Sultan to attempt a settlement by personal negotiations with Alexander II — negotiations which were, of course, to be carried on through Ignatiev himself. Such a proposal was quite irreconcilable with Gorchakov’s desire to co-operate with Austria. The Tsar, in spite of a visit by Ignatiev to Livadia in the Crimea, where Alexander was then staying, refused to accept it. But the rapid growth in Russia of popular sympathy for the rebels was continually strengthening the ambassador’s hand and making his urgings more difficult to resist. The first serious attempt by the great powers to restore peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina took the form of the Andrassy Note, which was drawn up by the Austrian Foreign Minister and the Russian ambassador in Vienna and circulated to the capitals of Europe on 30 December 1875. This proposed that the Porte grant the two rebellious provinces religious liberty, that tax-farming there be abolished and that the Turkish government help the peasants of the area to buy land from their lords and thus reduce the acute agrarian discontent which had produced the revolt. The Sultan was to assure the powers formally of his intention to carry out these reforms and a mixed commission of Moslems and Christians was to be set up to supervise their enforcement. The Porte was also to communicate formally to the powers two decrees which it had issued on 2 October and 12 December (the latter was mainly the work of Ignatiev) and
which promised reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina. These proposals
were accepted by the other great powers, though the British govern
ment agreed to them only hesitantly and refused to demand their
acceptance in writing by the Porte. They were reluctantly agreed to
by the Turkish government, with some minor modifications, on
13 February 1876. A few days later they were proclaimed in Bosnia
and Herzegovina. But this was pure window-dressing. The Porte
was too weak, above all financially, to enforce them in the rebellious
182


THE EASTERN CRISIS 1876
provinces against the opposition of many of its own officials there. The Christians of Bosnia and Herzegovina distrusted, with good reason, both its power and its will to do anything effective for them. The rebels, in spite of considerable pressure from Austria, refused to stop fighting: a short-lived armistice early in April had no practical result. Andrassy’s effort to smooth over the situation with the minimum of upheaval, and in particular to avoid any Russian intervention, had failed. The early months of 1876 saw a notable growth of Russian sympathy for the rebels, while Ignatiey was now more and more dominated by Panslav emotions. Montenegro, for which Russian popular support was very strong, was from January onwards giving increasingly open help to the Bosnians and Herzegovinians. In April the war party gained the upper hand in Belgrade. The danger of Austro—Russian conflict in the Balkans was clear. In May Gorchakovy and Andrassy met in Berlin in an effort to avert it. From this meeting emerged the Berlin Memorandum of 13 May, which was almost entirely the work of Andrassy. This proposed a two-month armistice, a cooling-off period to be followed by negotiations between the Porte and its rebellious subjects. A programme of reform for Bosnia and Herzegovina more limited than that specified in the Andrassy Note was laid down; its execution was to be supervised by the consuls of the powers in the area. But the Memorandum was more than just another reform proposal. During the discussions which produced it it had been agreed that if the Ottoman Empire collapsed Austria was to take part of Bosnia and Russia to recover southern Bessarabia. Moreover it contained an implied threat, inserted on the initiative of Gorchakov, of action by the powers if the armistice failed to produce a settlement. This broad hint that the Porte would if necessary be coerced into making concessions to the rebels helped to ensure the rejection of the Memorandum by the British government, in spite of its immediate acceptance by France and Italy. Benjamin Disraeli, Prime Minister since the Conservative electoral victory of February 1874, complained that the Dreikaiserbund powers were ‘asking us to sanction them in their putting the knife to the throat of Turkey, whether we like it or not’. Also there was strong feeling in the cabinet that it was almost insulting for Britain to be asked merely to assent, at short notice, to a scheme drawn up by other states. The British attitude greatly reduced any chance of the memorandum being accepted by the Sultan. What made it a dead letter, however, was the political chaos which now reigned in Constantinople.

1876 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 The extravagance, incompetence and megalomania of Abdul Aziz,! coupled with the famine of 1873-4, had brought discontent in the Turkish capital to a high pitch even before the outbreak of the revolt in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The new rebellion which erupted in Bulgaria at the end of April 1876 and which involved the slaughter of a considerable number of Turks by the rebels raised it to the level of revolution. The Bulgarian revolt had been prepared by groups of émigré revolutionaries in Giurgevo and Bucharest with some support from Serbia. But the discovery of the preparations by the Turkish authorities forced its leaders to act sooner than they had intended and the movement was a failure. The ferocity with which it was suppressed — about 60 villages were destroyed and 12-—15,000 people massa—cprrodeucded a violent anti-Turkish reaction in Britain. There the generally Turcophil policies which had been followed in the Near East for the past forty years helped to produce a sense of guilt and complicity quite unparalleled elsewhere in Europe. From July 1876 until the end of the year a great popular agitation which drew heavily on the religious emotionalism still so widespread in Britain developed against the Ottoman Empire. Gladstone’s The Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East, published in September, sold 200,000 copies within a month and did more than any other publication of the century to destroy pro-Turkish feeling in Britain.” The agitation was equally directed against the Conservative government which was the supporter of the Ottoman Empire and therefore, it was alleged, in effect its accomplice in the massacres. Throughout the second half of 1876 public emotion made it virtually impossible for Disraeli and his colleagues to interfere in a RussoTurkish war should one break out. Events in Bulgaria also brought to fever-pitch the anti-Turkish feeling which had been growing for the last year in Serbia. Pressure in favour of peace by Andrassy and to a lesser extent by Gorchakov had no effect in Belgrade. On 30 June Prince Milan, urged on by Kartsov, the Russian consul in Belgrade who was a Panslav and under the influence of Ignatiev, and fearing revolution or assassination if he did not act, declared war on Turkey. Fighting began on
1“What good is this empire,’ he is said to have remarked in February 1876, ‘when I cannot have the gold I need?’ (D. Harris, A Diplomatic History of the Balkan Crisis of1875-1878: The First Year (Stanford, 1936), p. 236.) * Though as R. T. Shannon, Gladstone and the Bulgarian Agitation, 1876 (London, 1963) has recently emphasised (see especially chap. III passim) Gladstone entered the agitation late and did more than anyone to restrict its growth. He wanted no fundamental change in Britain’s Near Eastern polic—ythe pamphlet adheres unobtrusively to the idea of Turkish territorial integrity — and was interested in the movement in England rather than in the atrocities themselves.

THE EASTERN CRISIS 1876
2 July. On the roth Serbia and Montenegro signed a treaty of alliance and a military convention. The first result in Constantinople of these events was the fall from power of Mahmud Nedium Pasha, the Grand Vizier, who was known to be much under the influence of Ignatiev. On 11 May he was driven from office, together with the Sheikh-ul-Islam, by a demonstration of armed softas (theological students). The antiforeign and to a lesser extent Panislamic feelings which had been gaining ground among the Turks during the last two decades were now stronger than ever. On 30 May Abdul Aziz was deposed by a conspiracy led by Husein Avni Pasha, the War Minister, and Midhat Pasha. Five days later he committed suicide. His successor, Murad V, was mentally unbalanced and deeply shocked by his predecessor’s fate. He was never able to play any active part in government; and on 15 June an army officer with a private grievance murdered both Husein Avni Pasha and the Foreign Minister, Rashid Pasha. Finally on 31 August, with the cautious encouragement of the British ambassador, Murad was deposed without bloodshed by his ministers. His half-brother Abdul Hamid II, who had already promised to introduce a constitution and act only on the counsel of responsible advisers, succeeded him; and on 2 and 12 October, in an effort to reduce the danger of foreign intervention, notes were sent to the powers promising that a constitution would be promulgated and a parliament elected. Not since the upheaval of 1807 had the central government of the empire been in such confusion as during this ‘Year of three Sultans’. The result was that by June the Berlin Memorandum had been, in effect, abandoned by the powers which had drawn it up. The fact that Serbia and Montenegro were now at war with Turkey forced Austria and Russia, early in July 1876, to come to a more specific agreement than any they had hitherto made regarding their respective ambitions in the Balkans. On 8 July, at Reichstadt in Bohemia, Gorchakov and Andrassy agreed verbally not to intervene in the war for the time being but to reach a subsequent understanding on this point if it seemed necessary. If Turkey defeated the Serbs and Montenegrins she would not be allowed to benefit from her victory, for Austria and Russia would demand that Serbia be restored to her pre-war position and might demand the recognition of Montenegro as an independent state. Moreover even if the Porte were victorious Bosnia and Herzegovina would be reorganised on the basis of autonomy (according to the version of the agreement sent by Gorchakov to the Tsar) or on that proposed in the Andrassy Note and Berlin Memorandum (according to
185


1876 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 Andrassy’s version). If the Turks were defeated Russia would
recover southern Bessarabia, while Austria would not oppose her acquisition of Batum and other gains on her Asiatic frontier with Turkey. The Austrian version of the agreement provided that if Serbia made gains in Old Serbia, on her southern frontier, and in the Sanjak of Novibazar, the mountainous area between Serbia and Montenegro, the Habsburg Monarchy should take most of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Russian version envisaged Serb gains in Old Serbia and Bosnia, the acquisition of part of Herzegovina by Montenegro and the annexation by the Habsburgs merely of Turkish Croatia and some parts of Bosnia near the Austrian frontiers. It was common ground that if the Ottoman Empire in Europe collapsed completely Constantinople might become a free city, Epirus and Thessaly be annexed by Greece, and Bulgaria and Rumelia become autonomous or even independent states. Historians have devoted a good deal of attention to the discrepancies between the Austrian and Russian versions of the agreement.! These discrepancies illustrate the obvious defects of verbal understandings between statesmen, especially when one of the statesmen is as old and as geographically ill-informed as Gorchakov. But they are less important than the fact that the agreement was made at all. Its conclusion showed that in both Vienna and St. Petersburg the Dreikaiserbund, even the feeble and loosely-articulated Drezkaiserbund of 1872-3, still had some meaning. Neither government wished to take violent action in the Balkans. In particular the Russian government was still able to continue the policy of co-operation with the powers, above all with Austria, which it had consistently pursued for the past year, and to resist Panslav demands for an independent and adventurous policy in the Near East. Nevertheless there were plenty of signs of the disquieting strength which Panslav feeling was now assuming in Russia. General Cherniaev, a leading Panslav known for his exploits in the Russian conquest of central Asia, had arrived in Serbia in May to take command of its army;? and the expectation of Russian help had encouraged the Serbian declaration of war on the Porte. Prayers for Serbian victory were offered in Russian churches while the flow of money to Serbia from Russian sympathisers accelerated. By

THE EASTERN CRISIS 1876 November roughly three million roubles had been raised in Russia for the Serb and Montenegrin cause, not counting gifts in kind. Russian volunteers joined the Serb army, though their numbers have often been exaggerated! and their relations with their Serb ‘brothers’ were often poor. ‘All that has happened in Russia this summer’, wrote Aksakov in December, ‘is an unheard-of phenomenon in the history of any country: public opinion conducted a war apart from the government and without any state organisation in a foreign state.” Russian sympathy, however heartfelt and widespread, was of limited practical use to the Serbs. Their army of 130,000 men, without reserves, was too small for the task confronting it. They were desperately short of money; and the successes won by Montenegro did little to reduce Turkish pressure on Serbia. By mid-August the Serbian government was willing to accept an armistice. On 15 September, the Porte agreed to one; but it lasted for only a few days, and by the end of October the Turks were in a position to advance on Belgrade. Only a Russian ultimatum demanding that hostilities end within forty-eight hours and an armistice be signed to last for 6-8 weeks prevented their doing so. The Serbian collapse had two important results as far as Russia was concerned. Firstly the Panslavs, irritated and disillusioned by Serb weakness, began to think increasingly of Bulgaria rather than Serbia as the main prop of future Russian influence in the Balkans. An autonomous Bulgarian state might well prove a more effective weapon against the Turks than discredited Serbia; and the Bulgars, more than any Balkan people except the Montenegrins, were led by confirmed Russophils and immune to west-European influences. Increasingly the idea of a big Bulgaria, to be created to some extent at the expense of Serbian territorial ambitions, gained ground. In the second place the Serbian collapse seemed to bring nearer the moment when Russia would have to intervene militarily to protect against the Turks not merely the Bosnians and Herzegovinians but all the Slav inhabitants of the Balkans. Her prestige and hopes of future influence in the peninsula seemed to depend upon some action of this sort. The stability of the Russian monarchy, already threatened by the populist movement of the early 1870s, would be further undermined if Panslav emotions were ignored or rebuffed. ‘War or disorder at home,’ wrote a high-ranking Foreign Ministry official on 21 August, ‘that is the dilemma.’? Yet Russian intervention would

certainly mean friction, perhaps war, with Austria-Hungary. It therefore became essential to clarify the attitude Germany was likely to take to Russian military action and the struggle with Austria to which it might lead. Bismarck’s reaction to events in the Near East was dominated by a profound unwillingness to see Russia and Austria in serious conflict. Such a conflict, if it came to war, would be extremely dangerous to Germany’s position in Europe. Since she wished to be on good terms with both her Dretkaiserbund partners it would place her in a very difficult dilemma. It might allow France to escape, by alliance with one of the combatants, from the isolation and relative impotence which she had had to endure since 1871. Even if Austro—Russian tension remained purely political and diplomatic Germany could hardly avoid making some choice between them and thus antagonising one of them. To Bismarck it seemed clear that the obvious solution of this problem was a partition of the Ottoman Empire which would assuage Austro—Russian rivalry and give something to all the great powers with Near Eastern interests. The Habsburg Monarchy should take Bosnia and Herzegovina and dominate the western Balkans. Russia should control the eastern half of the peninsula by recovering southern Bessarabia and dominating Rumania and an autonomous Bulgaria. Britain should occupy Egypt and perhaps some of the Turkish islands in the Aegean, while France could be compensated in Syria. As the danger of active Austro—Russian antagonism in the Balkans grew the German Chancellor made an effort to strengthen his hand in dealing with it by winning the co-operation of Britain. In January and February 1876 he made tentative advances to the British government which culminated in the suggestion, in general terms that a partition of the Ottoman Empire might be necessary. These advances had no success. Lord Derby, the British Foreign Secretary, was incapable of taking any clear-cut decision. The cabinet was divided and uncertain in its attitude to the Near East. Shuvalov spoke of it at the end of April as being in a ‘state of inertia’ on Balkan questions; and its divisions and uncertainty became more marked as the year went on. Disraeli (from June 1876 Earl of Beaconsfield) had no liking for the Turks. But he was deeply anxious to avoid the destruction of the Ottoman Empire if possible, though at times he spoke as though its partition were inevitable. Since he feared united action against the Turks by the powers of the Drezkaiserbund he was willing to consider
1 He was also unwilling to see them in close co-operation, since this would deprive Germany of her position as an intermediary between them; but this was a much less pressing danger.
188


THE EASTERN CRISIS 1876 a separate agreement with one of them which would break the entente between them. In October he proposed to Queen Victoria an Anglo-German alliance to maintain the Near Eastern status quo; and if Bismarck’s advances early in the year had been more wholehearted agreement between Britain and Germany might have been reached. In November, moreover, Andrassy made a secret approach to the British government for an agreement to limit the effect of a Russian victory over the Turks should war break out. On the other hand in June, there were negotiations which came close to success for an Anglo—Russian agreement to give autonomy to Bosnia and Herzegovina; and in September Lord Salisbury, the Secretary of State for India, urged strongly the need for co-operation with Russia. Such unity as British policy possessed in 1876 lay in the end at which it aimed, the preservation of the Ottoman Empire, and not in the means to be used to reach that end. Neither in London nor in Berlin was the desire for Anglo-German co-operation strong enough to achieve any practical result. By the autumn the growth in Russia of feeling in favour of war with the Turks was making it more and more difficult for Bismarck to avoid the unpleasant choice between her and Austria. In September Field-Marshal von Manteuffel, who had been sent on a special mission to the Tsar then attending the manoeuvres of the Russian army in Poland, was told clearly by him that the Russians wanted German support in the Balkans and a promise of German neutrality in case of war with the Habsburg Empire. Pinned down in this unwelcome way, Bismarck struggled to avoid a direct answer. But the Kaiser insisted on one being given. On 23 October General von Schweinitz, who was returning to his post as German ambassador in St. Petersburg, was told that Germany would do her best to prevent the outbreak of any Austro—Russian conflict and would remain neutral if one took place. If there were intervention by other powers, however, she might be forced to abandon this neutrality. She did not wish to see the power of Russia reduced; but she could not allow the power or independence of the Habsburg Empire to be endangered, for this would threaten the entire European balance. The instructions ended with a promise of German good offices to keep Austria and Britain neutral if Russia went to war with the Ottoman Empire.t What Bismarck wanted, as always, was a sensible and realistic balance between Austria and Russia to be achieved by the partition of
1 Bismarck also empowered Schweinitz to offer the Russians a German alliance on the basis of a free hand for Germany against France and for Russia against the Turks. But the ambassador, who disliked this idea, may have deliberately refrained from pressing the proposal, which had no result.

European Turkey. He had no desire to favour one of them ostentatiously against the other; but the survival of the Habsburg Empire was now a necessity, perhaps the greatest of all necessities, for Germany. It was impossible to hide this fact completely; and therefore impossible to avoid arousing resentment in Russia. Gorchakov and the Tsar, with memories of the way in which Russia in 1870 had offered to concentrate 300,000 men on the Galician frontier if Austria showed signs of intervening in the Franco—Prussian war, were bitterly disappointed by the coolness of the answer. The danger of an Austro—Russian collision was now clearly increasing. At the end of September, General Sumarokoy-Elston had been sent by the Russian government to Vienna to suggest that the Porte be forced to agree to an armistice with Serbia and to accept peace terms to be laid down by the powers. This was to be done by the simultaneous Austrian occupation of Bosnia and Russian occupation of Bulgaria. The Austrian government refused this proposal, though it agreed to joint naval pressure by the powers at Constantinople and promised not to oppose the advance of the Russian army into European Turkey. As a result the anti-Austrian attitude typified by Ignatiev gained further ground in Russian ruling circles. Since the Turks, encouraged by the disunity of the powers (which was stressed by both the British and the Austrian ambassadors at the Porte) continued to refuse an armistice, an imperial council held on 15 October at Livadia decided on partial mobilisation of the Russian army. The situation was still far from hopeless. There was powerful opposition to war within the Russian government; Milyutin disliked the idea and Reutern argued strongly in favour of peace. General Obruchey, the Russian chief of staff, had in any case planned, greatly to Ignatiev’s indignation, for a relatively small-scale military effort in the Balkans with the Caucasus as a completely secondary theatre of operations. Moreover on 4, November Lord Derby suggested in a circular to the powers the calling of a conference at Constantinople to elaborate yet another scheme of reform for the Ottoman Empire; and to this they all agreed. The omens, however, were not favourable to the maintenance of peace. The Porte accepted the idea of the Constantinople conference only with the greatest reluctance on 18 November, after Derby had made it clear that the alternative was a Russo—Turkish war and had threatened to abandon the Turks to their fate if one broke out. Austria, which was throughout the crisis the most indifferent of the powers immediately concerned to the sufferings of the Balkan Christians, was also markedly unenthusiastic. Above all on 11 November the Tsar, in a speech to the nobility and municipal
190


THE EASTERN CRISIS 1876
authorities of Moscow, made it clear that Russia would act independently if the powers failed to agree at Constantinople and to secure guarantees that the reforms they wished for would be carried out. Two days later this threat was given additional weight by the mobilisation of six Russian army corps. All the real work of the Constantinople conference was done during the first weeks of December in preliminary meetings from which the Turkish representatives were excluded. It was agreed without much difficulty to unite Bosnia and Herzegovina in a single province under a governor appointed by the Porte with the consent of the powers. Serbia and Montenegro were to be given some small territorial gains; though the latter, in spite of Ignatiev’s efforts, gained no outlet to the sea. The position of Bulgaria proved much more difficult to settle. Ignatiev, anticipating the demands he was to put forward over a year later, proposed the creation of a very large autonomous state stretching from the Black Sea far to the west into Old Serbia and with a considerable Aegean coastline. Its governor was to be irremovable by the Porte and a foreign (i.e. Russian) army was to occupy it while its administration was being organised. Under pressure from Salisbury, the chief British delegate at the conference, and his Austrian colleague Count Zichy, this scheme was modified in two important respects. It was agreed that the southern frontiers of Bulgaria should run from Adrianople to Monastir (in other words the Aegean outlet was abandoned) and also that the new state should be divided into eastern and western halves. Nevertheless even these revised proposals represented a substantial success for Ignatiev. Salisbury, unlike Sir Henry Elliot, the very Turcophil British ambassador in Constantinople, had no belief in the vitality of the Ottoman Empire or the desirability of preserving it. He did not wish to see Russia dominant in the Balkans; but in practice he worked surprisingly closely with Ignatiev. The labours of these preparatory meetings were quite futile. On the morning of 23 December, as the first plenary session of the conference opened, the delegates were startled by the sound of the salutes fired to mark the promulgation of a new constitution by the Sultan.! This, announced Safvet Pasha, the Turkish Foreign Minister, changed the whole position. The changes proposed by the powers were now unnecessary since the constitution, which provided

It had been approved in draft by the council of ministers on 6 December, but conservative influences delayed for a fortnight its acceptance by Abdul Hamid. Its significance is discussed by R.

for an elected parliament and nominated senate, for an independent judiciary and considerable decentralisation of provincial government, guaranteed the liberties of all the Sultan’s subjects. It was clear that the proposals of the powers would be rejected. Resentment of foreign interference in the affairs of the empire was now intense in Constantinople and on 18 January 1877 a council of notables, which included representatives of the Christian millets, voted almost unanimously against accepting them. In face of this Turkish obstinacy the powers were helpless because of their disunity. The Russian government still wished, if it went to war with the Porte, to act if possible as the representative of the European powers rather than independently. It still hoped to achieve its aims in the Near East by merely political pressure on the Turks. But the powers refused to force the Porte to accept their proposals as Ignatiev wished, and the isolation of Russia on this point was clear. Resentment of what seemed to many Russians the pro-Austrian attitude of Bismarck was gathering strength in St. Petersburg. For his part the German Chancellor was alarmed, or at least pretended to be, by the efforts of the French government to improve relations with Russia and Britain and thus isolate Germany; he reacted by efforts to draw closer to Britain and Austria. Above all the Turks knew they need fear no effective British pressure if they stood firm. The attitude of Elliot during and after the conference, and his open disagreement with Salisbury, had made this clear. He was supported by Beaconsfield, who refused Salisbury’s request that the ambassador be recalled and the British fleet sent to the Bosphorus to coerce Abdul Hamid into accepting the proposals of the conference. Sir Stafford Northcote, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Lord Carnarvon, the Colonial Secretary, disliked Beaconsfield’s Turcophil attitude and supported Salisbury; but they could not carry the cabinet with them against the Prime Minister. In mid-January Odian-Effendi, a very influential Armenian adviser of Midhat who had just visited London and Paris, reported that no British action need be feared if the Porte disregarded the wishes of the powers. The result of this disunity was that the powers considerably whittled down their proposals. They withdrew the suggestion that the governors of the two Bulgarian provinces should be Christians and also that for the creation of a Belgian gendarmerie to supervise the carrying-out of reforms there. But these concessions also were quite ineffective. On 20 January the conference broke up in defeat. On 5 February Midhat Pasha, who had been Grand Vizier since 19 December, was suddenly exiled to Brindisi; Ottoman conservatism

The Tsar and his ministers now made a last effort to achieve some
united action by the powers. In March, Ignatiev toured the major European capitals — Berlin, Paris, London and Vienna. In each he proposed that the Turks be forced to demobilise and to introduce a programme of reforms whose execution would be supervised by the powers. In both London and Vienna he found a disquieting tendency to demand that Russia also should agree to demobilise before any agreement could be signed;! and the protocol which the powers signed on 31 March was a considerably watered-down version of Ignatiev’s proposals. Even so it was agreed to by the British government only with much hesitation and important reservations; and on g April it was rejected by the Sultan. On the 24th Russia declared war on the Ottoman Empire. Three months earlier, as the Constantinople conference petered out, the way for a Russo—Turkish war had been cleared by a new Austro—Russian agreement which amplified that made at Reichstadt. Ever since the autumn of 1876 the Tsar and his ministers had been trying to clarify the attitude of the Habsburg Monarchy in case the concert of Europe, through which they still hoped to work, broke down in the Near East and forced Russia to act independently of the other powers. On 15 January they signed with Austria a military convention. On 18 March they added to it a political agreement which was antedated to 15 January to show that the two were intended to form parts of a single whole. The military convention provided for Austria to observe benevolent neutrality in case of a Russo—Turkish war. In return she was to be allowed to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina at a time of her own choosing. Serbia, Montenegro and the Sanjak of Novibazar were to constitute a neutral zone and were to be invaded by the forces of neither power; Serbia and Montenegro were to be allowed to give military help to Russia only outside their own territory. Austrian troops were not to invade Rumania. The political convention of 18 March provided for an Austrian annexation (not merely occupation as agreed in January) of Bosnia and Herzegovina; the fate of the Sanjak was to be decided by later agreement. Russia was to recover southern Bessarabia and
the two powers were to support each other diplomatically if the
territorial changes produced by the war were subjected to the ‘collective deliberation’ of the great states of Europe.
1 The fact that Montenegro was still at war with the Porte made it difficult for Russia to agree to this.
193


1877 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 The agreement had important gaps. It said nothing about possible Russian territorial gains in Asia, though strategically and economically these were likely to be much more important than southern Bessarabia. More surprisingly, the fate of Bulgaria was left very much in the air since there were as yet no clear-cut ideas in St. Petersburg about its future. It was agreed, however, that no large state, ‘Slav or other’, was to be formed in the Balkans. If the Ottoman Empire disintegrated Thessaly, Crete and southern Epirus might go to Greece while Constantinople became a free city. These agreements were a victory for Austria. She was to receive Bosnia and Herzegovina, and all this implied in terms of increased influence over the South Slavs and in the western Balkans, in return for mere neutrality. Russia had, at least by implication, recognised Serbia as falling within the orbit of Habsburg power and had been promised no direct gain except southern Bessarabia which had little more than prestige value. But she had freed her hands for action against the Turks, though at heavy cost. Austria was the only power whose military opposition in the Balkans need be feared. For the time being at least she had been bought off and was reliably neutral. The diplomatic foundations for the Russo—Turkish war were completed by two conventions signed on 16 April by Russia and Rumania. These provided for Russian control of the Rumanian railways and for free passage for Russian troops through Rumanian territory. The Turks thereupon declared war on Rumania on 8 May: on the gist the Rumanian government proclaimed the country independent. But the differences between Russia and Rumania, like those between Russia and Austria-Hungary, had been glossed over rather than finally settled. Russia was determined to recover southern Bessarabia. Before the end of 1876 it had been made clear to the Rumanian government that it would lose the province if a Russo—Turkish war broke out, though it was promised in return independence and territorial compensation elsewhere. For this reason Prince Charles was told on 25 May that Russia did not need Rumania’s alliance or Rumanian military support; it was easier and less embarrassing to annex a Rumanian province if the country were not formally allied to Russia. But the shaky position of the dynasty in Bucharest and the violence and irresponsibility of the country’s politics made it difficult for any Rumanian government to accept the loss of even a small part of the national territory. It was only the growing ascendancy in the cabinet from May 1876 onwards of the Radicals led by Bratianu and Rosetti which made possible the conventions of 16 April 1877. Hoping for independence and a great Rumanian state on the lines of that of 1919, the Radical leaders
194


THE EASTERN CRISIS 1877 were prepared, very reluctantly, to sacrifice southern Bessarabia if it
were unavoidable. But the province remained an insuperable obstacle to good Russo—Rumanian relations. The advance of the Russian armies into Turkish territory was not
very rapid — they crossed the Danube only at the end of June — but until the last week in July they appeared to be carrying all before them in Europe. The Turks were in many ways better equipped, the result of the lavish expenditure, particularly on the navy, which had marked the reign of Abdul Aziz. They had better rifles, excellent Krupp artillery and complete naval command of the Black Sea. They also attempted, though without success, to use in their favour the Panislamic feeling which was now coming into existence in many parts of the Moslem world.! But the mediocrity and personal animosities of their commanders, and above all the extreme poorness of their staff-work, more than nullified these advantages. It was only at the end of July that the Russian advance was checked by the resistance of the hitherto almost unknown fortress of Plevna in Bulgaria. But the check was of critical importance. The fortress did not fall until 11 December. Its prolonged resistance altered the complexion of the war and set limits to what Russia could hope to achieve politically in case of victory. In Armenia also the Russian armies achieved little until the storming of Kars in November. The main interest of the first weeks of fighting lies in the struggle which they saw between the more moderate influences affecting Russian policy, led by Shuvalov and Gorchakov, and the more extreme ones represented by the Panslavs and the military commanders. The former feared European intervention and also revolutionary activity in Russia if the war were prolonged. They therefore wished to end it quickly and to create an autonomous Bulgaria which would not extend south of the Balkan mountains. Shuvalov even hoped that the war could be ended without a crossing of the mountains by the Russian army. In return for Russian moderation Britain might promise to remain neutral and not to occupy the Straits area.? An agreement along these lines, with provision for the occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by Austria and for territorial gains by Serbia and Montenegro, was suggested to the British government by
1The most interesting of these attempts was the sending in July of a Turkish mission to Shere Ali, the Amir of Afghanistan, in an effort to secure his help against Russia (D. E. Lee, ‘A Turkish mission to Afghanistan, 1877’, Journal of Modern . xill (1941), pp. —56.

threatened by Russian action against the Suez Canal, Egypt, the Persian Gulf or
Constantinople and the Straits, and threatened that in such circumstances it might

1877 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 Gorchakov on 30 May. But the proposal was received with great
reserve in London since it left the way open for a temporary Russian
occupation of Constantinople and the Straits, and was in any case withdrawn within a few days. By mid -June military pressure had won the day and it had been decided in St. Petersburg that the new Bulgaria must extend south as well as north of the Balkan mountains. This was bound to heighten the already great suspicion with which Russia was regarded by Beaconsfield and Queen Victoria. As early as April and May there had been considerable discussion in the cabinet of the possibility of seizing the Dardanelles, though the opposition of Derby, Salisbury and Carnarvon temporarily squashed the project. By the summer the Prime Minister, with vociferous support from the Queen, was urging a policy of active resistance to the Russians upon his still reluctant colleagues. On 6 June he ordered Sir Henry Layard, who had now succeeded Elliot as ambassador in Constantinople, to persuade the Sultan to ask for the British fleet to be sent to the Turkish capital and for a British occupation of Gallipoli. This, he wrote, would give Britain ‘a commanding position when the conditions of peace are discussed’.1 On 30 June the British Mediterranean squadron was ordered to move to Besika Bay; and on 17 July Derby warned Shuvalov that the Russians could not rely on British neutrality if they occupied Constantinople, even temporarily and for military reasons. On the 21st the cabinet agreed to declare war if Russia seized the Turkish capital and made no arrangements for its immediate evacuation. It also agreed to increase the garrison of Malta; and on the 28th Layard was again told that the British fleet would be sent up to the Turkish capital if the Sultan asked for it. Beaconsfield’s exuberant imagination surpassed itself in dreams of attacking Russia in Asia in case of an Anglo—Russian conflict. “The Empress of India’, he wrote with all his usual flamboyance, ‘should order her armies to clear Central Asia of the Moscovites, and drive them into the Caspian.”* On 6 August, in a letter to Layard, he envisaged the invasion of Russian Armenia by a British army and even the capture of Tiflis. Such schemes were extravagant futility. More important and far more threatening to Russia were the Anglo—Austrian negotiations, also inspired largely by Beaconsfield, which began in May and which the British government hoped might lead to an agreement for co-operation against Russia. These hopes were disappointed. Andrassy certainly wished for British support if Russia failed to observe the conventions of 15 January and 18 March and had to be * Monypenny and Buckle, op. cit. vi. 146. 2 Thid. vi. 155.
196


THE EASTERN CRISIS 1877 restrained by force from going too far in the Balkans. But he had no
desire, for the time being at least, to commit himself to a definitely
anti-Russian line in alliance with Britain and perhaps be used as a
British tool. On 29 May he listed seven points which Austria would
not accept in any Balkan settlement — the main ones were a gain of territory by Russia on the right bank of the Danube, a Russian occupation of Constantinople, an exclusive protectorate of any one power over the Balkan Christians and the creation in the Balkans of a large Slav state at the expense of the non-Slav peoples of the peninsula. These he repeated in a declaration of 26 July to the British government. But this fell far short of the Anglo—Austrian alliance for which Beaconsfield had hoped; and by August, when the seriousness of the check which the Russians had suffered at Plevna became clear, the negotiations between London and Vienna had petered out. The failure of a second Russian assault on Plevna on 30 July forced the Tsar and his ministers to alter their attitude to the Balkan states. Hitherto, confident in their own strength, they had rejected all offers of help from them. Serbia had been advised to remain neutral. Greece had been refused the alliance she demanded as a condition of entering the war on the Russian side. Rumania, as has been seen, had also had her alliance proposals rejected, while her army had been allowed only to guard the Russian lines of communication and was forbidden to cross the Danube. After the defeats at Plevna the position was completely changed. Turkish command of the Black Sea (the one benefit his empire reaped from the expensive passion of Abdul Aziz for ironclad warships) made it impossible for the Russians to use the relatively easy coastal route for their advance southwards towards Constantinople. They must instead cross the Balkan mountains. To make this safe, Plevna must be taken; and to take it Russia now needed the active help of her allies. Serbia was asked to enter the war at once, though she prudently did not do so until after Plevna had fallen. The Rumanians were asked to cross the Danube as soon as possible and all the forces around Plevna, Russian as well as Rumanian, were placed under the command of Prince Charles. The Greek government was asked to make a diversionary attack in Thrace but, impressed by the strength of the Turkish army and under pressure from Britain and Austria to remain neutral, refused to do so unless Russia would first accept its territorial demands in Thessaly and Epirus. Above all the long defence of Plevna helped to change the
British attitude to the Ottoman Empire. It provided a breathing
space in which the memory of the ‘Bulgarian horrors’ could become
197


1877-8 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
blurred and weakened. It showed that Turkey, which recently so many members even of the Conservative party had been condemning to well-merited dissolution, had still enough vitality to be
worth defending. The fortress fell at last on 11 December. With its fall the Russian advance began once more. On 4 January 1878 Russian troops entered Sofia. By the 20th they were in Adrianople. The spectre ofa complete collapse of Turkish resistance and its possible results now haunted more than ever the imaginations of Beaconsfield and many of his colleagues. On 13 December, Derby warned Shuvalov that if Constantinople and the Straits were even temporarily occupied by Russia Britain would take whatever action seemed necessary to protect her interests. Five days later the cabinet decided that Parliament should reassemble on 17 January and be asked to vote supplementary naval and military estimates in view of the danger of war with Russia. On 24 December the Porte accepted with alacrity an offer of British mediation; and on 23 January the British fleet was ordered to pass the Dardanelles and go up to Constantinople. However on the following day, after Layard had reported (wrongly as it turned out) that the Russians would not include in their peace terms new provisions relating to the Straits but would leave the position there to be regulated by European agreement, the order was countermanded. Indeed British policy, which had been marked from the beginning of the Bosnian crisis by its divisions and instability, surpassed itself in these respects in January 1878. While Beaconsfield urged the Turks to reject the Russian peace terms and continued to hint at possible British help in resisting them, Derby was advising the Sultan to cut his losses by a prompt peace, since no British or Austrian aid could be relied on. Both he and Carnarvon, the leading advocates in the cabinet of non-intervention, resigned in protest against the decision of 23 January to send the fleet to Constantinople, though they returned to office as soon as it was reversed. Renewed efforts to achieve some Anglo—Austrian alliance to restrain Russia were nullified by the bad impression which this dithering and disunity naturally produced in Vienna and by Andrassy’s continuing unwillingness to destroy the Dreikaiserbund and thus jeopardise his chances of German support. Hopes of help from Britain or of some form of international mediation continued to buoy up the Porte until the end of January; but on the 27th, with the Russians almost at the gates of Constantinople, it accepted the Russian terms for an armistice which was signed four days later. The terms were severe. An autonomous Bulgaria was to be
198


THE EASTERN CRISIS 1877-8
established with a territory at least as extensive as that given her by
the Constantinople conference. Rumania, Serbia and Montenegro
were to obtain their independence and also territorial gains at the
expense of the Ottoman Empire. Bosnia and Herzegovina were to become autonomous, the Turks were to pay a war indemnity and, most important of all from the international viewpoint, a new Russo—Turkish agreement was to safeguard Russian interests at the Straits. These terms would clearly be reflected in the peace treaty which formally ended the war. Their severity was a result of the most dangerous factor in the whole situation — the loss of influence which Gorchakov and the moderates had suffered in Russia as soon as fighting began, and the ensuing extremism of Russian policy. This extremism was seen not merely in the terms of the armistice but in the fact that Rumania, which had made considerable sacrifices in the war, was not allowed to be represented at the armistice negotiations. Prince Charles was refused a copy of the armistice agreement a fortnight after it had been signed. Until after the fall of Plevna policy was decided at the Tsar’s military headquarters, from which Gorchakov was carefully excluded; when at the end of November a conference was held there to lay down the essentials of the Russian peace terms he was not even invited to attend. Isolated at Bucharest, he was doomed to watch impotently the development of policies of which he and much of the Foreign Ministry strongly disapproved. When, after Plevna had been taken, the Tsar and therefore the centre of decision returned to St. Petersburg, Nelidov, the representative at army headquarters of the Foreign Ministry, in his turn complained bitterly of being left without information or instructions. Russian diplomacy was now as much the football of contending factions as that of Britain — perhaps more so, since as soon as the armistice had been signed Ignatiev, whose influence was temporarily dominant, began to disagree violently with some of the military leaders. Two aspects of Russia’s policy seemed particularly objectionable to her potential opponents, Britain and Austria. The first was the establishment, by Russian arms, of a large autonomous Bulgaria. As the creation of the Constantinople conference such a state might have been tolerable (though even then Austria had shown no enthusiasm for it) for it would have owed its existence to an international agreement. Now, it seemed, it must inevitably be a mere Russian satellite, a facade for Russian dominance of the Balkans and
a springboard from which a Russian attack on Constantinople could

1878 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
be launched at any time. Even more threatening was the fact that
Russia appeared to be making, quite independently, an agreement with the Ottoman Empire which was bound to have profound repercussions on the whole structure of international relations in Europe. Her victory and the armistice terms, if pressed home, meant a change in the European balance of power and, more specifically, in the regime of the Straits, now a traditional European interest. Moreover the Anglo—-Franco—Russian treaty of April 1856, by which the three powers had bound themselves to defend the integrity of the Ottoman Empire,! was still at least formally in force. On 8 January 1878, therefore, Francis Joseph told Alexander II in a personal letter that Austria would oppose the creation of a great autonomous Bulgaria; that if Russia annexed southern Bessarabia he would insist on an Austrian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina; and above all that the peace with Turkey was a European concern and that its terms could not be decided by Russia alone. A week later the British government made a similar protest; and in a circular of 25 January Gorchakov promised that those aspects of the peace settlement which were of European interest should be decided only with the agreement of the great powers. This was an important concession. But it did not prevent the development of a very dangerous Anglo—Russian crisis in the second and third weeks of February. To a:considerable extent this crisis was the result of misunderstandings on both sides and of poor and unreliable communications. Nevertheless it brought the two powers very near to war and illustrated vividly how intense their mutual dislike and suspicion had now become, above all in Britain. It was not until 8 February that Layard was able to send to London a reliable account of the armistice terms with details of the line at which the Russian advance was to halt; until this information was received it was assumed that the Russian march on Constantinople was continuing. The Queen, as before, pressed strongly for determined opposition to Russia even if this led to war. She was supported by public opinion, or at least its more vocal sections; and on the 8th the British fleet was ordered to go up from Besika Bay to Constantinople. The refusal of the Porte, now that an armistice had been signed, to grant a firman for its passage, delayed its movement for several days. However on the 13th it entered the Straits and reached the Princes Islands, only a few miles from the Turkish capital. This greatly alarmed the Turks, who feared that the Russians might use its advance as an excuse to seize Constantinople. Their fears were fully justified; for Alexander II, who concluded that the 1 Seep. 144.

Neither Russia nor Britain was in a very favourable position to fight. Russia had already suffered severely from the unexpected length and difficulty of the war with Turkey. In particular her shaky finances, always in the nineteenth century her greatest source of weakness in a serious conflict, had been desperately strained. Even in
1876 her financial position had been acutely difficult; during that
year her exports fell, her imports rose and her bullion reserves and
international credit both declined. The outbreak of war the following
year made necessary the issue of a billion roubles of new paper
currency. Reutern, the able Finance Minister, had been throughout
the most outspoken opponent of a conflict with Turkey. Only a sense
of duty prevented his resigning when it broke out, and he did so

1878 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 when it ended. By 1878 ‘Russian finances were back almost where they had been after the Crimean War’. Moreover Russia was not on good terms with any of the Balkan states; with Rumania her relations were extremely bad. In January the Rumanian government had been formally notified that Russia intended to annex southern Bessarabia and offered the Dobrudja? and the Danube delta in compensation. Bratianu and Prince Charles refused, for in the existing state of feeling in Bucharest their agreement would have meant the fall of the government and perhaps of the dynasty. They maintained their refusal even when the Viddin area of Bulgaria and a large war indemnity were added to the compensation offered them, and were then presented early in April with a Russian ultimatum which demanded the disarmament of the Rumanian army and threatened a complete military occupation of the country. In an Anglo—Russian conflict Rumania would be the opponent, not the ally, of Russia. Even the Russian military position, with long and difficult lines of communication running the entire length of the Balkan peninsula, was not as strong as it seemed. Early in May Field-Marshal Totleben, the hero of the defence of Sevastopol, and the most distinguished living Russian soldier, urged on military grounds a withdrawal to Adrianople and the adoption of a more cautious strategy designed to defend Bulgaria from attack. Britain on her side had lost a good deal of prestige by the obvious divisions and hesitations of her Near Eastern policy. Derby’s unwillingness to take any clear or far-reaching decision constantly weakened her influence; and Beaconsfield’s brave and often wild words had so far been conspicuously divorced from deeds. It was difficult for Britain to concentrate in the eastern Mediterranean a military force of her own capable of facing the Russian armies, while renewed negotiations with Austria once more produced no result. On 7 February the Habsburg council of ministers discussed the financial implications of a war with Russia. It estimated that the first three months campaigning would cost 300 million gulden; and Austria-Hungary, whose finances were almost as precarious as those of Russia, could not easily provide this sum. There had already been semi-official talks in London, conducted through Corry, Beaconsfield’s private secretary, on the possibility of British subsidies in case of an Austro—-Russian war. On 14 February, therefore,

In spite of the weakness of both the British and the Russian positions war between the two powers continued to seem probable throughout March. The resignation towards the end of the month of Derby, and his replacement by the much firmer and abler Salisbury, brought a new consistency to British policy. On 27 March the cabinet decided, rather belatedly, to bring a force of Indian troops to Malta. On the goth Alexander II, who was extremely anxious that British warships should at all costs be prevented from penetrating to the Black Sea, ordered that the Turks be forced either to concert measures with Russia for the defence of the Bosphorus or to hand over to her the forts which guarded it and to disarm their Black Sea fleet. The reluctance of the Grand Duke Nicholas to put forward such demands led to his replacement by Totleben a few days later; and during April nearly 700 officers and men of the Russian navy were sent to the United States to acquire and man there ships which could be used for privateering against British merchantmen in case of war. Only during that month did Panslav and extreme nationalist influences begin to decline in Russia, and then only slowly. Meanwhile on 3 March Ignatiev had signed with the Turks the treaty of San Stefano. Its provisions, based on those of the preliminary peace terms of 31 January, represented the fullest practical
expression ever given in Russian foreign policy to the Panslav ideal.
It created an autonomous Bulgarian state tributary to the Sultan,
which was to be ruled by an elected prince. The territory of this state
was to be a good deal larger than had been envisaged by the
Constantinople conference. In particular it was to have a consider
able stretch of Aegean coastline, though this was not to include
any port of significance — Salonika and Dedeagatch remained in
H 203


1878 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 Turkish hands. Though not formally independent, the Bulgaria of
San Stefano would be much larger and potentially at least much
more powerful than any other state in the Balkans; its creation was
the central achievement of the peace treaty. San Stefano also provided for very large territorial gains by Montenegro, which was almost to treble in size, whereas Serbia received only some relatively small areas on her southern and south-western borders
— Nish, Leskovach and a part of the Sanjak of Novibazar. This difference of treatment reflected the disappointment widely felt in Russia as a result of Serbia’s poor military performance against the Turks, and also a feeling that isolated and primitive Montenegro was more reliably Slav than Serbia with its westernised prince and largely westernised politicians. Both states were to become independent. Rumania also was to achieve independence; but Russia reserved the right to take southern Bessarabia from her and to compensate her with the Dobrudja. The reforms proposed by the Constantinople conference were to be introduced in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Cretan statute of 1868 was to be strictly carried out and similar ones were to be introduced in Epirus, Thessaly and the other disjointed remnants of its European possessions which the treaty left to the Porte. There was also a vaguely-worded provision for the introduction of reforms in Turkish Armenia and for guarantees for the protection of the Armenians against the Circassians and Kurds. Turkey was to pay a large war-indemnity, though part of this was to be offset against the accession to Russia of the Dobrudja and the islands of the Danube delta, and of Ardahan, Kars, Batum and Bayezid in Asia Minor. These terms might have been even more severe; for Gorchakov’s original instructions to Ignatiev envisaged the inclusion in the treaty of a clause providing for the joint defence of the Straits by Russia and Turkey, though the idea was soon abandoned as certain to provoke the opposition of the powers. Ignatiev on his own initiative demanded without success that part of the war indemnity be paid by the surrender by the Turks of six warships to be selected by the Russian Navy Minister; he also tried unsuccessfully to secure the inclusion in the treaty of a secret clause by which Russia and the Ottoman Empire promised mutual support against any effort to change its terms. Nevertheless the peace, in spite of these Russian concessions, represented for the Turks a defeat more dangerous than those of 1774 and 1829. The Porte would clearly have little control of the new autonomous Bulgaria, which was in any case to be under Russian military occupation for two years; and with most of its remaining territory in Europe communication would be possible only by sea.

1 Though Bismarck, true to his cautious and non-committal policy in the Near
East, rather disliked the selection of Berlin as a meeting-place since this would tend
to involve Germany in unwelcome responsibility for its decisions. He still adhered
firmly to the belief that a partition of the Ottoman Empire between the interested
powers was the best solution of all Near Eastern problems. (Saint-Vallier to
Waddington, 2 March 1878, Documents Diplomatiques Francais, 1st series, 1. 261-3.)

1878 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
On the other hand Andrassy was clearly willing to give only limited help to Britain. As has already been seen, he had now abandoned any idea of war with Russia; and the western Balkans were the only part of the Near East in which really important Austrian interests were at stake. Thus the advances made to him by Salisbury as soon as the latter became Foreign Secretary were unproductive; they merely showed once more that little except dislike of Russia united Britain and the Habsburg Monarchy. The result was that during April Salisbury began slowly to move towards the idea of a direct Anglo—Russian agreement on the Near East. As the influence of Ignatiev declined in St. Petersburg and that of the European-minded Foreign Ministry officials and diplomats, notably Shuvalov, increased, the same idea began to take root in Russia. On g April the British government, through the intermediacy of Bismarck, agreed to negotiate with Russia for a simultaneous withdrawal of the Russian army from San Stefano to Adrianople and of the British fleet from the Straits. But this idea, reasonably enough, was disliked in St. Petersburg. Such an agreement would do nothing to strengthen Russia but would help the British by giving them more time in which to concentrate in the Levant forces from India and elsewhere. Before the end of the month Bismarck had abandoned his efforts to arrange a concurrent withdrawal of this kind. Nevertheless the dangerous gulf between Britain and Russia was slowly being bridged, with Shuvalov as the chief bridge-builder. Early in May he had a series of important discussions with Salisbury and on the 8th he left for St. Petersburg. With him he carried a copy of a cabinet memorandum which detailed the British objections to the San Stefano peace terms. These centred largely on the new autonomous Bulgaria and the territorial gains for which Russia hoped in Asia. Salisbury did not object to the provisions of the treaty which affected Serbia and Montenegro, or to the Russian annexation of southern Bessarabia. But the threat which the new Bulgaria offered to the remnants of Turkish power in Europe must be reduced. Equally important, Russia could not be allowed, by gaining the great fortresses of Turkish Armenia, to strengthen her position and prestige all over western Asia and make herself apparently even more of a threat to British power in India. Before he left London, Shuvalov had hinted that Russia might be willing to divide the new Bulgaria along the line of the Balkan mountains if the southern half received very full administrative autonomy. When he reached St. Petersburg he found the Tsar willing to accept a settlement on those lines. The financial difficulties of Russia were as great as ever. The Populist revolutionaries who

These were considerable concessions. Beaconsfield and the Queen, as might have been expected, did not think they went far enough. But Salisbury insisted on their acceptance; and on 30 May an Anglo—Russian agreement was signed. The three memoranda in which it was embodied laid down in general terms the new southern and western frontiers of Bulgaria and provided for its division along the Balkan mountains. The frontier between the two Bulgarias was not defined, however; nor were the military rights to be retained by the Ottoman Empire in the southern one. Britain accepted the Russian annexation of Kars, Batum and southern Bessarabia; but Salisbury was careful to reserve freedom of action on a number of points, above all on that of any changes to be made in the regime of the Straits. The agreement of 30 May was thus a good deal less than a complete settlement of all the questions at issue between Britain and Russia. It still left scope for plenty of violent disagreement between them; and only a few days earlier, on 18 May, signs of a Russian movement from San Stefano towards Constantinople had produced a burst of alarm in London. But it ended all real danger of an Anglo-Russian war, while the success of the negotiations with Russia made Andrassy, in fear of isolation, himself come to terms with Britain a few days later. On 6 June Britain and the Habsburg Empire agreed that the northernmost of the two Bulgarias should not extend south of the Balkan mountains or west of the river Morava.
The Russian military occupation of it should last for only six months
and be limited to a force of 20,000 men. In the southern Principality
the Sultan must have powers to suppress revolt or repel outside
attack. Britain was to support any proposal Austria might make concerning the fate of Bosnia.
207


1878 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
These two agreements ensured for the British government a reasonably satisfactory settlement of the problems of European Turkey. In Asia it achieved much less. The agreement of 30 May left Russia with most of her gains in Armenia and it was clear that Austria would do little to restrain her outside the Balkans, above all the western Balkans. But to British statesmen, and notably to Beaconsfield himself, the preservation of the Ottoman Empire was necessary in 1877-8 above all because that empire was an indirect support of British power in Asia.1 If it collapsed it might be possible to keep Constantinople and the Straits out of Russian hands. But the way would be open for a Russian advance through eastern Anatolia to the Mediterranean or the Persian Gulf. Such an advance would strike a great blow at British prestige all over Asia. It would give Russia a dominant position in the ramshackle Persian state and perhaps in Afghanistan. Above all it would make her an imminent threat to what was now the main artery of British communications with India. Layard stressed these points heavily. “I am convinced’, he wrote to Lord Lytton, the Viceroy of India, on 14 June, ‘that if she (Russia) annexes Armenia our Indian Empire will be exposed to the most serious peril. The north of Persia must follow and if Russia further succeeds in opening the Bosphorus and Dardanelles to her fleet our roads to India are at her mercy, whether by Suez, Mesopotamia or Herat.’* The maintenance of Turkish power in Asia was thus, more than ever before, a fundamental objective of British policy. Moreover the fact that most of the population of Asia Minor was Moslem made a Turcophil policy there less open to the criticism of the Liberal opposition and religious groups generally than a similar policy in the Balkans. The need to strengthen Britain’s hold on the Suez route to India, and therefore to strengthen the Ottoman Empire in Asia as a bulwark of that route, had been occupying statesmen and public opinion in Britain for some years. In November 1875 the Khedive Ismail, in desperate straits for money,’ had sold to the British government his holding of almost 177,000 shares in the Suez Canal company. From February 1876 onwards there were three British members on its Board of Directors. This famous transaction, described by Leopold II

THE EASTERN CRISIS 1875-8 of the Belgians as ‘the greatest event of modern politics’, intro
duced a new element into Anglo—Egyptian relations. In the British press, and indeed all over Europe, it was seen as heralding an imminent seizure of Egypt by Britain; but with the despatch in May 1876 of the British fleet to Besika Bay, Constantinople and the Straits began to replace Egypt as the main focus of British official interest in the Near East. By the end of the year the idea of obtaining a base somewhere in the Levant was gaining ground in London. Beaconsfield, in a letter of 29 November to Salisbury, spoke of his hopes of acquiring ‘some commanding stronghold in Turkey from which we need never recede’; with typical lack of realism he thought the Porte might be willing to sell the Black Sea port of Varna for this purpose.? Colonel Home, the British officer sent in December to report on the defences of Constantinople and the possibility of using British troops to protect it, urged strongly that Britain should not attempt to prop up the tottering Ottoman Empire. ‘I think the time has come to cut it up and let us have our share of it,’ he wrote on 26 December;? and in the following month he put forward detailed proposals for a British seizure of the Dardanelles, an idea which recurred more than once during the inconclusive cabinet discussions of the following summer. The year 1877, largely because of the influence of Layard, who stressed much more than his predecessor in Constantinople the need to defend Asia Minor and Armenia against Russian attack, saw the search for a British base move further east. At the end of March 1878 Beaconsfield suggested the island of Cyprus. Layard and General Simmons, the Inspector-General of Fortifications, rightly doubted its value as a centre for the defence of Asiatic Turkey. The ambassador advocated instead a base in Mesopotamia; and other possibilities — Lemnos, Mitylene, Crete, Alexandretta — were discussed. Of these Alexandretta was the only serious rival to Cyprus; but it was eventually turned down because, being on the mainland, it had no well-defined frontiers, and because any acquisition of territory in Syria would arouse a strong hostile reaction in France. Some time in late April or early May — the exact date is unknown — it was decided to make Cyprus a British base. The Turks showed no enthusiasm for this. On 23 May, however, Layard was ordered to present to the Porte a draft agreement for the British occupation of the island and to demand its acceptance

1878 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 within forty-eight hours. Abdul Hamid, faced with the threat that ifhe refused Britain would abandon the Ottoman Empire to its fate, gave way. On 4 June, the Cyprus Convention was signed. Britain agreed that if Russia kept Batum, Kars or Ardahan when peace was made she would defend the Sultan’s Asiatic possessions against any future Russian attack. To help her carry out this promise she was to be allowed to occupy Cyprus, though the island was to remain under Turkish sovereignty and any surplus of revenue over expenditure in it was to be refunded by the British government to the Porte. The Sultan also agreed, in general terms, to introduce in his Asiatic territories reforms for the protection of his Christian subjects. Not until 6 July, however, did Abdul Hamid issue a firman for the British occupation of the island; and then only after more threats and pressure from London. The convention was made public two days later. The Congress of Berlin, which opened on 13 June, was the last great international gathering of the ‘old diplomacy’, the last to be held before democracy and small-state nationalism transformed international relations so much for the worse. Its strengths and weaknesses stemmed from the fact that it was in all essentials a gathering merely of a small group of great powers. Bulgaria bulked larger than any other issue in its discussions: 22 of the 54 articles of the treaty it produced dealt with Bulgarian problems. But the Bulgarians were unrepresented and unheard. The Russian government insisted on acting as their spokesman and successfully obstructed their efforts to send petitions and a deputation to state their case to the powers. The Bosnians and Herzegovinians, who had set off this complex series of crises in the summer of 1875, received no better treatment; a Bosnian rebel leader appeared in Berlin but was completely ignored by the delegates there. The complaints and demands of the Lazes (the tribes inhabiting the Batum area) the Pomaks (Bulgarian Moslems who had revolted against Russian military rule in May 1878) and the Armenians received no greater attention. Serbia, Montenegro and Rumania were not admitted to the congress, though they were allowed to state their claims to it. Greece, which as an independent state was admitted, had it made clear to her that her desires and grievances were of very secondary importance to the powers. Delyannis, her representative at Berlin, demanded Crete, Thessaly and Epirus; but only the French delegates gave him any support. Bismarck, as chairman of the congress, bullied mercilessly Caratheodory Pasha, the chief Turkish delegate, a sign that the Ottoman Empire itself was only a minor factor in the solution of the problems facing the congress. ‘At Potsdam there are
210


THE EASTERN CRISIS 1878
mosquitoes — here there are minor powers,’ wrote Salisbury, who
with Beaconsfield led the British delegation. ‘I don’t know which is
worse.’! But this snubbing and ignoring of the Balkan peoples and governments, whatever its defects, had two great practical advantages. It allowed negotiations to be confined to a very small number of representatives of the great powers? and thus to be kept, in general, confidential. ‘All questions are publicly introduced’, wrote Beaconsfield to Queen Victoria on 17 June, ‘and then privately settled.’ Coupled with the desire of Bismarck to push on the work of the congress as fast as possible and the strict control he was able to exert over its proceedings, it also ensured that decisions were taken quickly. By 22 June it had been agreed that the autonomous Bulgaria should include Varna and part (it was not clear how much) of the Sanjak of Sofia. In return she must give up some of the Macedonian territory ceded to her at San Stefano.* A day or two later agreement was reached on a more hotly-contested issue — the right of the Turks to garrison the frontier between Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia (the rather meaningless name given, on British insistence, to the southern half of San Stefano Bulgaria). This represented a victory, though eventually a rather unreal one, for the British delegation; there is a picturesque though probably inaccurate story that on 21 June, at the height of the struggle with the Russians over this point, Beaconsfield had ordered a special train for its departure from Berlin if it could not carry the day. The Russian military occupation of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia was to end within nine months of the exchange of ratifications of the treaty, that of Rumania within a year. For nine months the administration of Bulgaria was to be controlled by a Russian commissary. But he was to be assisted, and therefore restrained, by the consuls of the powers. These provisions, taken as a whole, met adequately the British demand that the Bulgaria of San Stefano be reduced to proportions which did not make her an imminent threat to the existence of the Ottoman Empire in Europe. They also gave the Porte a defensible frontier along the line of the Balkan mountains. The British delegates were able to achieve their

1878 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 essential aims in Bulgaria partly because they enjoyed strong
Austrian backing. In return they supported an Austrian occupation
of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was agreed to on 28 June.* Three
days later, after complex and confused negotiations, Russia agreed
to Austrian domination of the Sanjak of Novibazar and in an agreement of 13 July promised not to object if the Habsburg Monarchy were compelled to occupy it also. Serbia, Rumania and Montenegro were all given formal independence as a result of the congress. But otherwise its results were deeply disappointing to them. Serbia gained merely a triangle of territory to the south-east of her existing frontiers, though this included the important city of Nish, and her disillusionment with the territorial settlement and Russian support of Bulgaria against her drove her at once into a rapprochement with the Habsburg Empire. By a convention with Austria of 8 July, she bound herself to build a railway through her territory as part of the Vienna—Constantinople line which was now planned.? Her government refused to agree to the customs union with the Habsburg territories which Andrassy proposed; but Russophil feeling was now at a lower ebb in Belgrade than ever before. Montenegro also gained little territorially by the settlement. Of the three Adriatic ports of Antivari, Dulcigno and Spizza given her by the treaty of San Stefano she was allowed to keep only the first; and even at Antivari she was forbidden to maintain warships of her own or receive foreign ones, for fear it might become a Russian naval base. Rumania exchanged the Dobrudja and the Danube delta for southern Bessarabia, but with extreme reluctance and because her consent was made a prerequisite of the recognition of her independence by the powers. Russia had wiped out the humiliation of the territorial loss suffered in 1856, but at the cost‘of creating a lasting fund of ill will in Bucharest. Britain found it more difficult to get her own way in the Asiatic than in the European settlement. The main point at issue here was the position of Batum which the Russians, in spite of great efforts, had failed to capture before the armistice was signed. It had been agreed that Russia should annex the port, which was useful to her as giving easy sea communication from her southern provinces to Georgia and Transcaucasia. The’ British delegates, however, were very anxious that it should not become a Russian naval base: and
* The Turkish government refused to agree to the occupation until, on the. very last day of the congress, Andrassy signed a meaningless but face-saving AustroTurkish declaration that it was merely provisional and did not affect the, ultimate sovereignty of the Sultan over the two provinces. 2 It was not completed until a decade later.

that its demilitarisation should be written into the terms of the settlement. The early days of July thus saw an intense AngloRussian struggle over its future status. In this struggle Bismarck threw his weight on the Russian side; since Austria was not involved he ran no risk of weakening the Dreikaiserbund still further by doing so. By 6 July, the Russians had agreed to make some small territorial concessions to Turkey in the areas populated by Lazes tribes.t They had also agreed that Batum should be a free port. ‘This however did

1878 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 not meet Britain’s point with regard to its demilitarisation; and Salisbury worked hard to ensure that in the treaty it should be described as ‘exclusively commercial’. For a moment he succeeded. But Beaconsfield, old, deaf and in poor health, was eventually outwitted on this point by Gorchakov.1 The treaty in its final form specified merely that Batum should be ‘essentially commercial’; this left the way open for its fortification by the Russians, though it was not until 1886 they began to take advantage of the fact. The city never became of great military significance and Salisbury himself correctly thought its status a relatively minor issue which Russophobe newspapers in Britain had grossly magnified. ‘Its real importance’, he wrote, ‘is not very large, but the mass of the people are so ignorant about it that a few strenuous Jingoes have contrived to persuade the world it is a great matter.’? The struggle over it reflects British popular hostility to Russia rather than the existence of any great British strategic interest. The attitude of the Russians to Batum and their other gains in Asia, like their attitude to nearly all the questions discussed at Berlin, was essentially defensive. The Cyprus Convention seemed in St. Petersburg a real threat to Russian interests, especially as it at once produced in Britain a crop of schemes for railway-building in Asia Minor and Mesopotamia. On the day that the signature of the convention was announced a syndicate headed by the Duke of Sutherland was formed to build a railway from the Persian Gulf to Constantinople. On 5 August Salisbury proposed that Abdul Hamid be asked to grant a concession for a British-controlled line from Alexandretta to Baghdad. Waddington, the chief French delegate at Berlin, wrote on 14 July that the British occupation of Cyprus ‘constitutes a permanent threat to her (Russia) and creates a state of uneasiness extremely dangerous to her possessions in Armenia’.? Point was given to this remark when, in a despatch of 8 August to Layard, Salisbury outlined a far-reaching scheme of reform for Asia Minor. A militia organised and officered by Europeans was to be set up. Central judicial tribunals with jurisdiction over local lawcourts were to be created, each with a European member. Responsible tax-collectors were to be appointed in each vilayet; and most of these were to be Europeans. This programme,
* Neither was well-equipped to deal with the question. Salisbury complained that Beaconsfield had never seen a map of Asia Minor. Shuvalov alleged that Gorchakov could not indicate even approximately the positions of Kars and Batum (W. N. Medlicott, The Congress of Berlin and After (London, 1938), p. 107). The lack of reliable maps made it particularly difficult to settle the frontier in Asia Minor along sensible lines (ibid., pp. 119-20). * Cecil, op. cit. ii. 286. % Documents Diplomatiques Frangais, ist series, ii. 357.
214


THE EASTERN CRISIS 1878 which would have placed control of the area mainly in non-Turkish hands, was never carried out, in spite of the acceptance of parts of it by the Sultan on 24 October. Moreover repeated Turkish requests for a British loan to relieve the desperate financial position of the government were refused. By the spring of 1879, however, new British consuls-general had been appointed for Anatolia and Kurdistan, in addition to the consular representatives already there, while six new military vice-consuls were about to be stationed in the area. It is not surprising that fears of British dominance of Asia Minor were now alarming Russian statesmen and diplomats. By September 1879 Milyutin was assuring William I of Germany that ‘England is organizing and arming Asia Minor; officials, generals, and officers disguised as consuls flood that country: that means hostile intentions against our possessions in the Caucasus... . The conflict in the East is at hand’.t However aggressive Russian policies and achievements may have seemed in London those of Britain now appeared at least equally threatening in St. Petersburg. And the last stages of the congress saw Russian fears given new force and apparent justification. In the first days of negotiation at Berlin, Salisbury had hoped to offset a Russian acquisition of Batum by obtaining the right to send a British fleet into the Black Sea whenever this seemed necessary to defend the Ottoman Empire; but an effort to make an agreement with the Porte along those lines had no effect. On 29 June, however, the cabinet, on Salisbury’s suggestion, agreed that if Russia obtained the right to fortify Batum, Britain should reply by declaring that she regarded all the treaties regarding the Straits which she had previously signed as merely unilateral agreements with the Sultan. They would no longer, therefore, impose obligations on her towards the other powers of Europe. On 11 July Salisbury read to the congress a formal declaration that Britain’s obligations respecting the closure of the Straits were limited to an agreement to respect the ‘independent determinations’ of the Sultan in the matter, though these should conform to the spirit of the existing treaties. In other words the Sultan could allow the British fleet to pass through the Straits into the Black Sea whenever he chose; the international agreement on the regime of the Straits which had existed since 1841 had been seriously shaken. At the next sitting Shuvalov read a counter-declaration which asserted that the principle of the closure of the Straits was a European one. The existing treaties, he asserted, created obligations of the European powers to one another, and not merely to the Sultan as the British government claimed. 1 Medlicott, op. cit., p. 383.
215


1878 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
There was no discussion of the matter. Both declarations were inserted in the protocols of the congress and the British one was not intended to have any immediate practical result. But a new impetus had been given to the anti-British feeling which was to develop markedly in Russia during the last two decades of the century. The war of 1877-8 had driven home in St. Petersburg the fact that Russia still possessed no Black Sea fleet of any significance. Moreover her financial difficulties made it extremely hard for her to create one quickly; she did not in fact begin to do so until 1886. The principle that the Straits should be closed to warships of all foreign powers was thus of the greatest importance to Russia. Ifit were overturned, and in any future Anglo—Russian war the Sultan could allow a British squadron to pass into the Black Sea, all south Russia would be open to attack. From the beginning the Straits Convention of 1841 had benefited Russia at least as much as Great Britain and probably far more. Its own weakness now compelled the Russian government to entrench itself behind the principle which the Convention embodied. For the time being at least Russia’s attitude to the Straits was entirely defensive and the negotiations of 1879-81, which culminated in the formation of the Second Dreikaiserbund, saw a sustained and successful effort to obtain German support against the claims made in Salisbury’s declaration. It would be a mistake to see the Congress of Berlin as a complete defeat for Russia. She had won, though with difficulty, a great military victory over the Turks: its effects could not be wished out of existence. The negotiations of 1878 took place against the background of a Russian army within two hours march of Constantinople. Moreover the treaty of San Stefano had real virtues. The Bulgaria established by it corresponded fairly well with the areas which, according to the best available information, were inhabited mainly by Bulgarians.1 Much of the achievement of the Russian armies and Russian diplomacy was therefore permanent. The congress modified the treaty of San Stefano; it did not nullify it or wish to do so. An acute British commentator, very hostile to Beaconsfield and the government, claimed that except on a few points ‘we find that the whole pith and substance of the Treaty of Berlin is a mere adoption, more or less grudging and reluctant, of the great deliverances effected by the Treaty of San Stefano’. Certainly the extent to which the San Stefano settlement was modified at Berlin was bitterly resented by many people in St. Petersburg. Conservatives

feared that the result of the congress would weaken the autocracy in Russia and help to produce a revolution there. Slavophils were violently critical of the alleged weakness of Russia’s westernised representatives at Berlin. The settlement achieved there was deeply disliked by most of the imperial family and in court circles. There was a widespread feeling that Russia had been the victim of a conspiracy of the other great powers and that the fruits of her victory had been undeservedly reaped by Austria and Britain. On the other hand there were liberal newspapers such as the Vestnik Evropy and the Birzhovie Vedomosti which thought the San Stefano terms too extreme to be practicable and others such as the Golos which defended Gorchakov and Shuvalov against their critics. Shuvalov himself claimed that he had gained all the points laid down in his instructions and was particularly pleased by the inclusion of the Sanjak of Sofia in Bulgaria.” Milyutin, the ablest and perhaps the most powerful of the Russian ministers, thought the results of the war quite satisfactory. The carrying-out of the decisions made at Berlin took time and much diplomatic haggling. It was not until the end of September 1878 that Russian army headquarters were moved from San Stefano to Adrianople. The definitive Russo—Turkish peace treaty which replaced that of San Stefano was signed only on 8 February 1879. In the following month the British fleet repassed the Dardanelles; it had thus spent over a year in the Straits. The new autonomous regime in Eastern Rumelia was set up in May 1879. By early in August the Russian army, after a new series of Anglo—Russian wrangles, mainly over the extent of Turkish control in the Principality, had evacuated both it and Bulgaria. In the Balkans the results of the crisis of 1875-8 are clear. It brought to fruition, at least in the limited form of legal independence, the national feeling which had been fermenting for decades in Serbia and Rumania. It laid the foundations, through Russian victories and sacrifices, of another independent state in Bulgaria. By transferring Bosnia and Herzegovina to de facto Habsburg rule it sowed the seeds of the Austro—Serbian rivalry which, smothered and concealed for the next quarter-century, was to break out with devastating results after 1903.3 Nevertheless it did not meet all the demands of the Balkan nationalities. This was inevitable. ‘These

demands now conflicted violently with one another; in the nature of things they could never be completely satisfied. But the fragility of the 1878 settlement in the Balkans arose also from the fact that it had been designed to suit the convenience of the great powers, and above all of Austria and Britain. Its detailed application was therefore a painful process accompanied by bitter protests from the peoples and governments who thought themselves injured by it. In the politics of Europe the Congress of Berlin was also a turning-point. On this level the outstanding characteristic of the events of 1875-8 had been the lack of stable combinations and effective alliances between the great powers. Apart from the unwillingness of both Austria and Russia to alienate Germany, and Bismarck’s desire to keep on good terms with both, there were few fixed points of reference in the relations of the major states during these years. At Berlin there were no real groupings. None of the powers had a partner with which it was in agreement on all points. Austria and Britain worked well together in practice; but their interests were in many ways very different. Bismarck did not wish to alienate the Tsar; but he made no effort to help him defend the clauses of the San Stefano treaty to which both Britain and Austria objected. It was the tensions revealed by the great eastern crisis of the 1870s which ended this period of fluid great-power relations. On 7 October 1879 Bismarck signed with Andrassy, just before the latter’s resignation, the defensive Dual Alliance which was to endure for the lifetime of the German and Habsburg Empires. His motives will never be precisely known. He may have been influenced by the belief that such an alliance, with what was still thought of as in some sense a German state, would be popular in Germany. He may have feared the resentment which Germany’s attitude at Berlin and in the early months of 1879 had aroused in some circles in Russia, though this is very doubtful. He himself had done much to provoke this resentment, apparently deliberately, by measures which had nothing to do with the Near East, such as the new German customs tariff of 1879. Certainly he wished to prevent Austria becoming too friendly with Britain, as she seemed to be doing in 1878-g, and even perhaps with France, and thus resurrecting the ‘Crimean coalition’ of 1855-6. Even an informal combination of these three powers, such as had been seen in the year or more after the Congress of Berlin, could weaken and humiliate Russia so seriously as to threaten the balance of power in Europe. Whatever the precise reasons for Bismarck’s action, he would not have taken it but for the events of 1875-8 and above all the Austro—Russian antagonism which had emerged during these years.
218


THE EASTERN CRISIS 1879-81
On the foundation of the Dual Alliance was rapidly reared a structure of precise and binding international commitments such as Europe had not known since the fall of Napoleon I. During the winter of 1879-80 discussions between Bismarck and Saburov, the Russian ambassador in Berlin, paved the way for a renewal, in a strengthened form, of the Dretkaiserbund. Even more important, in April 1880 Gladstone replaced Beaconsfield as Prime Minister and thus brought about a dramatic change of policy in Britain.! His accession to power was followed by an immediate improvement in Anglo—Russian relations. For the next two years British policy aimed at the ending of tension with St. Petersburg and the construction of an effective concert of Europe. Austria-Hungary could no longer rely on British support against Russia, insofar as she had ever been able to do so. The result was that by June 1881 the Drezkaiserbund had been reconstituted. But its members were now linked by a formal treaty, not by the vague understandings and gentleman’s agreements of 1872-3. International relations were now more rigid than for two generations. It was the events of 1875-8 which had set this dangerous alliance-making process in motion.

CHAP TERVEIGHT
The Near East after the
Congress of Berlin
1878-96
THE years 1878-81 were dominated in the Near East by the problems which arose from the application of the decisions taken at Berlin — by the resistance to Habsburg rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina; by the question of the Greek and Montenegrin frontiers; and by the collapse of British efforts to reform the Ottoman Empire. The Habsburg occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, one of the most important results of the settlement, was fiercely attacked in both the Austrian and the Hungarian parliaments and was not ratified by the latter until March 1879. It was later still, on 21 April, that Abdul Hamid agreed to a convention which formally regulated the details of the occupation. Above all Habsburg rule was unwelcome to the inhabitants of the two provinces and encountered bitter armed resistance in 1878. It was not followed by the redistribution of land which had been hoped for by the Orthodox peasants.1 Though taxation was levied with greater fairness and efficiency than under the Turks, the Austrian administration was lax and corrupt. The introduction of conscription for the Austrian army stimulated a serious revolt in February-May 1882; and the restoration of order was not followed by any serious effort to deal with the social and economic grievances of the area. Though Bosnia and Herzegovina benefited materially from Habsburg rule in the two decades which followed, the Austrian regime never succeeded in putting down roots in the two provinces. The revolt of 1882, however, had little effect on international relations. By the resurrected Dreikaiserbund of June of that year the
1 Tt was only in 1905 that an effort was made to tackle the problem of land reform; and then by introducing changes in the system of taxation which had been suggested in 1878 by the last Turkish governor. (P. F. Sugar, The Industrialisation of Bosnia—Hercegovina, 1878-1918 (Seattle, 1963), p. 32.)

AFTER THE CONGRESS OF BERLIN 1878-82
contracting powers agreed to maintain neutrality if one of them became involved in war with a fourth power (except in the case of Turkey, where the obligation to remain neutral would apply only if there had been consultation beforehand). They also recognised ‘the European and mutually obligatory character’ of the existing regime of the Straits and thus safeguarded Russia against any British attempt to penetrate into the Black Sea. Austria promised not to oppose the union of the two Bulgarias, while Russia recognised Austria’s right to annex Bosnia and Herzegovina at some future date. Thus although the rebels in these two provinces aroused much Panslav sympathy in Russia the country’s official policy, now controlled by anew Foreign Minister of Swedish extraction, N. K. Giers, remained rigidly correct and unhelpful to them. Much more serious and intractable international problems were raised by the questions of the Montenegrin and Greek frontiers. The Catholic tribes of northern Albania strongly objected to being handed over to Montenegro, as the Berlin settlement had envisaged, and were supported in their attitude by the Turkish government.! Simultaneously it became clear that the revision of the TurkishGreek frontier, which the powers had entrusted to Greek and Turkish commissioners appointed for the purpose, would be much more difficult than had been expected. By August 1879 deadlock between the commissioners was complete. On both issues Abdul Hamid showed himself completely unco-operative, a master of delay, obstruction and evasion; while the fact that the great powers were not really united on either question gave him ample scope for his peculiar talents. He was thus able to oppose successfully the creation of an international commission to settle the question of the Greek frontier and also to stultify the work of a conference of ambassadors which met at Berlin in the last two weeks of June 1880 to discuss the same problem. Even the assembly at Ragusa on 14 September, after long negotiations, of a joint fleet of the great powers had at first little effect on him, while British proposals to coerce him by seizing Smyrna were opposed by Austria and France. However the Sultan, though obstinate, was also timid. The attitude of the British government frightened him; and by the end of October the Montenegrin question was well on the way to settlement. A month later the port of Dulcigno, the main point at issue, was in Montenegrin hands. The Greek frontier proved more difficult to establish. A French

221


1880-4 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 proposal at the end of 1880 for joint mediation by the great powers
was rejected by both the Greek and Turkish governments; and not
until late in March of the following year did Abdul Hamid put
forward proposals which formed the basis of a settlement. Moreover
in this case his delays and obstructions proved profitable. By the Greco-Turkish convention of 24 May 1881 the Greeks made considerable gains in Thessaly and Epirus; but they did not acquire Crete, the cession of which by Turkey had several times been mooted in the negotiations of the preceding two years. The Greek government was forced to accept this rather unfavourable settlement of its claims only by pressure from the great powers, most of which were now heartily sick of Balkan squabbles. Nevertheless it lasted for sixteen years — a respectable life-span for any territorial settlement in the peninsula during the later nineteenth century. Underlying these relatively unimportant problems and influencing the possible solutions to them were fundamental changes in the relations between the Ottoman Empire and the major European powers. Abdul Hamid, brought to the throne by the murder of his uncle and the deposition and imprisonment of his half-brother, was dominated throughout his long reign (1876-1909) by fears of conspiracy and revolt. Morbidly suspicious; buried in his palace; appearing in public as seldom as possible and then only heavily guarded by soldiers; at the mercy of courtiers, astrologers and police informers, he was not the man to provide the tottering empire with the leadership it required or to win the respect of foreign governments. He had the obstinacy of the timid man and a certain naive cunning, but little real intelligence. His reign saw considerable material improvements and innovations in his empire, particularly in the development of railways and telegraphs. A recent and expert writer has even claimed that ‘It would not be an exaggeration to say that it was in these early years of the reign of Abdiilhamid that the whole movement of the Tanzimat— of legal, administrative and educational reform — reached its fruition and its climax.’! But in politics (as distinct from administration or economic life) his regime was based on a complete refusal to contemplate reform and on a determination to use western technology, as far as possible, merely to prop up the inefficient despotism he had inherited. The fall of Midhat Pasha in February 1877 was followed by his exile to Crete, and thence to Damascus and Smyrna. This in turn was the prelude to his deportation to southern Arabia, where in 1884 he was quietly

strangled. The Turkish Parliament, the most important innovation produced by the constitution of 1876, was prorogued in February 1878, only a fortnight after the armistice with Russia had been signed, It did not meet again for thirty years, though the constitution remained formally in force and was printed every year in the official handbook of the Ottoman Empire. The summer of 1879 saw a notable growth of Moslem conservatism at the Porte and a definite rejection of nearly everything Midhat had symbolised. This tendency continued in the years which followed. Open political opposition to the Hamidian regime in the 1880s and 1890s was confined to small groups of exiles and refugees in western Europe. Within the Ottoman Empire political espionage and strict censorship of the press helped to reduce opponents to impotence (though it is fair to add that the Sultan was not, by twentieth-century standards, brutal in his methods of dealing with conspiracies against him). ‘At the present day’, wrote an acute though pessimistic commentator in 1900 after nearly a quarter of a century of rule by the Sultan, ‘most people with an adequate knowledge of the facts are probably agreed that it is useless to attempt to introduce reforms in Turkey (except in unobtrusive matters of detail) if they are to be executed by Turkish officials.’ More serious in many ways, Abdul Hamid did his best to reduce the influence and prestige of the great institutions which were the traditional props of the empire —the army and the ulema. These he regarded as possible threats to his power, so that the importance of the War Ministry was reduced, rival groups of officers were played off against each other (normally the Sultan favoured those of urban as against those of rural origin) and efforts to raise the quality of religious education were repressed. Even before the fall of the Conservative government in London in May 1880 some of its members had begun to despair of the continued existence of a state so governed. In particular Salisbury, to whom the regeneration of Turkey had never seemed likely, now hoped merely to delay its collapse until Britain’s diplomatic and strategic position in the Near East and India could be strengthened. In February he told Layard that ‘It would be of no little advantage to defer the fall of Turkey till our railway has been made to Candahar. It would be a great success to defer it till the revolution in Russia has taken place’.2 Moreover there had already been signs, as early as the winter of 1878-9, that Abdul Hamid was turning away from Britain and ceasing to rely on her support, mainly because of her refusal to

1880-2 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 give him a loan and her continuing insistence on reforms, and that
he might welcome an. understanding with Russia. Austria (who had
after all retained far more Turkish territory than Russia under the
Berlin settlement) was also losing infiuence at Constantinople. It is noteworthy that in 1878-9 Abdul Hamid fought harder to retain some degree of control in Bosnia than in Bulgaria. Anglo-Turkish relations deteriorated still more rapidly with the accession to power, after the election of March 1880, of the Liberal cabinet headed by Gladstone. The great Liberal leader accepted the necessity to maintain the Ottoman Empire, if only because its collapse would involve so great a threat to European peace; and he was always opposed to Russian possession of or dominance at Constantinople. But he loathed almost everything for which the Sultan stood. Between him and Abdul Hamid lay a gulf of mutual incomprehension and suspicion which proved quite unbridgeable and which rapidly widened. Layard had to confess that the Sultan felt ‘a kind of horror of Mr. Gladstone’, and the English statesman repaid the compliment by saying that ‘the mind of the Sultan, who is the Turkish government, is a bottomless pit of fraud and falsehood, and he will fulfil nothing except under force or the proximate threat of force’. The result of this growing disillusionment in Britain with the Sultan and his regime was a tendency to withdraw from the Near Eastern commitments which the Conservatives had undertaken in 1878-80. In February 1881 Goschen, Layard’s successor at Constantinopie, suggested that Cyprus, which he and many of the cabinet regarded as merely an expensive burden, should be evacuated; though fear of the possible reaction of public opinion if this were done led to the rejection of the proposal. A year later the government, faced by systematic obstruction from Constantinople of all proposals for reform in Asiatic Turkey and by the indifference to the question of the other great powers, decided to withdraw the military consuls established there only a year or two earlier. By then British pressure for reform had subsided into ineffective nagging, while in the same year the occupation of Egypt by British forces gave an entirely new twist to Anglo—Turkish relations and increased the Sultan’s hostility and distrust. The decline of British influence at the Porte meant, inevitably, a rise in the relative standing there of some of the other powers. In January 1882 Abdul Hamid made tentative advances to Germany and: Austria in the hope of securing an alliance with them. The idea was rejected in both Berlin and Vienna, since such an alliance might well undermine the Dreikaiserbund and involve serious friction with

The new balance of power at the Porte became clearly visible during the Penjdeh crisis of 1885. By defeating an Afghan force on the Afghan frontier at the end of March, Russia seemed to the British government and people to threaten the independence of Afghanistan and thus British power in India. In a Russo-British war, which for a moment seemed imminent, it was of great importance that the British fleet should be able to pass through the Straits to strike at south Russia or the Caucasus. Yet the Drezkaiserbund powers, at the request of Russia, had no difficulty in persuading the Sultan to
to keep the Straits closed and to prevent any application in practice of the British declaration of 11 July 1878. The Anglo—Russian
friction over the Afghan frontier was damped down, without
very great difficulty, by an agreement reached early in September;
but the position at Constantinople which Britain had now lost was
never to be regained.

1875-81 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
Empire is easy to understand, for this period saw Turkish sovereignty limited by the western powers in a hitherto unprecedented way by the establishment, in 1881, of international control of the Ottoman Public Debt. In October 1875 the Turkish government had defaulted on the interest payments in respect of its foreign debt. This had disastrous repercussions on the financial position of the empire, and in particular on its ability to borrow abroad. The Congress of Berlin had provided for the setting-up at Constantinople of an international commission of experts to study the claims of holders of Turkish government securities and to work out ways of meeting them. Disagreements between the holders of different issues of Turkish government bonds, however, made any quick solution of these questions impossible; and the financial position of the Turkish government became steadily worse. Finally in December 1881, by the Decree of Mouharrem, the Council of the Ottoman Debt, with seven members representing different groups of bondholders, was set up. A large part of the Turkish government revenue (the produce of the salt and tobacco monopolies, of the tribute paid by Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia, and of the taxes on stamps and spirits) was placed under its control and was to be used by it for the service and repayment of the debt. The terms of this settlement were not entirely unfavourable to the Ottoman Empire. The maximum amount which could be spent on interest payments and capital repayments in any one year was fixed; if the sources of revenue ceded to the Council yielded more than this the excess was to be repaid to the Turkish government. Any dispute between it and the Council was to be referred to arbitration. Above all the amount of the debt was written down from £191 million to £106 million; and it was anticipated that the normal rate of interest payable on this reduced sum would be a mere 1%. Moreover the Council administered efficiently the revenues under its control and only a very few of its employees were imported from western Europe. Nevertheless the settlement was, at least by implication, a humiliating confession of inferiority and incapacity on the part of what had been one of the greatest powers of Europe. Losses of territory by the empire could be borne, especially if the areas in question had no large Turkish element in their population; but the debt settlement of 1881 seemed to threaten the end of Turkish sovereignty even in Constantinople and Asia Minor. Already in 1879 Lord Derby had complained that ‘the daily surveillance of which Turkey is the object in her domestic affairs has reduced her sovereign authority to practically zero’.1 The Decree of Mouharrem had made the position, from the Turkish point of view, much worse. 1.

AFTER THE CONGRESS OF BERLIN 1878-81
For several years after the solution of the Greek boundary problem in 1881 the politics of the Near East were dominated by the parallel though essentially unrelated questions of Bulgaria and Egypt. Were Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia, separated at Berlin, to be reunited; and were they, united or not, to be dominated by Russia? How were financial collapse and political revolution to be staved off in Egypt? Would Britain occupy the country permanently, and if she did what would the attitude of the other powers be? Of the two problems that of Bulgaria was the more dangerous; it helped to provoke, in 1887, the most serious international crisis of the period. That of Egypt, however, was the more prolonged, the more intractable and in many ways the more important. It appeared in 1878 and for several years afterwards that Russian predominance in Bulgaria was assured. The country had been liberated from Turkish rule by Russian arms and by the shedding of Russian blood. At San Stefano, Russia had shown that she regarded the interests of the Bulgarians as outweighing those of any other Balkan people.' In spite of the partition which Bulgaria was made to suffer it was almost universally assumed that Russian influence would continue to predominate there. For several years this assumption seemed justified. In November 1878 the proposals for a new Bulgarian constitution drawn up by General Dondukov-Korsakoy, the Russian commissioner there, were amended in St. Petersburg in a decidedly liberal direction, so that the Bulgarians were given a number of rights not yet possessed by the Russians themselves. The constitution finally approved in April 1879 by a Bulgarian national assembly meeting at Tirnovo was thus relatively liberal. Moreover Prince Alexander of Battenberg, who was accepted as Prince of Bulgaria by the assembly the day after the constitution had been approved, seemed on the surface amenable to Russian influence. He was related to the Russian royal family; he had been an officer in the Russian army; and he was poor and therefore likely to be dependent on Russia for financial support. When in May 1881 he overthrew the Tirnovo constitution and increased his personal power his action was supported both by Alexander III and by the Russian military representative in Bulgaria, General Ernroth, who was appointed head of the newly-formed provisional government. Nevertheless the seeds of a serious Russo—Bulgarian conflict had
1 During the negotiations for the treaty Giers told the Serbian representative in St. Petersburg that ‘the interests of Russia come first, then those of Bulgaria, and only after them come Serbia’s’; but that there were occasions on which ‘Bulgarian interests stand on an equal footing with the Russian’.

1879-82 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
already been sown. Alexander of Battenberg despised the Russians,
largely because of the military inefficiency they had shown in
1877-8, and was in his turn distrusted by Panslavs such as Aksakov
because of his German descent. He resented the predominance of
Russia in Bulgaria (particularly in the army, in which Russians held
all ranks from that of captain upwards) and complained that “all the
scum of Russia has taken refuge here and has tainted the whole
country’.! Moreover the position of Russia in Bulgaria was already
being weakened by a factor which was to operate with disastrous
effects for years to come — her failure to evolve any consistent policy
towards her new protégé and the complete lack of co-operation between her agents there. Almost from the moment of his arrival in Bulgaria, Alexander of Battenberg was on bad terms with MajorGeneral Parensov, the Russian who acted as his War Minister, while on the other hand the Russian Consul-General in Sofia, Davydov, encouraged the Prince in his demands for increased personal power. This division between the Russian representatives on the spot was paralleled by one in St. Petersburg. There Giers tended to agree with the attitude taken by Davydov; but he lacked the ability, and perhaps the will, to make his point of view prevail.? Milyutin, the ablest and most powerful of the ministers, supported Parensov in wishing to use the army and the liberal political groups rather than the Prince as the basis of Russian power in Bulgaria. Under these circumstances a clear and consistent Russian policy was hardly to be expected and was never evolved. Other sources of Russo—Bulgarian friction soon arose. The Russian government hoped that the Bulgarians might build a railway from the Danube to Sofia, or even down to the valley of the river Maritsa. A line of this kind would allow Russia, if necessary, to move an army relatively quickly to within striking distance of Constantinople. But it would have little economic value to Bulgaria, which had in any case agreed, by the treaty of Berlin, to build a line through her territory linking Nish, Sofia and Constantinople. This obligation was
in itselfa burdensome one, and it is not surprising that the Bulgarians
were unwilling to saddle themselves in addition with the heavy and relatively unproductive expense of a Danube railway.3 1 Thid., p. 49.

AFTER THE CONGRESS OF BERLIN 1882-5 More serious was the resentment aroused by continuous Russian interference in Bulgarian politics. In May 1882 the Russian ConsulGeneral Khitrovo, Davydov’s successor, was recalled because of his intrigues against Prince Alexander with the Bulgarian liberals and various discontented army officers. This was followed by the appointment by the Prince of two Russian generals as his chief ‘ ministers, in an effort to end the governmental instability which had hitherto been a marked feature of Bulgarian political life. General Sobolev became head of the government, and also Minister of the Interior, while General Kaulbars became Minister for War. From March 1883 onwards their control of the Bulgarian government was virtually complete. This regime was a failure. Sobolev was determined to foster and protect Russian interests (though there is no evidence that any of his policies were directly inspired by the Russian government) and his arrogance made him very unpopular with many Bulgarians. Both he and Kaulbars wished to make an alliance with the liberals and restore constitutional government in Bulgaria, thus limiting the powers of Alexander of Battenberg. In this they had the support of the Tsar, whose personal dislike of the Prince was now growing rapidly; and they achieved their objective. When the Assembly met in September 1883 it almost at once demanded the restoration of the Tirnovo constitution, and to this Prince Alexander had to agree. However Sobolov and Kaulbars were now thoroughly disliked by both liberals and conservatives and were forced to resign. Finally in November, after a fruitless effort to assert his personal control of the army, Alexander of Battenberg had to agree that the Tsar should henceforth have the right to nominate the Bulgarian War Minister. The next eighteen months saw some easing of the tension between the Prince and the Russian government; but by the summer of 1885 Alexander of Battenberg’s desire to marry the Princess Victoria of Prussia, the granddaughter of William I and Queen Victoria, was once more arousing bad feeling in St. Petersburg. There was never the slightest chance of the marriage taking place. Bismarck, who wished above all to maintain good relations with Russia, opposed it firmly and even brutally. But Alexander’s wish to ally himself in this way with the German ruling family, and above all with that of Britain, Russia’s greatest opponent, seemed to many Russians to mark him out as unworthy to rule a Slav people for whose independence so much Russian blood had been shed. In August 1885 the Russian representative in Bulgaria, Koiander, even suggested a Russian occupation of the country on the lines of those already carried out by Austria in Bosnia-Herzegovina, by France in Tunis, and by Britain in Egypt.
229


1878-85 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 Nevertheless the last months of the year were to see Alexander of Battenberg win a series of quite unexpected successes. The partition of Bulgaria in 1878 had been deeply resented both in the new autonomous principality and in Eastern Rumelia; and it was widely assumed that a reassertion of national unity could not be long delayed. The Dreikaiserbund agreement of 1881 envisaged such a union, to be brought about ‘by force of circumstances’. Moreover the course of events in Eastern Rumelia since the Congress of Berlin had in many respects run parallel to that in Bulgaria proper. An international commission had drawn up an impractical and elaborate Organic Statute for the province in the spring of 1879 (the equivalent of the Tirnovo constitution in Bulgaria). Aleko Pasha, the first Governor-General of the province, had been antagonised like Alexander of Battenberg by Russian demands for a dominant influence there and in particular for control of the armed forces. By 1884, therefore, when it secured his dismissal by the Porte, the Russian government had decided that the union of the Bulgarias, which it had struggled to produce in 1878, was no longer desirable from the Russian point of view. Bulgarian nationalism, however, was not prepared to be restrained in this way. On 18 September 1885 a revolt broke out in Plovdiv (Philippopolis), the capital of Eastern Rumelia, in favour of the union of the province with Bulgaria. It met no resistance; and Alexander of Battenberg was at once faced with the problem of whether to accept the union or not. His position was difficult. He had known nothing of the preparations for the revolt, and as recently as August had assured Giers that no trouble was to be expected in Eastern Rumelia in the immediate future. He was well aware that Alexander III would not welcome a union of the two Bulgarias under the rule of a man he now regarded as an enemy. Moreover none of the great powers welcomed the union of Bulgaria, largely because they feared that the revolt in Eastern Rumelia might spread to Macedonia and involve Greek, Serb or even Rumanian intervention, with unforeseeable consequences.! An informal conference of ambassadors held at Constantinople in November to discuss the new development produced no result. Salisbury, now Prime Minister, had decided that a personal union of Eastern Rumelia and Bulgaria would do little harm to British interests and would not add much to the existing weakness of Turkey ;? but the Drezkaiserbund

AFTER THE CONGRESS OF BERLIN 1881-5
powers, under the influence of Russia, stood firm against any recognition of the union. On the other hand, if Alexander of Battenberg refused to lead the movement for union he had no hope of retaining his position in Bulgaria. Stefan Stambulov, who had been the leading figure in the revolt in Eastern Rumelia and who was to be a dominant one in Bulgarian politics for the next decade, made this quite clear. ‘Sire,’ he said to the Prince, ‘the union is made — the revolt is an accomplished fact, past recall, and the time for hesitation is gone by. Two roads lie before Your Highness: the one to Philippopolis and as much further as God may lead; the other to Sistoff (Sistova), the Danube and Darmstadt. I counsel you to take the crown the nation offers you.”? Alexander of Battenberg accepted his advice; but in doing so he increased still further the dislike, now almost hatred, felt for him by the Tsar. On 21 September Alexander III ordered the recall of all Russian officers serving in the Bulgarian army. On the goth he told a deputation from the Bulgarian Assembly that the country could expect no help from Russia as long as Alexander of Battenberg remained in power. These were serious blows to Bulgaria, partly because of the possibility that the Turks might occupy Eastern Rumelia and try to restore the autonomous regime there and still more because of the growing likelihood ofa Serbian attack. With Bosnia and Herzegovina now under Habsburg rule Serbia could expand only to the south-east, towards Macedonia. Moreover the position of her ruler, Prince Milan, was extremely insecure. Unlike the overwhelming majority of his subjects he was hostile to Russia; and on 28 June 1881 he signed with Austria-Hungary a secret agreement which made Serbia virtually a Habsburg protectorate. It provided for the prevention by Serbia of anti-Austrian activities of any kind on her territory, for each of the two states to maintain friendly neutrality if the other were at: war with one or more other states, for a possible military convention between them and for Austrian support for territorial gains by Serbia on her southern frontier. The chief Serbian ministers, Pirochanats and Garashanin, objected above all to Article VI of the agreement, by which Serbia bound herself to make no political understanding with any other state and to admit no foreign armed forces to her territory. However Milan accepted it on 24 October, in spite of their opposition, in a private letter to the Austrian government. As opposition to
way they were entitled to do by the Berlin settlement; nor had they fortified the frontier along the Balkan mountains which British statesmen had fought so hard to secure for them in 1878. 1 Jelavich, op. cit., pp. 216-17.
231


1882-6 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
his policies grew in the years which followed (in 1883 he had to dismiss all the Serb bishops because of their hostile attitude) the Prince’s hatred of Russia and dependence on the Habsburgs increased. Count Khevenhiiller, the Austrian minister in Belgrade, became one of the dominant figures in Serbian politics. Milan’s effort to bolster up his sagging prestige by assuming the title of King in March 1882 had little result; and almost from the moment of the rising in Eastern Rumelia he began to demand ‘compensation’ for the accession of strength which union would give Bulgaria and her ruler. These demands he supported by threats of war. On 14 November, apparently encouraged by Khevenhiiller, who was pursuing a private policy at variance with that of his government, he launched an attack on Bulgarian territory. Early Serbian successes were followed by a most unexpected Bulgarian victory at Slivnitza on the 16th-19th November and by the Bulgarian occupation of such important Serbian towns as Nish and Pirot. Milan’s aggression had been unpopular with the Serbs, above all with the liberal and radical political groups, and his position was now desperate. Austria was forced to intervene in defence of her protégé. On the 28th Khevenhiiller delivered at the headquarters of Alexander of Battenberg a virtual ultimatum. If the war went on Austrian troops would intervene in defence of Serbia and, he threatened, Russia would occupy Bulgaria. In acting in this way he went further than Kalnoky, the Austrian Foreign Minister, had authorised him to do. But he produced the desired effect. The Bulgarian advance was halted; and on 3 March 1886 Serbia and Bulgaria made peace and restored the prewar position between them. It seemed therefore that the position of Alexander of Battenberg was now secure, especially when, in February 1886, the Porte accepted him as Governor-General of Eastern Rumelia and agreed to reappoint him to the position at five-year intervals. In fact, however, his difficulties had grown no less; they had merely changed their form. Russian hostility to him was now greater than ever; and the fall in February 1886 of the short-lived Conservative cabinet headed by Lord Salisbury deprived him of one of his few outside sources of support. Salisbury, after some initial hesitations, had been willing to welcome a personal union under Alexander of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia, each of which might retain its own institutions. Gladstone, who succeeded him as Prime Minister, was less willing to involve Britain in the affairs of Bulgaria; and his accession to power completed the diplomatic isolation of the Prince. Meanwhile economic difficulties and a growing feeling that nothing more than a personal union of the two Bulgarias was possible while he
232


AFTER THE CONGRESS OF BERLIN 1886 remained on the throne were making Alexander’s position in Sofia more and more difficult. The Russian government was now organising a conspiracy against him, using Colonel Sakharov, its military attaché in Sofia, for the purpose; several members of the Bulgarian cabinet, including even the Minister-President, Karavelov, seem to have been implicated in it. On 21 August, the conspirators seized Alexander in his own palace and forced him to abdicate. Two days later he left the country. The loyalty he had inspired proved greater than had been thought in St. Petersburg. Stambulov began to form at Plovdiv a government favourable to him: the provisional regime set up in Sofia by the conspirators soon collapsed. On 29 August, only eleven days after his abdication, Alexander was able to return to Bulgaria. He was now, however, understandably weary of the incessant difficulties with which he had had to cope during the last seven years. He also feared, with some justification, that he might be assassinated if he attempted to retain the throne, or that there might even be a Russian military occupation of Bulgaria. Moreover at the very moment of his return he antagonised much Bulgarian opinion by a last desperate effort at reconciliation with the Tsar. ‘As Russia gave me my crown,’ he wrote to Alexander III, ‘I am prepared to give it back into the hands of its sovereign.’ The implications of these words were too much for many Bulgarians to stomach; and on 9 September, after making sure the Russian government would recognise the regency to be set up after his departure, he left Bulgaria for the last time. His departure did not end Russo—Bulgarian disagreements. The Russian military attaché in Vienna, who now arrived in Sofia as chief representative of his country, proved as arrogant and overbearing as Sobolev three or four years earlier. When the Assembly elected Prince Waldemar of Denmark, the brother-in-law of the Tsar, as the new ruler of Bulgaria, Alexander III refused to allow him to accept the offer. Finally on 18 November, after an attack a week earlier in Plovdiv on the courier of the Russian consulate there, diplomatic relations between Russia and Bulgaria were broken off. Bulgarian affairs were now helping to produce a serious international crisis. Even before the abdication of Alexander of Battenberg there had been vague suggestions of some Anglo—Austrian combination to check Russian influence in the Balkans, though the unwillingness of either of the states concerned to take the initiative and thus risk becoming the tool of the other prevented this having any result. Both in London and Vienna opinion was divided on the policy to be
233


1886 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
followed towards Russia. Kalnéky knew well that Bismarck would
never support Austria in any direct and open challenge to Russian influence in Bulgaria. On the other hand the Hungarians, whose influence over the policies of the Habsburg Monarchy was becoming steadily greater as the century drew to a close, had cherished a grudge against Russia ever since 1849 and intensely disliked any growth of her power in the Balkans. Their resentment of what was felt to be the pro-Russian attitude of the German government might seriously threaten the Dual Alliance of 1879. In London divisions of opinion were less deep but no less real. It was now clear to Salisbury, who had returned to power in August 1886, that a united Bulgaria might be an effective barrier in the way of a Russian advance towards Constantinople. ‘Convinced that Turkey was dead, he was prepared to use a lively Bulgaria to guard the corpse.’ But some members of his cabinet, such as Lord Randolph Churchill and W. H. Smith, though they supported Bulgarian independence were unwilling to see Britain involve herself deeply in opposition to Russia in the Near East. They wished rather to concentrate on the defence of British interests in Persia and central Asia. On 13 November Kalnéky, under Hungarian pressure, announced that a Russian occupation of Bulgaria ‘would be a violation of the treaties which, in our opinion, is not admissible’. This produced violent reactions in Russia and the Russian ambassador in Berlin even remarked that ‘it is absolutely necessary that we should make Austria disappear from the map of Europe’. All this bad feeling made Bismarck’s position very difficult. He was alarmed by the growth of aggressive nationalism and anti-German feeling in France which was now becoming visible and which was making increasingly attractive to many German military leaders — for example General Bronsart von Schellendorff, the War Minister, and General von Waldersee, the Quartermaster-General — the idea of a preventive war with the French. He was also worried by unmistakable signs that some sectors of Russian opinion, influenced by M. N. Katkov, the greatest of all Russian journalists, were becoming ready to throw over the Dreikaiserbund and make an agreement with France. Bismarck was (as essentially he always had been) completely pessimistic about the possibility of removing the ultimate sources of international conflict; but he knew Germany had nothing to gain from a war and wished to extricate his country, and Europe, peacefully from this threatening situation. He therefore did his best to hold the balance between his allies, though he allowed the Russians to

AFTER THE CONGRESS OF BERLIN 1887
know that he would, in the last resort, support an occupation of Bulgaria by them if they felt it to be essential. By the beginning of 1887 the position was becoming still more dangerous. General Boulanger, the War Minister who had become the symbol of French national feeling and desire for revenge for the defeat of 1870-1, was at the height of his popularity. The newspapers were whipping up fear and distrust in both France and Germany. Bismarck used the crisis with great skill, and perhaps made it seem more acute than it really was, in order to obtain a majority favourable to him in the Reichstag elections held on 21 February. But the threat to peace, which in January and February seemed so imminent to many journalists, was always at bottom rather unreal. No government wished to start an international conflict. Even in France Boulanger’s civilian colleagues disapproved of his antics, while it is doubtful if there was any real popular desire, at least outside Paris, for a second round with Germany. All Frenchmen desired the recovery of Alsace and Lorraine. Aggressive war against Germany, with all its unpredictable consequences, was another matter. In this Franco—German tension the Bulgarian question played no part. But in other ways its indirect influence on European politics was great. Alexander III, disillusioned by events in Bulgaria, was completely unwilling to remain allied to Austria-Hungary which now stood forth more clearly than ever as Russia’s main rival in the Balkans. He had no intention of concluding the agreement with France, for which some Frenchmen were already hoping; but the Dreikaiserbund was clearly on its last legs. In June 1887, when the treaty concluded three years earlier expired, it was not renewed. The result was that Bismarck, seeing the position of Germany and Austria-Hungary weakened by the growing coldness of Russia, attempted to find alternative sources of support for them. In February he had already forced the Austrian government to renew, on terms much more favourable to Italy, the Triple Alliance of 1882. The treaty, which was about to expire, was renewed for five years; but additional Italo—Austrian and Italo-German agreements were also signed. By the former Italy and Austria agreed that if the status quo in the Balkans had to be disturbed they would occupy territory there only by mutual agreement and on the principle of mutual compensation. By the latter a war between Italy and France caused by French colonial expansion in North Africa was admitted as a casus foederis under the treaty of 1882. These agreements constituted the most important international recognition hitherto given of Italy’s right,
in certain circumstances, to expand in the Balkans and North Africa.
I 235


1887 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
Almost simultaneously she was being strengthened from a
different direction. Great Britain wished to buttress her own position
in the Mediterranean against Russia, and still more against France
where resentment over the position in Egypt was now acute and where Boulangism was an anti-British almost as much as an antiGerman movement. She was therefore willing to make advances to Italy. Bismarck, hoping to secure British support for the Triple Alliance and to induce Britain to take the lead in opposing Russian influence in the Balkans, encouraged this tendency. He urged in particular that an Anglo-Italian understanding would tend to strengthen Austria and make her more able to take, if necessary, a strong line against Russia in the Balkans; and this argument made some impression on Salisbury. Thus by an exchange of somewhat vaguely worded notes on 12 February 1887 Italy and Great Britain promised each other to support the status quo in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea and to ensure that if changes in it became necessary they should be made only after previous agreement between them. Six weeks later Austria adhered to this understanding. By the spring of 1887, therefore, France found her freedom of diplomatic action increasingly restricted. The likelihood of her launching a war of revenge against Germany, never as great as it appeared on the surface, was also diminishing. With the fall in May of the cabinet of which Boulanger was a member it declined sharply. Moreover by March it was clear that the nationalist and Panslav influences in Russian political life, symbolised above all by Katkov, which were generally favourable to France and distrustful of Germany, had been defeated in their efforts to control the policies of Alexander III. Already in January Schweinitz, the German ambassador to Russia, had written in his diary that ‘everything is returning to the position which existed in 1878-79’. General Obruchev, the Russian Chief of Staff, though he was not proGerman, hoped for an alliance with Germany which would allow Russia to declare war on Great Britain, her supreme enemy. Giers, a conservative unsympathetic to Panslav idealism, retained great influence over Russian foreign policy. He failed to persuade Alexander III to renew the Drezkaiserbund; but in May he was able to open negotiations for a separate Russo—German agreement designed, from the Russian point of view, mainly to safeguard the position in
Bulgaria and at the Straits.

alliance of 1879, promised to support Austria if she were attacked by Russia. Finally a compromise was arrived at by which Germany was not obliged to remain neutral in case of a Russian attack on Austria or Russia in that of a German attack on France. Germany recognised the legitimacy of Russia’s ‘preponderant and decisive influence’ in Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia, while both powers recognised ‘the European and mutually obligatory character of the closure of the Straits of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles’ and promised to compel Turkey to observe this rule strictly. By a secret protocol Germany agreed not to permit the restoration of Alexander of Battenberg and to observe benevolent neutrality if Russia found herself compelled to seize the Straits. The treaty made it almost inconceivable that Russia should support a French attack on Germany, and this constituted its great merit in Bismarck’s eyes; but as many historians have argued it was hard to reconcile, in spirit if not in the letter, with the Dual Alliance of 1879. Also it was clear from the beginning that neither of its signatories gave it whole-hearted support. Though Giers was satisfied with its terms the Tsar was more doubtful; and the German government insisted on its being valid for a period of only three years rather than the five proposed by the Russians. Early in July, after it had become clear that Alexander of Battenberg would not return, the Bulgarian Assembly elected as their Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg. It was hoped that, as a grandson of Louis-Philippe, he might adapt himself easily to the position of a constitutional monarch; but in some ways he was not a good choice. His sincere Catholicism divided him from the majority of his subjects and he lacked the genuine if sometimes misguided concern for the welfare of his people which Alexander of Battenberg had shown. Above all he was certain to be opposed by the Russian government, which had hoped to set up a regency under a candidate of its own, the Russian General Ernroth, and which was further antagonised by the fact that Ferdinand until his election had been an officer in the Austrian army.! In August 1887 it seemed for a time that Russia might send a force to Varna and establish a regency by a coup de main. Most observers in western Europe, justifiably cynical about the stability of Balkan regimes, thought Ferdinand’s fall unlikely to be long delayed; and few governments were willing to recognise him as ruler of Bulgaria. In spite of this unpromising start to his reign he was to remain on the throne for over thirty years. His position was considerably though
1 Whether he was encouraged by the Austrian government to accept the offer of the Bulgarian throne is still uncertain.

1887-8 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 indirectly strengthened by the second Mediterranean Agreement of 12-16 December 1887 between Britain, Italy and Austria. This, like that between the same powers nine months earlier, consisted merely of an exchange of notes. It was kept secret at Salisbury’s insistence because of the opposition he feared in Parliament if it were revealed. By it the three states agreed to maintain the status quo in the Near East, and in particular to oppose any cession or delegation by Turkey to any other power of her rights of suzerainty in Bulgaria or her sovereign rights in Asia Minor. If she connived at encroachments on her rights or territory (for example by granting Russia a special position at the Straits) the three powers might provisionally occupy parts of her territory ‘to secure the objects determined by previous treaties’. This agreement was a much more serious obstacle to the extension of Russian power than that of March had been. Unlike its predecessor, it was intended specifically to deal with the position in the Near East, not with the Mediterranean as a whole. More important still, it was strongly supported by Bismarck. When, on 3 February 1888, the terms of the Dual Alliance of 1879 were published (mainly as a result of repeated questions in the Hungarian Parliament as to its scope) it became clear to all educated Russians that an attack on Austria, without which Russian control of Bulgaria could scarcely be re-established, would mean war with Germany. Russian efforts to dominate Bulgaria had thus ended in defeat. Giers, with German support, succeeded in forcing the Turks on 6 March to declare illegal the rule of Ferdinand of Saxe—Coburg; but this was a mere gesture. Britain, Italy and Austria were unwilling to see Ferdinand overthrown, especially as there was no knowing who or what might succeed him. The Turkish declaration thus marks the end of the Bulgarian crisis, though it was several years before Russian hostility to Ferdinand could be appeased. The intricate series of events in Bulgaria in 1879-86 had very important repercussion on the policies and interrelations of the great European states. It forced Britain to undertake commitments towards other European powers, partly at least in pursuance of her policy of resistance to Russia in the Near East. It increased the alienation from Russia of the leading personalities of Bulgarian politics and the feeling in Russia that the Bulgarians and perhaps all the Slav peoples of the Balkans were ungrateful and untrustworthy. As early as September 1885 Alexander III told General Obruchev that in the Near East only the question of Constantinople and the Straits was of real importance to Russia and that ‘everything else that takes place in the Balkan Peninsula is secondary for us. There has been enough propaganda to the detriment of the true interests

of Russia. The Slavs must now serve us and not we them’. In April
of the following year Jomini, a high Foreign Ministry official,
suggested to Giers that Russian policy in the Balkans should hence
forth be based on patronage of the Greeks, who were ‘more
intelligent and more consistent’ than the Slavs. In St. Petersburg
considerations of power politics and national interests had now overcome the confused but genuine idealism which had always been one ingredient in the Panslav movement. The alienation of Russia and Bulgaria was completed when in 1891 a group of Bulgarian refugees who had taken refuge in Russia attempted, with the help of Russian officials, to murder Stambulov and succeeded in killing Belchev, the Minister of Finance. Not till 1896, when Ferdinand had his son Boris, already christened as a Catholic, received into the Orthodox church, did the Russian government begin to modify its hostility to him. Much more important, all Bismarck’s manceuvres in 1886-7 failed to prevent a serious deterioration in Russo—German relations. In September 1886 Malet, the British ambassador at Berlin, had told the Foreign Secretary, Lord Iddesleigh, that ‘Notwithstanding an apparent parade of frankness, Prince Bismarck’s policy is decidedly dual, an open and an outspoken one, which maintains the alliance with Russia at all hazards, and a hidden and silent one, which derives satisfaction from every rebuff which Russia receives’.? This estimate of the position was quite correct. In Russia ill will towards Germany was increasingly felt in ruling circles and more and more openly expressed by considerable sections of the press. In June and July 1887 autocratic Russia and the French republic co-operated diplomatically for the first time when they forced the Porte to abandon the Drummond—Wolff Convention on Egypt which it had just signed with Great Britain.’ This joint action by Russia and France was a great nuisance to Britain; to Germany, if it were allowed to develop further, it might become a very serious threat. In July a German government decree (the exact reasons for its issue are still somewhat obscure) forbade the Reichsbank to accept Russian government bonds as security for loans. This decree both symbolised and increased the underlying tension which was now unmistakably present in Russo—German relations; and at the end of the month Moltke, the German Chief of Staff, proposed
nothing less than an Austro—German attack on Russia. In Vienna,
almost simultaneously, the Archduke Albrecht drew up a plan for an
Austro—German offensive against Russia in the following spring.
These alarms had no practical result. Bismarck was completely 1 Jelavich, op. cit., p. 236. 2 Smith, op. cit., p. 61. 3 See p. 250.

1850s—1879 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 opposed to a preventive war against Russia and there is no evidence that the Russians had the slightest intention of attacking Austria as the soldiers in both Berlin and Vienna feared. But in December 1888 the first of a long series of Russian government loans was floated in Paris; and in January 1889 the Russian government placed in France a large order for new rifles for its army. Events in Bulgaria had laid part of the foundations for the Russo—French alliance which was slowly brought into existence in 1891-4.
The internal difficulties of Egypt, which became very acute from the mid-1870s onwards and which led to the British occupation of 1882 and all its attendant complications, arose from the country’s inability to withstand the ‘informal expansion’ of Britain and France to which it had been subjected for the last half-century. From the 1850s these foreign influences became more and more dominant in most aspects of Egyptian life, as the strong government and statecontrolled economy which Mohammed Ali had struggled to create crumbled in the hands of his weaker and more liberal successors. By the later 1850s foreigners were settling in Egypt at a rate of about 30,000 a year; in 1865 no less than 80,000 arrived. The Khedive Said (1854-63) granted many concessions to European investors and adventurers (above all of course that for the building of the Suez Canal). His reign, though in many ways a period of rapid economic advance for Egypt, saw also a growth of sharp practice by some of the Europeans concern—edfor example in the presentation of excessive or unjustified claims for compensation when foreign merchants or concesstonaires suffered loss of any kind, and in the misuse of extraterritorial rights by foreigners. This had serious implications for the future. More ominous still, Said began in 1858 to issue bearer bonds as a means of raising mone —ya great step towards the creation of the public debt which was to decide the country’s fate two decades later. Under his successor Ismail (1863-79) government indebtedness increased at a rate probably unequalled in any other country in the nineteenth century to the crushing figure of £91 million. Many of the loans Ismail contracted were raised on ruinous terms. For example that of £32 million obtained in 1873 through the Oppenheim banking firm brought only £11 million in cash into the Egyptian treasury since it had to be floated at a heavy discount and large commissions paid to its promoters. Ismail borrowed, in part at least, to develop the productive resources of Egypt; and modern students familiar with the good as well as the bad effects of deficit financing may well judge him less harshly than his Victorian contemporaries did. Nevertheless by the

1870s a collapse of some kind was clearly approaching. The suspen
sion of payments on the Turkish foreign debt in October 1875 led
to a loss of confidence by investors in Oriental securities of all kinds; and the Egyptian government followed its suzerain into partial bankruptcy? in April 1876. By the early months of that year the Khedive’s credit was so bad that he could raise new loans only by offering 30%, interest; in 1877 about £74 million out of a total government revenue of £94 million was spent on the service of the debt. Moreover tribute still had to be paid to the Porte; and the Egyptian government had agreed to pay Britain till 1894 an annual sum equivalent to 5°% of the purchase price of the Suez Canal shares bought by Disraeli in November 1875. This meant that in the later 1870s only about £1 million a year (not much more than a tenth of its revenues) was really at the disposal of the government. In 1875 and early 1876 an important French financial organisation, the Crédit Foncier, had begun to urge that Egypt’s finances must be placed under European control. By February of the latter year Ismail foresaw that he might soon find himself in a position resembling that of the Bey of Tunis, who was now little more than a French puppet. Intervention in defence of the very large foreign financial interests in Egypt was now inevitable. Early in May 1876, as part of an effort to place the country’s finances on a more secure footing, the Caisse de la Dette Publique was set up. This body, under four foreign controllers, British, French, Italian and Austrian, was to control the service of the debt, to which the Egyptian customs duties, the profits of the railway system, the yield of the excise on tobacco and some other sources of revenue were assigned. Six months later it was agreed that two Controllers-General of the Egyptian Finances should be appointed by the Khedive on the recommendation of the British and French governments and should work in co-operation with the high officials of the Caisse. Once the principle of foreign intervention in Egypt had been admitted the incompetence and increasing helplessness of the Egyptian government gave scope for its rapid expansion. In August 1878, after an international commission of enquiry into the country’s finances had presented its report, Ismail was forced to form a cabinet headed by an Armenian, Nubar Pasha, with an Englishman as Minister of Finance and a Frenchman as Minister of Public Works. When in April 1879 the Khedive tried to replace it by a
native Egyptian cabinet under Sherif Pasha, to draw up a new constitution and to reduce the rate of interest on the debt, the British

1866-81 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 and French governments ‘recommended’ him to abdicate and secured his deposition by the Sultan on 26 July. A year later under his weaker son and successor, Tewfik, and after another international commission had reported on the Egyptian finances, the Law of Liquidation was issued. This in effect separated the Debt budget from that of the country in general and gave the former priority. A maximum amount for the administrative expenses of Egypt was specified. If the government’s revenues exceeded this figure it was regarded as having a budgetary surplus on which the Cazsse might make claims for the reduction of the debt, irrespective of what the real expenditure of the government was. The officials of the Cazsse could, by contrast, draw upon the country’s administrative revenues, if necessary, to make up deficits in the debt budget.! As was later said, under these conditions Egypt was financially ‘tied hand and foot, unable to move, almost to breathe, without the consent of Europe’.? Nevertheless the law stabilised the country’s finances to a degree unknown for many years. Egypt’s political difficulties, however, were now becoming more and more acute. In 1866 Ismail had convened, for the first time in Egyptian history, a Chamber of Deputies. This soon became the mouthpiece of Egyptian national feeling, a role which by the later 1870s had been taken over by the National Society. The rapid evolution in Egypt during that decade of political journalism of a modern kind provided a more effective and lasting vehicle for such feeling; and the journalist Abdullah al-Nadim, who had become very influential by 1877 or 1878, can be regarded as the first Egyptian popular nationalist. Besides, however, these national and racial emotions (which were directed against the Turks even more than the Europeans) there were other factors making for political instability. Fanatical Moslems were opposed to the growing Christian influences in the country. Landowners wished to preserve their fiscal privileges, threatened by modernisation and financial developments. Above all there was widespread discontent in the army, the higher ranks of which were almost monopolised by Turks and Circassians. One of the more obvious ways in which the government could economise was by reducing the salaries of army officers; and Nubar Pasha’s efforts to put 2,500 officers on half-pay were the main reason for the fall in the spring of 1879 of the cabinet which he led. By 1881 it was clear that a very serious crisis was imminent. The War Minister, Osman Rifki Pasha, was a Circassian and bitterly

unpopular with the Egyptian officers who found themselves sub
ordinate to him. Early in the year Tewfik was forced to dismiss him;
with this surrender discipline in the army rapidly collapsed. In September a coup d’état led by Arabi Pasha, a discontented army officer of native Egyptian origins, forced the dismissal of the Prime Minister, Riaz Pasha. The Khedive had now become little more than the puppet of the nationalist soldiers. The European powers, and above all Britain and France whose interests in Egypt were predominant,! thus found themselves faced with a situation in which military action on a large scale might be needed to protect the interests and even the lives of their nationals. Hitherto the two powers had co-operated fairly effectively in Egypt, neither showing much desire to assume political responsibilities there. In October 1876 Disraeli had dismissed any idea of a British occupation as ‘moonshine’.? A year later General Gordon, soon to acquire in the Sudan a reputation unique in the history of British colonial expansion, wrote that ‘it would be downright madness to go and incur obligations of such a nature as the capture or annexation of Egypt would bring on us’.? In April 1877 a proposal by Nubar Pasha that a British protectorate be established in Egypt was unhesitatingly refused by the government. By the end of 1881, however, there were signs that harmonious Anglo-French co-operation might not be so easy to achieve in future. The British cabinet, in which non-interventionist influences led by Gladstone, the Prime Minister, were still strong, was unprepared for anything more than diplomatic action. It insisted that if military intervention in Egypt became necessary it should be undertaken by the country’s Turkish suzerain. The French government, on the other hand, distrusted Abdul Hamid’s growing Panislamic ambitions and was opposed to strengthening Turkey’s tenuous hold on Egypt. However Gambetta, the Prime Minister, was anxious to co-operate with Britain. On 8 January 1882, therefore, in spite of some reluctance on the part of Gladstone, the two governments in identical notes presented to the Khedive proclaimed that they would support him and maintain the existing system of financial control. These notes produced a violent

in Egypt; but it was never strong enough to have a really important influence on events there. }

1882 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 reaction in Egypt and led to the formation there, on 5 February, ofa
strongly nationalist government with Arabi as Minister for War. The fall of Gambetta’s cabinet on 26 January 1882 temporarily lessened French pressure for intervention; but on 15 May the British and French governments announced that they were sending naval squadrons to Alexandria to maintain order and support the Khedive. This naval demonstration was a failure. Tewfik dismissed his nationalist ministers on 25 May but had to accept their return to power only a day or two later. Clearly his throne was now tottering; and an international conference on the Egyptian problem which opened at Constantinople on 23 June achieved nothing, mainly because of the obstruction and procrastination of Abdul Hamid who at first refused to send any Turkish representative to its meetings. Even before the conference began the position had changed decisively for the worse. On 11-12 June the mob of Alexandria, angered and alarmed by the appearance of the British and French warships, murdered about forty Europeans in the streets. This greatly increased the likelihood of some drastic action by Britain and France. In particular it strengthened the elements in the British cabinet, led by the Marquess of Hartington, which wanted a forward policy in Egypt and were prepared to act there, if necessary, without help from France. This introduced a very important new element into the situation. Hitherto the French had made the running in Egypt and pressed for action there: the British government, preoccupied above all by the acutely difficult situation in Ireland,! had merely kept in step from a desire to prevent French influence dominating the country. Henceforth there was at least a possibility of independent action by Britain; and by early July there were widespread suspicions in London that the French government was preparing to make a separate agreement with Arabi and his followers. On 3 July Admiral Seymour, the commander of the British squadron at Alexandria, was ordered by the cabinet to prevent further work by the Egyptians on the fortifications of the city. A few days later he presented to the Egyptian authorities an ultimatum in which, exceeding his instructions, he demanded the surrender of the forts in question and not merely the ending of work on them. Its

A failure to give this factor full weight underlies the very severe criticisms which have been made by some historians (e.g. W. L. Langer, European Alliances and Alignments, (New York, 1950), p. 277) of the actions of the Gladstone cabinet.

rejection was followed by a British bombardment of the city on the
11th. The Gladstone cabinet (which had agreed only with great
difficulty on the sending of any ultimatum at all by Seymour) had thus, almost unconsciously, embarked on an occupation of Egypt whose responsibilities it would have to shoulder alone. The French government had refused to take any part in the bombardment. It argued, reasonably enough, that it would merely endanger the Europeans at Alexandria unless it could be combined with the landing of troops in the city; and also that France could not make war on Egypt without the authorisation of the Chamber of Deputies. Moreover on the 6th the Constantinople conference had invited the Turkish government to intervene in Egypt and restore order there, though few observers had much faith in the ability of the Porte to achieve this satisfactorily. (It was not in fact until the 19th that the Sultan even agreed to Turkey being represented at the meetings of the conference.) It soon became clear that, contrary to the hopes of some British ministers, the Egyptian nationalists would not collapse in face of a mere naval bombardment of one seaport. They were now in control of the country and able if they wished to make a serious attack on the Suez Canal. For several days (18-22 July) there was acute disagreement in the British cabinet on the course to be followed. Gladstone himself, supported by Harcourt, the Home Secretary, wished merely to protect the Suez Canal and to co-operate with the French in doing so. An Anglo-French declaration by which the two powers announced their readiness to defend the canal was in fact issued on 24 July. On the other hand Hartington, now backed by Dilke, the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, and by Joseph Chamberlain, the President of the Board of Trade, wished to complete what had been begun by the bombardment of Alexandria and to crush the Egyptian nationalists completely. Gladstone’s influence over his colleagues was decreasing, largely because it seemed that he might soon retire and be succeeded by Harcourt, and it was therefore decided to send a force to Malta and Cyprus for use in Egypt if necessary. In August this force, led by General Wolseley, landed ai Alexandria. On 13 September it destroyed at Tel-el-Kebir an Egyptian army led by Arabi. A British domination of Egypt which was to last for forty years had begun. It had been established without plan or forethought as the result of a series of almost fortuitous responses to initiatives taken by the
French and the Egyptian nationalists. Not until 10 August did
Gladstone suggest that ‘the time might be close at hand when . . . we
might . . . set forth the character, intentions and limits of our action
245


1882 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 in Egypt’.! More important still, it was established in the end by the action of Britain alone, without French co-operation or support. On 23 July Freycinet, the French Prime Minister, made it clear that any intervention by France in Egypt would be limited to the defence of the Suez Canal; and when six days later he asked the Chamber of Deputies to vote money for a expedition with this limited objective he was overwhelmingly defeated and forced to resign. He was a man of less energy and much less personal magnetism than his predecessor Gambetta, less interested in Egypt and less anxious for co-operation with Great Britain; but even Gambetta could not have won a majority in the Chamber for joint Franco—British action in Egypt. To most Frenchmen the Suez Canal and trade with Egypt hardly seemed a vital national interest; and the nationalist movement there appeared to threaten only the interests of the French holders of Egyptian securities.2 Above all heavy involvement in Egypt might distract French energies and attention from the Rhine and from the recovery of Alsace—Lorraine, the one objective of foreign policy for which there was truly national support in France. This consideration was decisive in the vote of 29 July. ‘Europe is covered with soldiers,’ said Clemenceau at the end of his speech during the debate, ‘everyone is waiting, all the powers are reserving their freedom of action for the future; keep France’s hands free also.’? But however unwilling Frenchmen might be to commit their country in Egypt they were bitterly resentful of the predominance Britain now seemed to be acquiring there. France had a tradition of interest and activity in Egypt, dating from the Crusades, which Britain could not match. Since the time of Mohammed Ali French officers, teachers, technicians and professional men had made a contribution to the development of the country unequalled by those of all the rest of Europe combined. The dominant position in Egypt’s cultural life and the very important one in its economic life which history had given France seemed on the point of being snatched away, and by an already envied and far too successful rival. A sullen ill will towards Britain, a desire to force her out of Egypt by making difficulties for her there, was henceforth to be a dominant influence in French policy in the Near East. Britain’s position in Egypt was therefore uneasy, complex and

obscure. France was clearly becoming more and more hostile. Italy, the other European power with both large interests in Egypt and the means of intervening there, had given Britain no support.! Abdul Hamid, alarmed and humiliated by a foreign occupation of what was still in theory Turkish territory, felt himself more than ever justified in his dislike of Gladstone and the Liberals. Moreover, what was Britain’s legal status, if any, in Egypt? What exactly was she to do there? How long were her forces to remain? To these questions British statesmen had now to work out the answers, largely by a process of trial and error. The one thing on which they all agreed was that the occupation would not last long. In September 1882, within a few days of Tel-el-Kebir, the government was drawing up a time-table for the evacuation of the British forces. In August 1883 it was announced that the garrison of Cairo would be withdrawn to Alexandria and that the force to be maintained in the latter would be a mere 3,000 men. In March 1884 Harcourt wrote that ‘We must get out of Egypt as soon as possible at any price.”? For several years to come the idea of an early evacuation continued to attract British politicians. Yet side by side with a sincere desire to leave Egypt as quickly as possible went a determination not to surrender the dominant influence there which Britain had now acquired. Events were to show that the two aims were irreconcilable and that the former, -perhaps inevitably, would be sacrificed to the latter. On 3 January 1883 the British government, in a circular note to the powers, formally claimed for Britain a leading position in Egypt. If this were recognised by them and if freedom of navigation in the Suez Canal were guaranteed Britain would withdraw her forces. There was never any real chance, however, of the states of Europe, above all France and Turkey, giving Britain satisfactory guarantees on the first of these points. Moreover the influence she had acquired would be nullified if Egypt reverted to chaos when the British forces left. Willingness to evacuate, therefore, was dependent not merely on the attitude of the other great powers but also on the establishment of an Egyptian government which was efficient, stable and to some extent pro-British. Such a government was not easy to create. The decision taken at the end of 1883 to abandon the Sudan to the

Mahdi! and his followers was wise in itself; but it was intensely unpopular in Egypt, where it caused the resignation of the cabinet and even created a possibility that the Khedive might abdicate. This position threw increasing power and responsibility into the hands of the small group of British officials there, notably into those of the ConsulGeneral in Cairo, Evelyn Baring; so that by 2 April 1884 Gladstone could say, with regret but with substantial truth, ‘We have done our Egyptian business and we are an Egyptian government.” By the later 1880s Egyptian politics centred on the relations between three competing groups — Cromer and his officials, the Khedive and his conservative supporters and, midway between them, growing nationalist forces largely in the tradition of European liberalism. The British regime had by then become ‘a veiled Protectorate of uncertain extent and indefinite duration for the accomplishment of a difficult and distant object’.? From the international point of view Britain’s position in Egypt was vulnerable above all on the financial side. As the dominant power there she now had at least de facto responsibility for the country’s economic position. To carry out the improvements it urgently needed she must either reduce the interest-payments on Egypt’s foreign debt (which would be opposed by the bondholders, above all by the French) or herself shoulder the cost of the British occupation forces there (which would be unpopular with the British taxpayer). The former of these courses proved exceptionally difficult to follow. In the spring of 1884 long Anglo—French negotiations resulted in an undertaking by the British government to evacuate Egypt in three and a half years time if by then the country were sufficiently stable. Jules Ferry, the French Prime Minister, agreed on his side that France should not occupy the country after the British forces left and that she should join in an international guarantee of its neutrality rather along the lines of that given to Belgium in 1830. But this tentative agreement was made in preparation for an international conference on the Egyptian question called by Britain, which was to meet at the end of June, and was dependent on French agreement to the financial proposals which the British government then intended to put forward. When the conference assembled, the pressure of the Chamber of Deputies and of the French holders of Egyptian bonds forced Ferry to reject all the British

AFTER THE CONGRESS OF BERLIN 1885
proposals for reducing Egypt’s debt burden. None of the other powers represented supported Britain and the conference broke up without achieving anything. It was now clear that Britain had assumed in Egypt in a very haphazard and unplanned way responsibilities which she could not abandon without severe damage to her prestige and perhaps her interests. Yet neither could she continue to shoulder them without, as Hartington complained, suffering ‘all the evils of becoming a Continental State’.1 Some escape from this position through an agreement with France thus continued to be sought. In March 1885, by the London Convention, the two governments agreed that the debt administration should remain essentially unchanged and that the foreign loan of which the Egyptian government was in urgent need should be an international one guaranteed by all the major European powers (not, as Hartington and the Earl of Northbrook, the First Lord of the Admiralty, would have preferred, a purely British one). These were large concessions to the French point of view. In return the French government agreed that any surplus produced by the Egyptian revenues allocated to the service of the debt should be at the disposal of the Egyptian government for administrative purposes. The later 1880s and early 1890s saw in fact significant improvement in Egypt’s financial position as a result of British administration;? but they also saw the chance of a political settlement there become more remote than ever. The acute international tension of 1885-7, which has been described above, increased greatly, from the British point of view, the desirability of some understanding with France. In case of an Anglo—Russian war over Bulgaria or, more probably, over some trivial frontier dispute in central Asia, it was extremely important to ensure French neutrality. Without it a British squadron helping to protect the Straits against Russian attack might find itself threatened from the rear by the French squadron based on Toulon; and Britain might even lose control of the Mediterranean. Thus in August 1885 Sir Henry Drummond-Wolff was sent on a special mission to Constantinople in an effort to persuade the Porte, as suzerain of Egypt, to take over some of Britain’s burdens there and to grant her terms on which she could withdraw from the country. Britain might for example, Salisbury suggested, be given partial control of the Egyptian railways

1885-7 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 and the right to reoccupy Alexandria if she considered this necessary for the defence of her interests. On 24 September, Drummond-Wolff signed with the Turkish government a preliminary convention by which British and Turkish commissioners were to be sent to Egypt to supervise the reform of its army and administration. Once this had been satisfactorily achieved discussion of the withdrawal of the British forces could begin. Drummond-Wolff himself, as the British commissioner, spent most of 1886 in Egypt without accomplishing much; but with his return to Constantinople in January 1887 serious Anglo—-Turkish negotiations began and on 22 May an Anglo—Turkish convention was signed. By this the British government agreed to withdraw its forces from Egypt within three years unless this should be prevented by some serious external or internal danger to the country. In return she extracted large concessions from the Porte. She was to have an indefinite right to re-enter the country if it were threatened by invasion or domestic disorder. (The Porte was to have a similar right; but it was assumed that it would never be able to make use of it.) Her withdrawal was to be accompanied by an international guarantee of Egyptian neutrality. The evacuation of her forces was not to begin until these conditions had been accepted by the other powers. This agreement was violently opposed by the French government, since it postponed the British evacuation for three years, seemed to regularise Britain’s position in Egypt and would give her, even after her forces had been withdrawn, a special status there. In this attitude France was supported by Russia— the first tangible sign of the slowly and painfully growing tendency for the two states to come together (as yet in opposition to Britain far more than to Germany). Montebello and Nelidov, the French and Russian ambassadors at Constantinople, went so far as to threaten the Sultan and his ministers with war if the convention were ratified. Abdul Hamid could not hold out against this pressure. On 19 July 1887 Drummond-Wolff left Constantinople without the Turkish ratification. It was clear that the British government, and notably Salisbury, would not sacrifice Britain’s special position in Egypt merely to lessen the obstacles faced by British diplomacy in Europe. Moreover the acute crisis of early 1887 was now over. Already signs were visible of that loss of interest in Near Eastern affairs and increased attention to the Far East which were to mark Russian policy for nearly two decades to come. This considerably lessened the risk of a direct Anglo—Russian collision and thus made it easier for Britain to resist French pressure and ‘sit still and drift awhile’ in Egypt. Also
250


AFTER THE CONGRESS OF BERLIN 1888-98 the British regime there still enjoyed, as it had done on the whole
from its beginnings, a degree of German diplomatic support which was often very important. By the end of the 1880s, therefore, it was being increasingly widely accepted in London, and willy-nilly in the other European capitals, that there was no prospect of an early end to the British occupation. The Suez Canal Convention signed at Constantinople on 29 October 1888 did something to quiet the fears of the maritime states of Europe by proclaiming complete freedom of passage for all shipping, in peace and war, through the canal.? One result was that when, in June 1889, the French government offered in effect to accept the Drummond-Wolff Convention, Salisbury felt able to propose quite unacceptable conditions. Suggestions for a British withdrawal put forward by the Turkish government in April and June 1890 with French and Russian support also failed, as did semi-serious Anglo—Turkish negotiations on the subject in August 1894. For five years after the landing at Alexandria every British government had sincerely desired to leave Egypt if this could be done without sacrificing British influence there. Now only a few unimportant radical groups envisaged an early abandonment of the country on any terms. By the 1890s Britain’s difficulties in Egypt arose mainly from the opposition she was encountering within the country — from the sullen resentment of the new Khedive, Abbas II, and the conservatives, from the rise of national feeling and above all from the lack of any truly Egyptian ruling class through which the British administration could work. By comparison the diplomatic harassment to which the occupation had exposed her in the 1880s was clearly less acute. By 1898, when the Sudan had been reconquered from the Khalifa, the successor of the Mahdi, and his followers, there was even a widespread belief in Cairo that the proclamation of a British protectorate was imminent. Events in Bulgaria had modified the attitude of the Russian government to Near Eastern affairs. Those in Egypt had even more influence on the attitude of Great Britain. Control of this new acquisition, and in particular the ability to use Alexandria as a naval base, strengthened the feeling already visible in some governing circles in Britain in the 1880s that the protection of the Straits against Russian attack was no longer a necessity. Britain now

1891-6 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
seemed to have acquired in the eastern Mediterranean a strategic position, based on her control of Egypt and to a lesser extent on that of Cyprus, which she could maintain by her own efforts even if the Ottoman Empire collapsed. In any case, was she still in a position to defend the Straits effectively against Russian attack? In the 1880s it had become clear that she could not do so without support from some of the other great powers — Austria—Hungary, Italy, above all Germany — and it was impossible to ensure that this support would always be forthcoming. The 1890s saw her position at the Straits become even weaker. In August 1891 France and Russia agreed to act in concert if peace were threatened; a year later they signed a military convention, though it did not receive the formal approval of Alexander III and the French government till January 1894. A Franco—Russian alliance had thus come into existence; German political domination of Europe, insofar as it had ever existed during the Bismarckian period, was now at an end. The repercussions of this on Britain’s naval position in the Mediterranean were potentially very serious. In 1891 the Directors of Naval and Military Intelligence, in a report approved by the Lords of the Admiralty, argued that Britain could not now defend Constantinople against Russian attack, since this would mean concentrating a large part of the country’s naval strength in the eastern Mediterranean and thus risking the escape of the French Toulon squadron into the English Channel. Effective British protection of the Turkish capital was possible only if France were Britain’s ally, ‘which is of course an absurd hypothesis’, or if the French fleet had first been destroyed. “The presence of the French fleet, therefore, in the harbour of Toulon’, they concluded, ‘without any declaration of hostile intention or any hostile act, has the power of entirely immobilising, and therefore neutralising, any force that we possess or could bring under existing circumstances into the Mediterranean.’! The report, which shocked Salisbury, was perhaps unduly pessimistic. But its conclusions were echoed in other memoranda of 1892 and 1896; there could be no doubt that Britain’s naval position in the Mediterranean had been markedly weakened. Moreover in the 1880s Abdul Hamid, with the help of German engineers, had greatly improved the fortifications of the Dardanelles. The new forts, in the hands ofa hostile Turkey or a Russian expeditionary force, would make it much more difficult than ever before to pass a British fleet through the Straits. One result of this position was a sharp rise in the British naval

By the end of the nineteenth century there were about a million Armenians under Turkish rule. They formed important colonies in Constantinople and a few other cities; but the great majority of them were scattered widely over eastern Asia Minor and mingled with Turks and Kurds so that no vilayet? of the Ottoman Empire had an Armenian majority. They were therefore a minority in their own homeland, and a badly oppressed minority. Because of their religion it was almost impossible for them to secure justice from the Turkish courts; and they were subject to savagely discriminatory taxation (above all to the much-resented kishlak, or winterage tax, which allowed Kurdish nomads to claim winter quarters in Armenian homes, paying in return a sum of money to the Turkish governors or military commanders of the areas concerned). Until the second half of the nineteenth century the Armenians had remained remarkably quiescent under Turkish oppression ;but from the 1850s onwards the influence of educational work (largely by American missionaries) in the Armenian areas, and of the increasing number of young Armenians educated in western Europe, was helping to produce a growth of national feeling and political ambitions. ‘Yesterday,’ wrote an Armenian in 1872 in a Tiflis newspaper, ‘we were an ecclesiastical community; tomorrow we shall be a nation of workers

the War (London, 1926-38), vi. 780.
2 The vilayets were large administrative divisions, each embracing several of
the old provinces. In 1864 the empire had been divided between twenty-seven of them.

1890-4 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 and thinkers.’ An Armenian delegation was sent to Berlin in 1878,
though its request for the appointment of a Christian GovernorGeneral for the partly Armenian areas of Asia Minor, and for other concessions, met with no response. The British government made several efforts in the years after the Congress to secure better treatment for the Armenians. But these, backed by only half-hearted support from Russia and none from any other power, had petered out by 1881. By 1890, when the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (Dashnagtzoutiun) was formed at Tiflis, in Russian Armenia, relations between Armenians and Turks were becoming very strained. “The Armenian is no longer imploring,’ it proclaimed in 1891, ‘he now demands, with gun in hand.® The radicalism of the Dashnagtzoutiun, and of the more extreme Hentchak group which had been formed by emigrés in Geneva in 1887 and was considerably influenced by Marxist ideas, was not shared by many Armenians, especially the more wealthy ones. Nevertheless the fears and suspicions of Abdul Hamid, always so easily aroused, were now becoming acute. II] treatment and even massacres of Armenians were increasing; and in 1891 the Porte began the creation of irregular units, the Hamidiyeh regiments, which were composed mainly of Kurds and intended for use against Armenian unrest. Large-scale slaughter of Armenians in the Sassun district in the early autumn of 1894 produced a violent anti-Turkish reaction in Great Britain and to some extent in France. Early in May 1895, therefore, Britain, France and Russia, after long and difficult negotiations, presented to the Porte a very limited scheme of administrative reform to be applied in the vilayets of eastern Anatolia. This effort to protect the Armenians was doomed from the start by disagreements between Britain and Russia. The Russian government had a large number of Armenian subjects of its own; and from about 1883 onwards they, like the other non-Russian peoples of the empire, had been subjected to increasing efforts to russify them and destroy their national consciousness. Autonomy for the Turkish Armenians, or even any marked improvement in their position, would certainly make the absorption of the Armenians on Russian territory more difficult. They were therefore most unwelcome to the Russian government. As early as September 1890 Giers had assured the German attaché at St. Petersburg that Russia had no desire to create a second Bulgaria in the form of an autonomous Armenian principality. More

over the association of Armenian nationalism with social and political radicalism seemed to mark it still more clearly as a potential danger to the Russian Empire; in June 1895 the government in St. Petersburg made it clear that it would not use force to carry out reforms in Anatolia. France could not disregard the attitude of her ally. She needed Russia as a weapon against Germany and Great Britain more than Russia needed her; and Prince Lobanov—Rostovskii, who had succeeded Giers as Foreign Minister in 1894, was able to exert great personal influence over Hanotaux, his French counterpart. The result was that Britain’s efforts to help the Armenians, for the most part sincere and even idealistic, were given little support by the other great powers. The Russian government opposed in particular the creation of an international supervisory commission to ensure the effective application of reforms in the Armenian areas. Yet it was clear that without somebody of this kind to goad them to action the Turks would do nothing effective. Although the Porte issued a scheme of reforms on 20 October it was merely another of the paper promises of improvement which littered Turkish history in the nineteenth century. The winter of 1895-6 saw massacres of Armenians far worse than any hitherto known. The growing disturbances in the Armenian vilayets seemed to many contemporaries to show that the long-awaited final collapse of the Ottoman Empire was imminent. In Russia a number of statesmen and military leaders were now thinking in terms of a partition, which would involve an agreement of some kind with Britain. Salisbury’s mind was working along the same lines; and in July 1895 in an interview with Hatzfeldt, the German ambassador in London, he suggested that a partition of the empire might be necessary and sketched the lines which it might take. In particular he suggested that Italy might have Tripoli and Albania as her share. Hatzfeldt thought that this initiative from London for some Anglo-German understanding on the future of the Near East should be seriously considered. But Britain was distrusted in Berlin and Baron von Holstein, the Foreign Office official whose influence over German policy was then at its height, was against the proposal. Britain he believed, with much justification, must soon come into very serious conflict with France and Russia outside Europe, in Africa and the Far East. Salisbury might therefore be trying to create a diversion in the Near East and to involve Germany (and her allies Austria and Italy) in fighting Britain’s battles there. Such a bait must be refused. It was in Germany’s interest to keep Russia
occupied in the Far East and on bad terms with Britain and Japan
there, not to divert her energies back to Europe as a partition of

1895 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 the Ottoman Empire would certainly do. Moreover Austria would probably oppose an Italian acquisition of Albania. In another interview with Hatzfeldt early in August Salisbury may (though the balance of the evidence is heavily against the supposition) have offered to allow Russia to take Constantinople and the Straits in any future partition of the Ottoman Empire,’ and on the 5th of that month he had an interview at Cowes with William II, then on a visit to Great Britain. Whether during that interview Salisbury proposed a partition or whether (as he implied in the following year) the initiative in this respect came from the Emperor, is still uncertain. At all events no agreement was reached; and when Hatzfeldt was ordered to reopen the question Salisbury showed himself unwilling to discuss it. The whole episode had shown, none the less, the extent of the change since 1877-8 in Britain’s attitude to the Near East. As the seriousness of the Armenian massacres of 1895-6 became clear Salisbury played with various ideas for putting pressure on the Sultan to stop them. In particular he briefly contemplated an occupation of Jeddah, the main Turkish Red Sea port. Italy and Austria both showed some willingness to support a British initiative of this kind; and on 12 November, Goluchowski, the Austrian Foreign Minister, who was a Pole and therefore tended to be anti-Russian, suggested that the powers might be driven jointly to force the Dardanelles and compel Abdul Hamid to behave better. Russia was strongly opposed to such a plan; it seemed to open up unpleasant possibilities of an international control of the Straits which might deprive her for ever of the chance of dominating them. Nelidov, the ambitious and rather unrealistic Russian ambassador in Constantinople, had already suggested unsuccessfully, in 1882 and 1892, a forcible seizure of the Bosphorus by Russia; in the autumn of 1895 he repeated the suggestion, in spite of the fact that the Russian Black Sea squadron was still too weak for such an attempt to have any chance of success. Moreover Russia’s refusal to co-operate in putting
1 Hatzfeldt (whose despatches have till recently been the main source of information) reported that such an offer had been made; but he seldom reproduced Salisbury’s own words in his correspondence with Berlin and usually gave rather his own impression of what the Prime Minister really had in mind. Salisbury himself always denied having made such a proposal; and at the time of this conversation he was assuring Count Deym, the Austrian ambassador, that it was still Britain’s policy to maintain the Ottoman Empire and to keep the Russians out of Constantinople. By the autumn Hatzfeldt had come to believe that his first impression had been mistaken and that Salisbury had not meant the Russians to have Constantinople. The most recent discussion of the Anglo-German negotiations of 1895 is to be found in J. A. S. Grenville, Lord Salisbury and Foreign Policy (London, 1964), pp. 31-43.

pressure on the Sultan was supported by France, though on 20
December the French government made it clear that it would not back a forcible seizure of the Bosphorus by Russia. It was also clear that there was powerful opposition within the British government to committing Britain more deeply at the Straits. In November Salisbury failed to persuade the cabinet to empower Sir Philip Currie, the British ambassador at Constantinople, to summon the British fleet on his own authority if Russia seemed about to attack the Bosphorus. The proposal was opposed by several members of the cabinet and above all by the Admiralty which feared that the fleet, once it had entered the Straits, might find its communications with Britain and Egypt cut by France’s Toulon squadron. The Franco-Russian alliance had made it impossible to give Currie the powers granted to Ponsonby in 1834, Stratford de Redcliffe in 1853 and Layard in 1878. With affairs in this indeterminate position the winter of 1895-6 drew to an end. The sufferings of the Armenians had not ended, however. Violence against them continued and bred further violence. On 26 August 1896, in the most spectacular episode of the whole wretched business, a group of Armenians seized the Ottoman Bank in Galata, a suburb of Constantinople, and held it for several hours in an effort to arouse the interest of Europe in the sufferings of their people. The immediate result was a massacre of Armenians in the Turkish capital; and there seemed for a time a real danger of a British fleet forcing the Dardanelles and compelling the Porte to mend its ways. Salisbury felt that Abdul Hamid should be deposed (this was also the reaction of William II to the massacre) and at the end of September, in two interviews at Balmoral with Nicholas II, tried to secure Russian support for the idea. He did not, however, offer the Tsar any concessions over the Straits to secure his support, as has usually been thought.! Whether or not he had been willing in August 1895 to see Russia in possession of Constantinople he had abandoned the idea a year later. By 1896 his policy was based even more than in the past on good relations with Austria, the one European power which could be regarded as a friend of Britain; concessions of this kind to Russia seemed to him a betrayal of the Habsburg Empire.” The Balmoral interview had no result. On 20 October Salisbury issued a

1896-7 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
circular proposing that the powers agree to impose on Turkey by
force a programme of reforms acceptable to all of them, and secured
from Russia a somewhat vaguely worded agreement. But this, the
last real effort to do anything for the Armenians, petered out in February 1897 after interminable discussions in Constantinople. The possibility of British action against Turkey had already provoked Nelidov, in a despatch of 18 September 1896 to Shishkin, the Deputy-Minister for Foreign Affairs (Lobanov-Rsotovskii had died suddenly at the end of August) to demand once more forcible intervention by Russia. Two months later he arrived in St. Petersburg and on 30 November drew up a plan, the most serious hitherto produced, for a Russian seizure of the Bosphorus. Underlying this was the realisation that any growth of international control over the Ottoman Empire such as Salisbury’s proposals seemed to imply would be hostile to Russia’s interests. It would reduce her potentially dominant influence at Constantinople to that of one power only among a group of six, and might well replace the weak government of Abdul Hamid by a more efficient one less amenable to Russian pressure. If European intervention seemed imminent, he therefore argued, Russia must forestall it and safeguard her essential interests by acquiring physical control of the Bosphorus. A Crown Council held at Tsarskoe Selo on 5 December accepted the essentials of Nelidov’s argument; though Witte, the very able Minister of Finance, opposed a seizure of the Bosphorus as too dangerous and too likely to lead to a general war. It agreed that if, to force the Sultan to implement a programme of reform, foreign warships entered the Dardanelles, Russia should seize the Bosphorus. Nelidov was empowered to summon the Black Sea squadron for this purpose if he thought it essential: he was also simultaneously to offer the Sultan a guarantee of his personal safety if he co-operated with Russia. There was, however, little danger of this decision being applied in practice. French support was essential to Russia if she were to achieve any real agreement with Britain in the Near East, whether in the form of a partition of the Ottoman Empire or otherwise. French money also was increasingly necessary for the development of the Russian army and the realisation of the country’s great Far Eastern ambitions; and France, partly because of her great investments there, was resolutely in favour of the preservation of the status quo in the Near East. ‘Make no mistake about it,’ said Hanotaux to Mohrenheim, the Russian ambassador in Paris, on 30 December, ‘France will never consider herself committed to fight with Russia if war should break out in the Black Sea or the Straits.” Documents Diplomatiques Frangais, 1871-1914 1st series, xiii. 100.
258


AFTER THE CONGRESS OF BERLIN 1896-8 French unwillingness to support Russian ambitions at the Straits was a decisive obstacle to the carrying-out of Nelidov’s plan. Only a few days after the meeting of 5 December the Russian government agreed to three points laid down by Hanotaux: the maintenance of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire; a renunciation of the idea of separate action by any power against it; and at the same time opposition to any international condominium there. This agreement clearly robbed the decisions taken on the 5th of most of their force, and on the 20th Nelidov was told that they ‘had no relation to the existing position’.1 The diplomatic activity of 1895-6 in the Near East thus produced remarkably little concrete result. Nothing effective was done to help the Armenians. No agreement was made either for the partition of the Ottoman Empire or for the establishment of some form of international control over it. Russia was neither willing to forget her old rivalries and antagonisms with Britain nor able to act independently. Salisbury for his part was now ceasing to believe that it would be possible permanently to prevent Russia from seizing the Straits, though he hoped that the issue might not arise in an acute form until the Ottoman Empire had finally collapsed. On 20 January 1897 he finally refused to resurrect the Mediterranean entente of ten years earlier with Italy and Austria, as Goluchowski had been pressing him to do over the last year. The defence of Constantinople, he said, was now ‘an antiquated standpoint’. He continued to regard some rapprochement with Russia as very desirable and in January 1898 unsuccessfully offered her a very far-reaching ‘partition of influence’ in China and the Ottoman Empire.? From the beginning of 1897 onwards, however, he felt increasingly that Britain should withdraw from all responsibilities at Constantinople and concentrate on the defence and development of Egypt, which he now increasingly regarded as the key to the Eastern Question.
The two decades which followed the Congress of Berlin thus saw the solution, though in a quite unforeseen way, of the great problem of Bulgaria; and for the time being at least of that of Egypt. They saw Russia suffer in the former one of the most humiliating and unexpected political defeats in her history. They saw Britain strengthen enormously her position in the Near East, acquiring in

Egypt new resources and new problems; they also witnessed the almost complete abandonment by her of her traditional Turcophil policy and a very drastic change in her attitude to the Straits and Russian ambitions there. By the later 1890s, with Bulgaria and Egypt no longer acute sources of conflict and with the Straits question, though still unsolved, rapidly changing its character, the affairs of the Near East were beginning to revolve around other and in many ways less important issues — those of Crete, Macedonia and the Baghdad Railway.

1896-1909
THE years 1896-7 were in several ways a turning-point in the history of the Eastern Question. The decision then taken by Salisbury and his colleagues to base Britain’s defence of her Near Eastern interests on her position in Egypt rather than on efforts to preserve the status quo at the Straits was never reversed. For the next twenty years the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles, on which during the last two generations so much of Britain’s foreign policy had pivoted, played a secondary role in the thinking of her governments. Russia for her part, under the influence of ministers like Count Witte and publicists like Prince Ukhtomskii, was to look for nearly a decade to the Far East, to Manchuria, Mongolia, Korea and North China, as the natural field for her economic and territorial expansion. By comparison the opportunities open to her in the Near East seemed limited and difficult to exploit effectively. Francis Joseph and Goluchowski had been greatly alarmed in 1895-6 by the possibility of some violent initiative by Russia and were disappointed by the obvious tendency of Britain to withdraw from her traditional commitments in the Near East. Moreover the acute internal difficulties of the Habsburg Empire made some temporary stabilisation of the position in the Balkans seem very desirable. When they visited St. Petersburg at the end of April 1897, therefore, they were able to reach with surprising ease an arrangement with Russia to maintain the status quo in the Near East. On 5 May 1897 the two governments agreed not to disturb the existing position in the Balkans and to oppose any effort by any other power to do so. They also agreed that the question of Constantinople and the Straits had ‘an eminently European character’ and could not be the subject of a separate agreement between them; though the Russian government declared that it could admit no threat to the
261


1897 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
closure of the Dardanelles and the Bosphorus and Austria recognised
the ‘perfect legitimacy’ of this attitude. Even this step towards
increased stability in the area, however, was accompanied by strong
hints of future changes. Goluchowski, in a note of 8 May to Prince
Liechtenstein, the Austrian ambassador at St. Petersburg, proposed that the right of Austria-Hungary to annex at some future date Bosnia—Herzegovina and the Sanjak of Novibazar should be recognised by Russia; that an independent Albanian state should eventually be formed; and that the rest of the Balkans should in due course be divided equitably between the small states which already ruled so much of the peninsula, none of them becoming predominant. Count Muraviev, his incompetent Russian opposite number, gave a non-committal reply to these proposals and was clearly very unwilling to agree to the first. Nevertheless for the next six years the statesmen of Europe were able, if not to forget the Near East, at least to escape from that intense concern with its problems which had so often been their lot in the past. But real peace and stability in the area were further away than ever. Even before the signature of the Austro—Russian agreement a crisis had been produced in February 1897 by the action of the Greek cabinet in landing forces in Crete to support yet another of the many revolts there against Turkish rule. The Greco—Turkish war which was declared by the Sultan on 19 April was a disaster for the Greeks!; and after humiliating defeats in Thrace they were forced to accept an armistice on 19 May. None of the great states of Europe, however, was willing to allow the Turks to press their victory to a conclusion. The peace treaty which was signed in December provided that they should evacuate Thessaly in return for the payment of a war indemnity of four million Turkish pounds by the Greek government. The protection of the powers had thus ensured for Greece the return of the territory she had lost during the war, in spite of her complete lack of military success. The conflict did not arouse very serious international complications. This was partly because it was so unequal and so brief. It was also because the great powers were all, in varying degrees, tired of Near Eastern problems. Everyone was unwilling to allow the peace of Europe to be threatened by such a triviality as the misgovernment of Crete, while the Turkish victories had raised the prestige of Abdul Hamid from the abysmally low level to which it
* The Greek government, which realised the country’s weakness and was willing to accept merely autonomy under Turkish suzerainty for Crete, was helpless in the face of nationalist public opinion. In particular it could not resist the demands of
the nationalist Ethnike Hetairia society, to which most Greek army officers belonged.
262


THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY 1897-8 had sunk in 1895-6. The attitudes of the powers to the war inevitably differed somewhat; though all of them were determined to avoid a collapse of the Ottoman Empire. In particular pro-Greek elements in the cabinet succeeded, in spite of the opposition of Salisbury himself, in preventing British agreement with German and Russian suggestions that Greece be forced by an international blockade of her territory to withdraw from Crete. Nevertheless the powers were able, on 2 March 1897, to present identical notes to both belligerents demanding that Crete be made an autonomous province under Turkish suzerainty; and though popular feeling forced the Greek government to reject this solution of the Cretan problem it was embodied, in essentials, in an agreement with the Porte which Greece had to sign in September. But the precarious common action which the great states had achieved on the Cretan question did not survive the end of the war. Not until November 1808 was Prince George of Greece established as their Commissioner in Crete; and this very limited co-operation was attained only after Germany and Austria-Hungary had withdrawn their occupying forces from the island (where the coastal towns had been garrisoned by the powers) in protest against the pro-Greek attitude of the other states concerned. Of greater importance than the Greco—Turkish war was the fact that the years after 1896—7, when politically the Near East had been ‘put on ice’, saw a considerable increase there of the economic activity of some of the great powers and of economic rivalry between them. Neither the novelty nor the extent of this activity should be exaggerated. Trade between western Europe and the Levant was centuries old. European investment in the Ottoman Empire had been of political importance since the 1850s. Railway-building schemes there, often impossibly grandiose, had been enticing financiers and engineers intermittently for decades. Moreover in an age when the use of fuel oil was still in its infancy and the potentialities of the Kirkuk and Kuweit oilfields undreamed of, no major European state depended on the Ottoman Empire for more than a marginal contribution to its national wealth. Yet international competition for railway and other concessions, for trade with the empire and investment opportunities there, came to have an influence on the emotions of the nations involved quite disproportionate to the real value of what was at stake. In the two decades before 1914 the Ottoman Empire was not the most important area of international economic rivalry. But it was one of the most obvious and most glamorous of such areas; and in all the great

1888-99 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 countrymen of the dangers of lagging behind in the race for opportunities there. It was above all Germany which seemed to be increasing her economic influence in the Near East from the 1890s onwards; and it was above all the Baghdad Railway which seemed to symbolise the growth of her influence. The grant of a concession in October 1888 to a German syndicate for the building of a railway from Constantinople to Ankara (the line was completed less than five years later) had been strongly supported by British, Austrian and Italian influence at the Porte. Even a new concession which a group of German interests (the Deutsche Bank and the Anatolian Railway Company) signed in December 1899 for the possible construction of a line from Koniah to Baghdad, and eventually to the Persian Gulf, aroused at first little overt opposition. The German interests concerned had already taken pains to come to terms with their main French rivals; and the great German industrialist, Georg von Siemens, who was the main driving force behind the scheme, was anxious for British financial participation in it. Already, however, rumblings of apprehension were beginning to be faintly audible. Britain’s position was little affected by German activities in Anatolia. But their possible extension to Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf was a different matter. In January 1899 the Indian government, under one of the most energetic of all viceroys, Lord Curzon, made an agreement with the Sheikh of Kuweit by which the latter agreed to cede none of his territory and to receive no representative of any foreign state except with the consent of the British Resident at his court. It followed this up by forcing the Sultan of Oman to withdraw a concession for a coaling-station which he had just granted to the French government. It was thus clear even before the signature of the tentative agreement for the Baghdad Railway that Britain would do her utmost to exclude all European rivals from the Persian Gulf. Russia also showed signs of hostility in 1899 to the German railway-building schemes; and between April and June there were inconclusive negotiations for a Russo-German agreement on the sphere of influence each state might hope to obtain in the Ottoman Empire. These came to nothing, largely because of German fears that such an understanding would antagonise both the Turkish and the British governments. The result was that in March 1900 Russia forced the Porte to accept the so-called ‘Black Sea Agreement’. By this the Turkish government promised to grant no concessions for railway-building in northern Anatolia or Armenia except to Russian interests or to syndicates approved by the Tsar; and then only on

The effect which the Baghdad Railway scheme was beginning to exert on the British public, or at least on many British newspapers and members of parliament, was shown in 1903. In March of that year the Porte granted to the German-dominated Baghdad Railway Company a new and definitive concession for the line to the Persian Gulf. This replaced the preliminary concession of 1899 and revised it in several respects in favour of the Company. In need of money to make use of its new privileges and finding German capitalists doubtful of the profitability of the railway,! the Company attempted to raise part of the sum required in Great Britain. Many members of the British cabinet, notably Balfour, the Prime Minister, and above all Lord Lansdowne, the Foreign Secretary, were at first quite friendly to this idea. They still thought to some extent in terms of strengthening Turkey against Russia and saw the railway as a means to this end. Moreover British participation would prevent it becoming a purely German or German-dominated undertaking with all the dangers this involved. But the government was soon forced to change its attitude. This was because of pressure from the press and Parliament, which urged that it was dangerous for Britain to strengthen in this way a potential rival; and because the very powerful and anti-German Joseph Chamberlain, the Colonial Secretary, was strongly opposed to Britain having any hand in the building of the railway.? To a lesser extent the position may have been influenced by the hostility or lukewarmness shown by many British capitalists. The German proposals were therefore refused; and though the whole episode was much less important than many historians in the 1920s and 1930s believed it was none the less a

Brunner, De Bagdadspoorweg (Gréningen—Djakarta, 1957) provides in its appendices much statistical information on the operations and profits of foreign-owned railways in the Ottoman Empire in the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. 2 Optimistic estimates of the political and economic advantages to be derived fromit by Germany —e.g. Paul Rohrbach, Die Baghdadbahn (Berlin, 1902) helped to stimulate such feelings. 3 The railway was opposed by British shipping interests, which feared it might harm their trade; and notably by Lynch Brothers, who wished to protect their
position as river carriers on the Euphrates. But the opposition to British partici
pation was not merely the work of sectional interests of this kind as has sometimes been alleged.

1903-14 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 sign of the fear and distrust of Germany which were becoming increasingly widespread in Great Britain. The money which the Company needed was raised from other, mainly French, sources, and the building of the railway proceeded. The revolutions of 1908-9 in Constantinople! somewhat hampered it, for the victorious Young Turks showed themselves in the first months of their rule less willing than Abdul Hamid to give financial privileges and guarantees to its promoters. Work on the Amanus tunnels which were to carry the line through the Taurus mountains began only in 1913, mainly because of renewed financial difficulties. By then, however, there were clear indications that the suspicions which the railway had aroused among the European powers were dying down and that political opposition to it could be bought off fairly cheaply by the German government. Izvolskii, the Russian Foreign Minister, had already suggested in October 1906 that Russia might abandon her hostility to it in return for a German guarantee of her position in Persia. In August 1911 an agreement along these lines was signed at Potsdam. The Russian government promised not to oppose the completion of the railway: in return Germany promised to respect Russia’s monopoly of railway-building in northern Persia. The Baghdad railway was eventually to be joined with the Persian railway system, which would greatly improve the competitive position of German goods in Persia. This agreement showed that united opposition by the powers of the Triple Entente to German railway schemes in the Ottoman Empire, insofar as it had existed in the previous two or three years, was now at an end. In February 1914, by a secret convention, France promised to regard central and southern Anatolia, northern Syria and Mesopotamia (in other words the areas which would be crossed or directly affected by the Baghdad railway) as a German sphere of influence as far as railway-building was concerned. In return Germany recognised northern Anatolia and most of Syria (including Palestine) as French spheres for the same purpose. More important, British opposition to the railway had now begun to evaporate since it was clear that it would be built whatever was said or done in London. By a series of Anglo—Turkish agreements in July 1913~June 1914, the culmination of negotiations begun in rgrt, Britain secured concessions which fully safeguarded her position. British goods carried on the Baghdad railway system were assured equality of treatment with those of other states. The Turkish government was to use its influence to place two British directors on the board of the Baghdad Railway Company. British navigation rights 1 See pp. 275-6.

on the Tigris and Euphrates and in the Shatt-el-Arab at their mouth
were defined. Above all the Turkish government agreed not to
interfere in the affairs of Kuweit (though its suzerainty over the
sheikhdom was recognised by Great Britain) and not to allow the extension of the Baghdad railway to the Persian Gulf without British consent. Simultaneously Britain’s position was strengthened by an agreement of March 1914 by which Germany recognised the exclusive rights of the Anglo—Persian Oil Company, founded in 1909, in the development of the oil resources of southern Mesopotamia and central and southern Persia. By another Anglo-German pact, initialled on 15 June, Britain once more withdrew her opposition to the Baghdad railway (provided it terminated at Basra and was not continued to the Persian Gulf) and both powers accepted the principle of the ‘open door’ in Asiatic Turkey. By that date the line had reached Ras el Ain, about 200 kilometres beyond Aleppo. The Baghdad railway, therefore, though it gave rise to many excited speeches and inflammatory articles, was never a threat to European peace or even a source of really serious international tension. More than any other strand in the events of the years before 1914 its story illustrates the unwillingness of the great powers to quarrel really seriously about interests which were mainly economic. The railway was merely the most striking example of a growth of German economic activity in the Ottoman Empire and south-eastern Europe which can be seen from the 1880s onwards, A direct steamship connexion between Germany and the Near East was established in 1889 with the setting-up of the Deutsche Levant Linie. In 1906 the Hamburg—Amerika line began a regular service to the Persian Gulf. German holdings amounted to only 5°% of the Turkish public debt in 1881, when the Decree of Mouharrem was issued: they accounted for 20% of it in 1914. German trade with the Ottoman Empire was increasing rapidly, especially in the decade before the war. Nevertheless the importance of all this, and especially its influence on the policies of governments, should not be exaggerated. Of Germany’s foreign investment in 1914 only about a tenth was in the Ottoman Empire. Even as late as 1910 only about 1.4% of her exports went there and only about 0.7% of her imports came from the empire. Until 1914 British trade with Turkey remained more valuable than that of any other state. A sense of proportion is also needed where
German economic activity in the Balkans is concerned. Certainly
there was growing interest in Berlin in the idea of Mitteleuropa, of
some sort of economic and even political union covering Germany,

1980s-1914 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 Austria-Hungary, the Balkans and perhaps Turkey. But interest in
schemes of this sort (which in any case tended to attract professors and publicists rather than business men) was much more marked in the Habsburg Empire than in Germany. In the latter the attention of capitalists tended to be increasingly focused on opportunities in the Americas and the Far East. Trade with Rumania in the two decades before the war accounted for only about 1-2%, of all Germany’s imports and exports. Trade with Greece and Serbia, though increasing, was still of trivial importance; in neither case did it amount to more than 0.2°%, of the total of German commerce. What Germany’s rivals had to fear was not what she had achieved but what she might achieve in the fairly distant future. The threat she offered to their interests was not negligible; but it was far from immediate. International economic rivalries in the Near East were thus becoming more complex and more acute during this period. But most of the interests at stake were still relatively small. As yet the French holding in the Turkish public debt was the only European economic interest of really first-class importance in the Ottoman Empire; and it was not threatened by the events of this period.1 The economic opportunities available in Asia Minor, Syria and Mesopotamia might appear potentially immense to journalists, speculators and politically-minded professors. Statesmen fortunately took a more realistic view. The instability of this period in the Near East, and the great-power rivalries which it witnessed, must be explained in essentially political terms.
The national rivalries of the Balkan states were seen in their most acute and uncompromising form in the question of Macedonia, into the complexities of which the great powers were dragged willy-nilly. Simple in essentials it proved in practice quite insoluble. The province of Macedonia, which roughly corresponded to the Turkish vilayets of Kossovo, Monastir and Salonika, had ill-defined frontiers and a population hopelessly mixed ethnically and linguistically. By the end of the nineteenth century its largest single element thought of itself as Bulgarian, insofar as it thought in national terms at all; but the province also included large areas claimed by Serbia, Greeks in the vilayet of Salonika, Turks, Gipsies, Albanians and the scattered and ethnographically interesting Kutzo—Vlach minority who were closely akin to the Rumanians. Till relatively late in the

century Macedonia was little troubled by internal dissensions. Its
church was Greek; and since the suppression of the autocephalous Patriarchate of Ochrida in 1767 had been subject to the Patriarch in Constantinople. Inevitably the literate and articulate aspects of its culture, like those of Bulgaria till the mid-nineteenth century, were also Greek, while many of its ‘Greek’ inhabitants were in fact Hellenised Vlachs and Albanians. Its problems were those of clerical exploitation and Turkish misgovernment rather than of national or linguistic rivalries. The growth of Bulgarian national feeling would in any case have ended this relatively stable position; but the pace of events was quickened when in 1870 the Porte created the Bulgarian Exarchate and by so doing offered the Slav population of Macedonia an avenue of escape from Greek influence. Stefan Stambulov, the leading figure in Bulgarian politics until his murder in 1895, based his policies largely on co-operation with the Porte; and until his death the Turks showed themselves quite ready to check Greek influences in Macedonia by encouraging Bulgarian ones there. The bitterness with which the Greeks, whether Ottoman subjects or not, opposed the new development showed the danger to which they felt their position in the province now exposed: by the 1880s Greek and Bulgarian clerics were struggling to gain the upper hand there by propaganda, economic pressure and when necessary physical force.! In the early 1890s the position of the Bulgars was further strengthened when the Porte allowed the erection in Macedonia of four Bulgarian bishoprics; three others were created in 1897. Serbia’s entry into this tragic series of rivalries was delayed for some years. She was weakened by her lack in Macedonia of any ecclesiastical organisation of her own comparable to the Greek church or the Bulgarian Exarchate; it was only in 1896 that she obtained from the Porte the right to nominate a Serbian bishop in Macedonia. She also possessed an important alternative outlet for her territorial ambitions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. In the secret Austro-Serbian alliance of June 1881, however, the Habsburg government, anxious to divert her attention from these provinces, promised her diplomatic support in any effort she might make to gain territory in Macedonia provided that these gains did not include the Sanjak of Novibazar. Five years later the Society of St.

on influence, not on numbers. The Greeks were also weakened by the fact that
their schools taught classical Greek, which had no practical value, and not the
Romaic vernacular which was widely spoken in the coastal districts of Macedonia.

1890-1903 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
Sava was set up to carry on Serb propaganda and develop Serb
education (in practice the two functions were identical) in the province. By the early 1890s the intensity of these national rivalries was increasing rapidly. In 1894 a Greek secret society, the Ethniké Hetairia, began to organise anti-Bulgarian propaganda in Macedonia; but the complete defeat of the Greeks by the Turks in 1897 did irreparable damage to the Greek cause there. Intermittent efforts by the Serbian and Greek governments in 1890-8 to reach some agreement on their respective claims in the province failed completely. Nor did the other interested parties show any willingness to compromise. Stambulov and his successors, realising the strength of Bulgaria’s position in Macedonia, consistently rejected Greek and Serb suggestions that the province be partitioned; while in 1897 there was even an unsuccessful attempt by the Rumanian government to secure Turkish recognition of the Vlachs as a separate millet. Above all in 1893 there was founded at Salonika the Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organisation (I.M.R.O.). This, like the numerous Macedonian political clubs and societies which had been founded in Bulgaria in the 1880s, was the result of large-scale emigration from Macedonia after 1878 and of the formation in Bulgarian schools of a discontented semi-educated intellectual proletariat. It was at first a genuinely Macedonian organisation standing for the one possible constructive solution of the Macedonian problem — the autonomy of the province, perhaps as part of a great Balkan federation. Two years after its foundation, however, it found itself faced by a newly-founded rival group based in Bulgaria, the Supreme Committee or External Organisation, which envisaged the eventual annexation of Macedonia by Bulgaria and was more violent in its methods. (Both these organisations soon divided into factions the relations between which are still obscure). In May 1895 came the first large-scale raid from Bulgaria into Macedonia by adherents of the Supreme Committee in an effort to stimulate a rising there. After 1897 there was an accelerating collapse of public order in the province! coupled with a growth of violent hostility between I.M.R.O. and the Supreme Committee. This culminated in a series of bomb outrages in Salonika in April 1903 followed in August by a considerable revolt engineered by I.M.R.O. By the end of October the Turks had suppressed the revolt: its failure was

THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY 1902-3
followed by a still more bitter outbreak of rivalry between the different Macedonian revolutionary factions.} These events inevitably attracted the attention of the great powers. There had in 1902 been a good deal of ineffective discussion by them of possible reforms in Macedonia; and the revolt of 1903 was designed largely to provoke their intervention and force them to help in ending Turkish rule. This it achieved only to a very limited degree. Russia, whose relations with the Porte were now relatively good and whose government disliked revolutionary movements of any kind, showed herself hostile to the rebellion and warned the Bulgarian government to give it no support. (Zinoviev, the Russian ambassador in Constantinople did much to harden the Russian attitude to the rebels). Germany and Austria also showed no sympathy for the idea of an autonomous Macedonia; and before the revolt broke out the Russian and Austrian governments had jointly presented to the Porte, on 21 February 1903, an extremely limited and conservative programme of reforms in the administration of the province. The British attitude was more liberal. Lord Lansdowne, the Foreign Secretary, in a note of 29 September, suggested that the province should have a Christian governor, or at least Christian assessors to help him if he were a Turk; that its gendarmerie should have Christian officers; and that Turkish irregular forces should be withdrawn from its territory. When, three days later, Nicholas II and Francis Joseph, with their Foreign Ministers Count Lamsdorff and Count Goluchowski, met at Miirzsteg, a few miles from Vienna, they drew up a programme of Macedonian reforms based to some extent on the British note. But this programme greatly watered down Lansdowne’s proposals. In place of assessors, the Turkish Governor was to be helped merely by two ‘civil agents’; one Russian and one Austrian, with purely advisory powers. A European was to command the gendarmerie and each of the great powers was to be responsible for the policing of a specified part of the province. Administrative boundaries within Macedonia were to be redrawn to some extent along national lines and the autonomy of the different localities encouraged. But Lansdowne’s proposal for the withdrawal of Turkish troops had been abandoned, since no great power except Britain was prepared to support it. The Miirzsteg proposals were very reluctantly accepted by the Sultan on 24 November; but negotiations over their application dragged on for years. A proposed reform of the legal system came to

1903-8 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
nothing. The gendarmerie was given an Italian commander with
five senior officers under him, each representing one of the great
powers; but the proposed division of the province into sectors, for
each of which one of them would be responsible, proved very difficult to carry out. France was preoccupied in Morocco, Russia in the Far East. The Turks showed their usual skill in temporising and obstruction, spurred on by the fact that the loss of Macedonia would threaten the very existence of Turkish power in Europe and be a far more serious blow to the Empire than that of Crete or even the Armenian provinces. Austria and above all Germany wished to bolster up Turkish authority as far as possible. Of the great powers only Britain was seriously interested in improving the lot of the Macedonians. In December 1905 Abdul Hamid was at last forced, after a naval demonstration by the powers off Mytilene and Lemnos, to agree to an international commission to supervise the finances of the province; but this had no executive powers. Macedonia remained extremely insecure and badly governed. In April 1904 the Porte had forced the Bulgarian government to agree to disband the terrorist groups based on its territory; but the ministers in Sofia lacked the power as well as the will to keep this promise. Moreover the revolution of 1903 in Belgrade? led to a sharp increase in the activity of Serbian guerillas in Macedonia, which had hitherto been on a relatively small scale. By the beginning of 1908, however, the British government was ready to grasp the Macedonian nettle once more; and the ententes of April 1904 and August 1907 with France and Russia gave it greater chances of success than before.? In March it proposed that henceforth the Governor of Macedonia, though a Turkish subject, should be appointed only with the agreement of the powers; and that he should have under him a number of European officers paid from the revenues of the province. These proposals were accepted, after some hesitation, by Isvolskii, the Russian Foreign Minister, and by the French government. A meeting between Edward VIII and the Tsar at Reval at the end of May 1908 thus produced the so-called Isvolskii—Hardinge project of reform. 1 See p. 278. * The essentials of the Anglo-French agreement were that France recognised the position which Britain had since 1882 acquired in Egypt, while Britain recognised France’s leading position in Morocco (and, by implication, her right eventually to proclaim a French protectorate there). It also settled a number of lesser disputes over the frontiers of Siam and of British and French possessions in West Africa, and over fishing rights in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The Anglo—Russian entente created a Russian sphere of influence in northern Persia and a British one in the south-east of the country. The area between them was to be neutral, while
Britain was assured of a dominant position in Afghanistan. 272


THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY 1908
All these proposals to improve the position in Macedonia, were faced by strenuous opposition from Austria-Hungary and Germany. In some circles in the Dual Monarchy, particularly military ones, the idea that Macedonia might play an important part in the eventual expansion of Austrian influence to the Aegean was active. Early in 1908 Aehrenthal, the Austrian Foreign Minister, demanded of the Porte the exclusive right to economic concessions in the vtlayets of Kossovo and Salonika. In return for this, and for permission to build a railway through the Sanjak of Novibazar, he promised the Turks support in resisting European pressure for reform and help in ‘all problems affecting the Balkan peninsula’. In German ruling circles pro-Turkish feeling was growing, thanks partly to the influence of the able German ambassador at Constantinople, Baron Marschall von Bieberstein.! Both governments wished to prolong the corrupt and inefficient rule of the Porte in Macedonia rather than see it replaced by some effective form of international regime. But however meagre its practical results this constant foreign interference in Macedonia had by 1908 alarmed and infuriated a considerable number of patriotic Turks, above all in the army. Faced by the threat that yet another province might be lost to the Empire at least de facto, as Egypt already had been, they were now ready to overthrow the Sultan who had antagonised them by his apparent weakness as much as by the corruption of his regime. The Reval meeting gave the signal for the Young Turk revolution. Discontent of several kinds had been gathering strength in the Ottoman Empire for decades. The first and most dangerous type was the feeling that the Hamidian regime, if it continued, would be fatal to the continued existence of the empire, that the Sultan and his ministers were becoming more and more the tools of the great powers and particularly of Germany. The defeats and losses which the empire had suffered in the last century were now having a cumulative effect on the minds of many Turks and seemed an unanswerable condemnation of the inefficient autocracy which had permitted them. The resentment aroused by foreign pressure and foreign threats can be easily understood. Not only had Greece, Serbia, Rumania, Bulgaria, Cyprus and Egypt been lost, de facto or de jure, to the empire; not only had Russia advanced in the Caucasus and Turkey’s tenuous suzerainty over Algiers and Tunis disappeared ; but even within the empire’s contracted frontiers the authority of

273


¢. 1880-1907 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 the Sultan seemed increasingly to be disregarded and nullified by
the powers. Since 1832 Samos had been an autonomous principality.
Since 1861 the Lebanon had possessed a special status under a Christian governor appointed with the consent of the powers. Since 1898 Crete had been autonomous under a governor whose appointment was now in the hands of the King of Greece. Since 1881 foreign control of the Ottoman Debt had meant that a large part of the empire’s revenues were no longer controlled by the Sultan and his ministers. Now it seemed that Macedonia was also to be lost, not to speak of the very real danger of foreign intervention if there were another Armenian rising.! These losses, it was felt, were the result of the weakness and inefficiency of the government, which the Sultan, intent merely on clinging to his throne, would do nothing to remedy. Moreover the infiltration of European ideas and techniques into Turkey, the increasing consciousness of Europe’s superior efficiency, especially of her superior military efficiency, made the backwardness of the empire seem increasingly intolerable. Allied with this demand for greater strength and efficiency, though not logically connected with it, was one for greater political freedom. The first appearance in the 1860s of what later became the Young Turk movement has already been mentioned. At first faint, the demand for political change was becoming increasingly audible in the 1880s and 18gos. A number of newspapers were by then being published, particularly in Paris, by anti-Hamidian refugees; and in 1896 there were even unsuccessful plans for a military rising in Constantinople. The following year Abdul Hamid succeeded in weakening this emigré opposition to his rule by promises of concessions and reforms; these led to a reconciliation with most of the Young Turk leaders in Western Europe and the congress of Ottoman Liberals which met in Paris in February 1902 achieved nothing. Its non-Turkish members — Greeks, Armenians, Arabs, Jews — hoped to achieve their aims by western intervention, which most of the Turks who attended refused to contemplate. A second congress in December 1907, also in Paris, was equally ineffective. Moreover the Ottoman emigrés were deeply divided between a group which aimed at decentralising the government of the empire, largely along racial and linguistic lines, and another which demanded strong centralised government. ‘The Sultan could never be overthrown by propaganda from western Europe but only by internal revolt. Of such action the army, its pay always in arrears and its officers one of the most Euro

peanised groups in the empire, was the natural spearhead. Army officers had been prominent in the revolutionary movement in Turkey since the beginning and mutinies provoked by arrears of pay were very frequent in 1906-8. In 1906 a young captain, Mustapha Kemal, founded at Damascus the secret society Vatan (Fatherland) ; this was soon merged in the more important Society of Union and Progress which had its main centre in Salonika.! Clearly even Abdul Hamid’s remarkable powers of survival were about to be put to a severe test. Eariln Jyuly 1908 a military revolt broke outin Macedonia, quite spontaneously and without instructions or leadership from Salonika. On the 6th of that month, at the little town of Resne, west of Monastir, a major and the men under his command mutinied, demanding the restoration of the constitution of 1876. Next day Shemsi Pasha, the officer who had been sent by the Sultan to suppress the growing unrest among the troops in the area, was murdered by one of his own officers. ‘The mutiny spread rapidly; and on the 21st its leaders, now in control of much of what remained of European Turkey, threatened to march on Constantinople unless the constitution were restored. On the 24th Abdul Hamid surrendered completely to their demands. The parliament dissolved in 1878 was recalled and elections held in November produced (after a good deal of bullying of electors and falsification of returns) a large majority for the rebels, who were by now generally referred to in western Europe as the Young Turks. It seemed that the empire was about to become, if not a model democracy, at least some sort of democracy. There were hopes that at last Turks and non-Turks, Muslims and non-Muslims, might live together on terms of real equality. There was a sharp rise in the popularity and influence at Constantinople of Great Britain, which was identified in the public mind with political liberty, and an equally abrupt fall in that of Germany and Russia. But the difficulties of the new regime were enormous. It had to face the covert hostility of the Sultan, who could draw support from the still very powerful forces of religious conservatism. It was faced by grave external problems, for it could do nothing to resist the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina by the Habsburg Empire and the proclamation of independence by Ferdinand of Bulgaria. Above all its
1 The influences which contributed to the formation of this famous society have often been discussed but are still rather obscure. It seems clear that the significance in this respect of the important Jewish colony in Salonika was less than has often been thought; but the extent to which the society was modelled on the I.M.R.O. and drew support from the Masonic lodges and the Bektashi order of dervishes is still uncertain. 2 See p. 282.

leaders lacked political experience and were not united.1 The division
already seen so clearly among the emigrés between those who favoured decentralisation and those, led by the Committee of Union and Progress, who stood for centralised and therefore inevitably Turkish-dominated government was still unbridged. By the spring of 1909 the revolutionaries found themselves opposed by both the liberals and the Sultan; and on 12 April a rising against them, fomented largely by religious conservatives, broke out in the capital. There were simultaneous outbreaks over much of Asia Minor in which several thousands of Armenians were massacred. Almost at once an army from Macedonia commanded by Mahmud Shevket Pasha began to advance to the defence of the revolution. On the 23rd it occupied Constantinople. Abdul Hamid was deposed and exiled to Salonika; his successor, Mehmed Resad, was quite unable to influence the course of events. The Committee of Union and Progress, a junta of self-appointed revolutionary leaders, was now in control. It was to remain in control, with one or two short intervals, till the collapse of the empire in 1918. The triumph of the revolutionaries in 1909 did not and could not solve the problems of the Ottoman Empire. In some ways it made them worse. The ‘Ottomanism’, the loyalty to the empire irrespective of race, language or religion, which the revolutionaries preached and in which some of them believed, had never the faintest chance of achievement. A Law of Associations of August 1909, which forbade all political organisations based on ethnic or national groups, could do nothing to halt the growth of nationalism which was now threatening the Empire with destruction. In Macedonia national hatreds still raged, and the revolution led to the withdrawal of the foreign officers, the winding-up of the International Financial Commission and the recalling by Austria and Russia of the Civil Agents. In Armenia there were still hopes of independence or at least of autonomy.? In November 1908 an Albanian National Congress representing Muslims, Catholics and Orthodox, met at Monastir; and though it supported the Young Turks their policies led to a serious Albanian revolt in 1910 and another in the following year. Above all Arab nationalism was slowly growing, fed by a remark

British Documents on the Origins of the War (London, 1926-38) v. 267). * In 1913 the Armenian leader, Boghos Nubar Pasha, with Russian support, visited the capitals of western Europe in an effort to secure the establishment of an autonomous Armenia under a European commissioner appointed by the Porte.

ably rapid development of the press in the Arab areas. (In 1908-14. about sixty newspapers — nearly all of them very short-lived appeared in Beyrut and about forty in Baghdad.) Already in the last decades of the nineteenth century its greatest intellectual figure, Djamal al-din al-Afghani (1838-97), had begun to stress the creative and civilising role played in history by the Arabs, in contrast to the Turks, and to demand the division of the Ottoman Empire into a number of largely autonomous units. Later Arab nationalist writers began to demand that the Caliphate should no longer be held by the Ottoman rulers and that it should be established at Mecca with temporal power over the Hedjaz. By 1905 the Ligue de la Patrie Arabe, which had just been set up in Paris by a Palestine Arab, Neguib Azuri, was dreaming of a united Arab state under a liberal government which would stretch from Mesopotamia to Suez and from the eastern Mediterranean to Oman. As yet few Arabs shared these dreams. The religious link with the Turks provided by Islam was still of great importance; and few Arab leaders wished to do more than give greater autonomy to the Arab provinces. As late as 1913 the Arab Congress held in Paris (its members came almost entirely from Syria) asked merely for decentralisation and reform, not independence. But the demand for outright independence, though still voiced mainly by a few intellectuals, never ceased to be put forward. In rg11 a secret society was founded in Paris to work for it. In the same year a group of Arab deputies in Constantinople wrote to the Sharif of Mecca and offered to support him if he would rebel against Turkish rule. The Turks themselves could not escape the nationalism which was now afflicting so many of their subject-peoples. They were remarkably slow to develop the idea of a Turkish nation (i.e. one composed of Turkish-speaking Muslims) as distinct from the multinational Ottoman state and the world-wide Islamic religion. But the obvious failure of ‘Ottomanism’ and the collapse of so many of the hopes and ideals of 1908-9 soon led to an accelerated growth of national feeling and efforts to Turkify the subject-peoples of the empire. This Turkish nationalism owed a good deal to European influences, particularly to studies of the early history of the Turks published by European scholars. It was also influenced by refugees
and exiles from the Tatar and Turkish areas of the Russian Empire,
from the Volga basin, the Crimea, central Asia and the Caucasus.
These contributed much to the growth of pan-Turkish or “Turanian’
ambitions which aimed at some form of political union of all the
Turkish-speaking peoples in the Ottoman and Russian Empires,
Persia, Afghanistan and even western China, though these im
277


1903-5 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 practicable dreams never aroused much response amongst ordinary
Ottoman Turks.
Thus in the years before 1914 it was not merely the subject-peoples of the empire, the Arabs, Armenians, Slavs and to some extent
Albanians, who were turning their backs on the Ottoman past. The
ruling race itself was adopting new political ideas and models. The
disintegration of the empire, held together merely by a tenuous
feeling of loyalty to the dynasty and by physical force, was certain to continue. The European, as distinct from merely Ottoman or Near Eastern, significance of the Turkish revolution lay in the opportunity it seemed to provide for Austria-Hungary to strengthen her position in the Balkans by annexing Bosnia and Herzegovina. Throughout the decade before 1914 Austrian policy was the most dangerous element in the whole tangle of Balkan politics. The sequence of events which changed that policy from the relatively cautious and non-interventionist one of the 1897 agreement with Russia and the Miirzsteg meeting of October 1903 began in June of the latter year. On the night of the 10-11th of that month King Alexander of Serbia and his wife were murdered in Belgrade by a group of army officers. The murders were provoked largely by trivial personal factors Alexander’s autocratic rule and personal unpopularity, the low birth of his wife, which made her unacceptable to many Serbs, the activities of supporters of the exiled Karageorgevich dynasty — but they had important repercussions. Alexander, like his father, had been a client and protégé of Austria. A few months before his death he had offered, in return for Austria’s support of Serbian claims in Macedonia, to hand over the Serbian railways to her and conclude a customs and military agreement with he —rin other words to make Serbia a dependency of the Habsburg Empire. Peter Karageorgevich, who was proclaimed King by the Skupshchina on 15 June, soon showed himself quite unwilling to follow this line of policy. Sympathetic, at least in theory, to liberal ideas (he had translated some of John Stuart Mill into Serbo—Croat) he tended to be Russophil in his foreign policy and to favour the Radical party in domestic affairs. Above all he wished to reduce Austrian economic influence in Serbia, which had been dominant for a generation, and tried in particular, with little success, to improve economic relations with Bulgaria in 1904-5. For several reasons the changed attitude of Serbia seemed insulting and dangerous in Vienna. If she successfully threw off
Austrian influence she would deal a considerable blow to the
prestige of the Habsburg Monarchy. Moreover nothing that in
278


THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY 1905-11
creased Russian influence anywhere in the Balkans could ever be welcome to the Austrian government. Above all a really independent Serbia raised at once the fear that she might become the nucleus of a large South Slav state which might threaten the very existence of the Habsburg Empire. This fear was fully justified. In the autumn of 1905 a group of Croat deputies from the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments met at Fiume and passed a resolution affirming the unity of Croatia and their opposition to the domination of the empire by the Germans and Magyars. An assembly of Serbs at Zara shortly afterwards also denounced the system of dualism under which the empire had been governed since 1867. An independent Serbia, which might so easily attract the support and loyalty of those discontented South Slavs, was thus a very real danger to AustriaHungary. The antagonism between the two states was shown openly when, in January 1906, the Austrian government forbade all imports of livestock from Serbia. This was in reply to a Serb—Bulgarian customs agreement signed in June 1905; and though the Serbian government soon offered to modify it relations between Belgrade and Vienna remained very bad, particularly when, at the end of 1906, Serbia placed an armaments order with the French Schneider—Creusot firm in preference to the Austrian Skoda company. The Serbs moreover gave another display of their new-found independence by taking up once more, in 1905-6, the idea of a Danube—Adriatic railway first put forward in the 1870s, while French banks instead of Austrian ones began to play a leading part in their foreign borrowing. The Austrian embargo therefore continued; and efforts to end the so-called ‘pig war’ did not achieve final success till 1911. Serbia, by showing herself able to withstand with considerable success economic pressure of this kind (livestock, and above all pigs, were by far her most important export) increased her own self-confidence and the fear and dislike with which she was regarded in Vienna. In the autumn of 1906 the relatively moderate Goluchowski was succeeded as Foreign Minister of Austria-Hungary by the more uncompromising and aggressive Baron Aehrenthal. From the beginning the weakening and if possible destruction of Serbia was the supreme objective of his policies. Only the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Monarchy and the partition of Serbia between it and Bulgaria could, he thought, give Austria-Hungary real security on her southern frontier. Early in 1908, as a first step towards the encirclement and weakening of Serbia, he announced that Austria would build a railway through the Sanjak of Novibazar
to Mitrovitza in Turkish territory, where it would link up with the
279


1908 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
existing line to Salonika. Within a few months, however, this project
had been dropped in favour of a more far-reaching one; and the
incoherence of Russian policy and the support of Germany had
allowed him to carry out a considerable part of his anti-Serb
programme. Izvolskii, the newly-appointed Russian Foreign
Minister, had perhaps more ability than he is usually credited with. But he was ambitious and unrealistic. When in January 1908 Aehrenthal announced his plan for the building of the Sanjak railway he reacted violently. Early in the following month he proposed to the Russian Council of Ministers that efforts be made to persuade Britain to co-operate in putting pressure on the Turks to oppose the Austrian scheme. He even envisaged an Anglo—Russian attack on Turkey. The weakness of Russia after the disastrous war of 1904-5 with Japan, not to speak of the impossibility of securing British agreement, made this proposal a piece of criminal folly. It was treated as such by the Russian Prime Minister, Stolypin, who pointed out that ‘a policy other than pacific and exclusively defensive would be, at this moment, the delirium of a government which has lost its reason’.! This attitude was shared by the other members of the Council of Ministers, notably by the Navy Minister, Dikov, and the representatives of the army, Generals Polivanov and Palitsyn. Isvolskii was not discouraged, however. From the end of April onwards he made a series of approaches to Aehrenthal for a Russo—Austrian agreement on various Balkan questions — railwaybuilding, Macedonia, the still undefined frontiers of the Sanjak of Novibazar. Above all he showed himself willing to agree to an Austrian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina if in return Aehrenthal would support the opening of the Straits to Russian warships. The idea of securing some change in Russia’s favour of the existing regime of the Straits was not in itself unreasonable. The British government had already shown in the negotiations of 1906—7 for the Anglo—Russian entente that it would not oppose such a change; though it refused, because of the opposition it expected from public opinion and the risk of alarming the other powers concerned, to make any formal agreement on this point.? Nevertheless as matters then stood Izvolskii’s proposal was not realistic. He was offering, in effect, Russian consent to a strengthening of Austria’s Balkan position, and

thus risking the loss of Serbian goodwill and even the destruction of Serbia, in return for a quite inadequate equivalent; for Russia’s Black Sea fleet was weak and free passage for it through the Straits of little immediate value to her. Memoranda drawn up in the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1904 and 1905 had stressed that the existing regime of the Straits was on the whole favourable to Russia: in particular it helped to safeguard her position in the Black Sea from attack by powers with stronger navies. Nevertheless in an ardememoire to Vienna of 2 July Izvolskii made it clear that Russia might consent to accept this unequal exchange of benefits; and on 19 August Aehrenthal secured the consent of a ministerial council in Vienna to the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. On 15 September the two statesmen met at Buchlau, a shooting-box in Moravia. No written agreement was made at Buchlau, a fact which more than anything else accounts for the violent disagreements to which the meeting almost at once gave rise. Aehrenthal claimed that Izvolskii had declared himself ready to observe, in principle, a favourable attitude to the annexation of the two provinces; while he himself had promised in return, also in principle, a similar attitude on the part of the Dual Monarchy to the opening of the Straits to the warships of Russia and the other Black Sea states. Izvolskii did not challenge the essential accuracy of this account, but claimed that he had insisted that this agreement involved a breach of the Berlin settlement of 1878 and therefore must be approved at an international conference by all the signatories of that settlement. Aehrenthal for his part denied that Izvolskii had ever said that the agreement was a breach of the decisions taken at Berlin. There was also acute disagreement as to what had been said about the timing of the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Izvolskii insisted that Aehrenthal had not made it clear that the annexation had been definitely decided on in Vienna and that it was soon to be carried out. Aehrenthal on the other hand alleged that he had told the Russian minister that the annexation might take place early in October. Certainly Izvolskii began to complain of the speed with which Aehrenthal acted only after he had begun to realise how much opposition his own policies had aroused in Russia. Whether as the result of duplicity or of mere misunderstandings, therefore, the two statesmen were at cross-purposes almost from the moment of the meeting. Izvolskii, believing or pretending to believe

that Achrenthal contemplated no immediate action, spent the days
following his visit to Buchlau in negotiations with the Italian,
German, French and Turkish governments designed to pave the
way for the new position at the Straits. But little more than a
fortnight after the meeting he received a letter from the Austrian
Foreign Minister announcing that the annexation would take place on 7 October (it was actually proclaimed on the 5th). Simultaneously, though this had not been intended by Aehrenthal, Ferdinand of Bulgaria proclaimed his country’s independence of the Ottoman Empire. Whether or not Aehrenthal knowingly deceived Izvolskii the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina placed the Russian minister in an impossible position. Stolypin was bitterly opposed to the Buchlau agreement and to the surrender of Slav territory to foreign rule which it involved. He threatened to resign if it were carried out by Russia. Nicholas II also disliked the role played by his Foreign Minister and complained that he had exceeded his powers by making the agreement and thus giving the impression that the Tsar was willing to hand over a Slav people to Austrian rule. The international position was unfavourable to Russia. Her only ally, France, was unwilling to support any change in the position at the Straits and had her hands full in Morocco. Britain also refused to back Izvolskii’s schemes. The Young Turk government appeared to be strongly pro-British and to have thrown off the German influences which had been so powerful at Constantinople for the last decade: the British cabinet was therefore unwilling to do anything which might create difficulties for it. Moreover British public opinion was still hostile (or believed by the government to be hostile) to the grant of free passage through the Straits to Russian warships, though the cabinet itself was willing to accept this. All Izvolskii could do, therefore, to save his face and that of Russia, was to demand that the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina should be approved by an international conference. He hoped at first that such a conference would also be able to discuss the Straits, but this proposal was soon dropped. Aehrenthal on his side was not altogether free from difficulties. The fact that the annexation had been decided on without any consultation with the German government aroused some resentment in Berlin. William II complained that he had been ‘deeply wounded in my feelings as an ally that I was not previously taken in the least into the confidence of His Majesty (Francis Joseph)’.1 Above all the

282


THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY 1908-9 influential Marschall von Bieberstein in Constantinople intensely disliked the annexation and urged that Germany should follow her own line of policy regardless of what the Habsburg Monarchy did. He feared that Germany, as Austria’s ally, would have to share in Constantinople some of the odium of the annexation; and on 8 October he declared formally to the Porte that it had not been concerted with the German government.! But Austria-Hungary was now Germany’s only real ally. She alone had supported the German government, though not always very willingly, during the Moroccan crisis of 1905-6 and the Algeciras conference which ended it. Her friendship seemed in Berlin increasingly valuable; and Prince von Bulow, the German Chancellor, had decided from the beginning of the crisis that she must be supported. He knew in any case that Russia was incapable of fighting a war and that his attitude therefore involved no real danger for Germany. He was able, without much difficulty, to persuade the Kaiser to accept this viewpoint. AustriaHungary was thus, for the time being at least, in an almost impregnable position. She was in physical possession of Bosnia and Herzegovina and could rely on German support. Russia by contrast was weak and relatively isolated. Aehrenthal therefore, with German backing, refused to attend any conference called to discuss the annexation. Turkey, he insisted, must accept the fazt accompli before the powers met; when they did meet they should discuss only relatively minor issues such as the frontiers of Montenegro, the position of the Armenians, the navigation of the Danube or the Capitulations. By adopting this attitude and rejecting Izvolskii’s proposals he altered the whole scope of the crisis. The annexation had been a move against Serbia and had produced great excitement there. The Serbian army had been partially mobilised, the government had protested against the Austrian action and there had been some popular clamour for war. An Austro—Serbian conflict provoked by Serbian demands for ‘compensation’? would have been welcomed by the Austrian Chief of Staff, Conrad von Hoétzendorff, and probably by Aehrenthal himself, as an opportunity to destroy Serbia for good. But Aehrenthal had not wished to humiliate Russia; and yet the rebuff she suffered was the most important result of the crisis. The early months of 1909 made it even clearer than before that while Germany would, if necessary, give armed support to Austria
1 Lindow, op. cit., pp. 115-19. 2 i.e. the cession to Serbia of part of Bosnia and Herzegovina to give her a common frontier with Montenegro, or that of part of the Sanjak of Novibazar or of a railway corridor to a port on the Adriatic.
283


1909 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 Hungary, France and Britain would not do the same for Russia. On
21 January Moltke, the German Chief of Staff, told Conrad that ‘at the same moment that Russia mobilises, Germany will also mobilise, and will mobilise her entire army’.! By contrast the French government on 9 February reached with Germany an agreement which recognised French political dominance in Morocco, while on the same day Edward VII began a state visit to Berlin. On the 26th France made it quite clear in St. Petersburg that she would not back Russia in a war with Germany and Austria-Hungary designed merely to support Serbian claims; simultaneously the Turkish government signed an agreement with Austria by which it recognised the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in return for compensation of 24 million Turkish pounds for the loss of the Turkish crown lands there. Moreover the British and French governments, though willing to support Serbian claims for some form of undefined economic compensation, made it clear in Belgrade that they would not see her claims for territorial gains pushed to the point of war. Russia and Serbia had thus no option but to accept the new situation. On 27 February Izvolskii told Nelidov, the Russian ambassador at Belgrade, that Serbia must abandon her territorial claims and refrain from any provocative action. Aehrenthal, however, was determined to exploit his victory to the full. He demanded that Serbia should accept the Austro-Turkish agreement of 26 February, formally recognise the annexation of the two provinces and give Austria guarantees of a ‘correct and peaceful policy’. If these demands had not been accepted by the end of March, he told the German government, Austria would present an ultimatum in Belgrade and invade Serbia if it were rejected. He had, however, by now abandoned the idea of partitioning Serbia with Bulgaria ‘because this would produce throughout Europe a high state of excitement the consequences of which were difficult to foresee’. He also realised that to incorporate the whole country into the Habsburg Empire would merely add several millions to the already large number of discontented Slavs under its rule and make its nationalities problem more insoluble than ever. He had now decided, therefore, if war with Serbia broke out, merely to impose on her a large war indemnity and to hold Belgrade as a guarantee of its payment. Eventually, he hoped, the country might become a republic, since like many conservative statesmen even as late as 1909 he thought of republican government as inherently weak. Much to the disappointment of Conrad and the military party at 1 Schmitt, op. cit., p. 96.
284


THE BAGHDAD RAILWAY 1909
Vienna war with Serbia did not break out. On 13 March a Crown Council held at Tsarskoe Selo agreed that Russia could not possibly fight in defence of the Serbs (though the Tsar himself appears to have withheld his decision). On the 21st the German government presented at St. Petersburg the most important document of the crisis, a note in which it demanded that Russia should clearly and formally accept the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. If this were not done, it said, Germany ‘would then draw back and let matters take their course’ (i.e. allow Austria-Hungary to invade Serbia). The note was in fact if not in form an ultimatum. Biilow may well have hoped, by sending it, to stress that it was German power which had in the end forced Russia to give way and thus to punish Aehrenthal for the independence which he had shown in the early stages of the crisis; certainly relations between the Austrian minister and the German government remained strained until the former’s death in February 1912. The Russians, with intense bitterness, had to give way to the German demands. On the gist Serbia promised to ‘abandon the attitude of protest and opposition which she has maintained towards the annexation since last autumn’ and to ‘change the direction of her present policy towards AustriaHungary in order to live henceforth on terms of good neighbourliness with the latter’. She also agreed to reduce her army and prevent the formation on her territory of irregular units hostile to Austria, The crisis was at an end. The Central Powers had won. Inevitably they had to pay a price for their victory. The crisis had given a temporary and unjustified fillip to Austrian self-confidence; but it had also greatly increased Russian hostility to the Habsburg monarchy and above all to Germany. Hitherto there had always been in St. Petersburg powerful conservative groups which had wished to concentrate above all on the struggle against revolution within Russia. They had stood, therefore, for an unadventurous foreign policy, at least in Europe, and in particular for a good understanding with Germany which would safeguard Russia’s western frontiers. Though these groups continued to exist, their influence was seriously weakened by the events of 1908-9 and the ‘diplomatic Tsushima’ of Russia’s surrender to German threats." Early in May 1909 the German government attempted to press home the advantage it believed it had gained and to detach Russia from Britain and France. It proposed that Germany, Austria and Russia should unite to guarantee the new status quo in the Balkans (including of course the Austrian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina).

1909 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 Austria, it was suggested, should undertake to make no further advances in the area: if she broke this promise Germany would not regard a Russian attack on her as a casus foederis under the AustroGerman alliance of 1879. Moreover Russia was promised German support for any further effort she might make to alter the regime of the Straits, if in return she would promise to remain neutral in case of a British attack on Germany. This effort to recreate the Drerkaiserbund of 1881 was unsuccessful, as were other suggestions in the following year for a Russo-German agreement. Far from being favourable to these German initiatives, the years which followed the Bosnian crisis saw in St. Petersburg intensified efforts to increase Russia’s military strength and a growing stress on the need for closer co-operation with Britain and France, though Russia’s rivalry with Britain in Persia and the Far East was still strong enough to limit the practical effect of this. Most serious of all, the crisis had exacerbated rather than solved the difficulties of the South Slav question. Austrian rule had never been popular in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Serb nationalists were bitterly resentful of the apparent riveting of the Habsburg yoke on their kinsmen across the frontier and the blow this represented to hopes for a great South Slav state. ‘Here’, reported Forgach, the Austrian minister at Belgrade, on 3 April 1909, ‘all think of revenge, which is only to be carried out with the help of the Russians’.1 The events of 1908-9 had made the Balkans once more the powder-keg of European politics. For two decades its problems had ceased to be a real threat to European peace. But henceforth the European powers, their colonial rivalries damped down if not ended, were to be more and more involved in the affairs of this unstable peninsula. The Habsburg Empire was now at grips with a great block of South Slav population which it could neither assimilate nor destroy and to which it could not permit national liberty and unity without itself committing suicide. Russia was still deeply interested in Asia. But she was now also increasingly involved in the Balkans by considerations of prestige and strategy, by Panslav sentiment and even (because of her rapidly-growing trade through the Straits)? of economic interest. Behind Austria~Hungary stood Germany; behind Russia, with much less determination and consistency, Britain and France. Until the final catastrophe of 1914 the preoccupation of the great powers with the affairs of the Near East was to be continuous and growing.

The Near East before the
First World War
1909-14
AFTER the French occupation of Tunis in 1881 Tripoli, the last possession remaining to the Ottoman Empire in North Africa, increasingly appeared to many Italians a natural field for expansion. It was poor and barren; but its nearness to Italy, memories of Roman rule there, and above all the fact that it was now the only part of North Africa not desired by any other great power, seemed to destine it to fall under Italian control. In 1890 the Italian Prime Minister, Crispi, had already tried hard though unsuccessfully to secure British and German backing for Italy’s ambitions there. In the early years of the twentieth century his successors, knowing that Italy was too weak to consult only her own interests in the matter, cautiously secured the agreement of nearly all the major European states to the annexation of the province. In 1900 the French government offered to allow Italy to take Tripoli once France had acquired Morocco. In 1902 Austria—Hungary agreed to give Italy a free hand in the acquisition of the province, while Britain promised not to oppose Italian action there. In October 1909, by the so-called Racconigi agreement, Italy secured Russian approval for her ambitions in Tripoli in return for a promise not to oppose Russian schemes to alter the position at the Straits (the idea of opening the Straits to Russian warships was not killed in St. Petersburg by the defeat it had suffered during the Bosnian crisis). In November of that year the Italian government strengthened its position still further by an agreement with Austria by which the two powers agreed to co-operate in the Balkans. As it became clearer that Morocco was
now de facto a French protectorate, the demands of the Italian
nationalist press for ‘compensation’ in Tripoli grew louder and petty
friction between Italy and the Ottoman Empire increased. Efforts

between the two states (and thus avoid a possibly embarrassing choice between Italy, still a member of the Triple Alliance, and Turkey, which they wished to preserve and strengthen) were unsuccessful. On 28 September 1911 the Italian government presented an ultimatum in Constantinople declaring its intention to occupy Tripoli in view of the danger to Italians living there from the agitation against them being stirred up by the local authorities. The Turkish government was given twenty-four hours in which to consent to the occupation, and in spite of its conciliatory reply to the ultimatum war was declared the following day. The outbreak of this war, one of the most unjustified in European history,! seemed to raise once more the possibility of a complete collapse of the Ottoman Empire and the problems which would follow such a collapse. It was therefore unpopular with the great powers, which would inevitably be responsible for any new settlement which might be required in the Near East. In the smaller Balkan capitals it stimulated both fears and hopes. In Belgrade there were fears that Austria might take advantage of the situation to seize the Sanjak of Novibazar, in Sofia fears of a Turkish attack, in Cettinje hopes of territorial gains in Albania and in Athens hopes of a final and formal annexation of Crete. More important, the war led to another clumsy effort by Russia, or rather by a group of Russian diplomats, to secure the opening of the Straits to Russian warships. (There had already been a good deal of discussion in St. Petersburg, in May—August 1911, of the possibility of obtaining this.) In November tg11 the Italian government seemed about to extend the scope of the struggle, which was going badly for it in Tripoli, by attacking Turkey at Salonika and the Straits and on the Syrian coast.? This was almost certainly a bluff meant to frighten the Turks or to force the great powers to put pressure on them to make peace. But it at once aroused serious alarm in St. Petersburg. A large part of Russia’s foreign trade now passed through the Straits — in 1903-12 37% of her exports were shipped through them. In particular the overwhelming majority of her grain exports followed this route; and it was above all by exporting grain to western Europe that she was able to pay the interest on her foreign debt. Moreover her grain exports through the Straits had recently been increasing very rapidly: they doubled in 1908-10. To her the closure of this vital artery by the Italian fleet was quite intolerable.
1 The Porte offered, before hostilities began, to discuss a settlement of the Italian claims in Tripoli. 2 Aehrenthal had successfully insisted from the outbreak of the war that there should be no Italian naval action in the Adriatic.

Affairs (Sazonov, the Minister, was ill at the time) proposed
collective action by the powers in Rome and Constantinople to
prevent any interference with the use of this great seaway by merchant shipping. The proposal had no result; and its failure helped Charykoy, the Russian ambassador at Constantinople, to put forward a more ambitious scheme. Already, early in October, Neratov had instructed him if the prospects seemed favourable to begin tentative negotiations with the Turkish government for the opening of the Straits to Russian warships, and had himself sounded the French and Italian governments in an effort to secure their agreement to this. On 12 October, therefore, Charykov presented to the Porte a draft Russo—Turkish agreement in which he offered to work for a stabilisation of relations between Turkey and the Balkan states on the basis of the statuqsuo and also to discuss possible changes in the Capitulations in favour of Turkey. It seems clear that in doing this the ambassador committed himself further than Neratov had intended. On 27 November Charykov returned to the attack by proposing to the Porte the opening of the Straits to Russian naval vessels in return for a Russian guarantee of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire. This proposal was inspired, like that of October and the discussion in St. Petersburg earlier in the year, by the realisation that the Turkish Black Sea fleet was becoming more powerful than that of Russia and by a resulting desire to be able to pass through the Straits into the Black Sea ships of the Russian Baltic squadron. Charykov also hoped to construct some kind of entente between Turkey and the Balkan states and thus block any further growth of Austrian power in the peninsula. All these proposals were doomed from the start. They came at a moment when Anglo—Russian relations in Persia were very strained and Britain was therefore unwilling to support them. Sir Edward Grey, who had been British Foreign Secretary since December 1905, told Count Benckendorff, the Russian ambassador in London, that though free passage through the Straits for Russian warships might be acceptable in time of peace it would be impossible in wartime to place Russia’s opponents in a position of inferiority in this respect. The Russian government, however, refused to abandon its ambitions in Persia to win British support at the Straits; rightly so, since the
British would probably have refused to back it wholeheartedly there
however great the price Russia offered. By the end of the year
relations between the two states were so bad that Grey was talking
in terms of the dissolution of the Anglo—Russian entente. Germany,
for her part, could hardly acquiesce in Charykov’s proposals without
289


1911-12 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 abandoning the generally pro-Turkish policy which she had followed in the Near East for the last two decades. Marschall von Bieberstein,
who feared that if Charykov had his way Russia might acquire in
Turkey a position similar to that she had possessed after the treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi, pointed this out forcefully. The Kaiser’s acceptance of this point of view forced the Chancellor, Bethmann-Hollweg, and the Foreign Secretary, Kiderlen-Wachter, who had at first shown some readiness to support the Russian proposals, to change their attitude. The French government, which was much influenced by its desire to maintain a common front with Britain on the Straits question, did not reply formally to Russia’s advances till early in January 1912, when the whole question had become of merely academic interest, and even then in non-committal terms. AustriaHungary also showed herself unwilling to adopt any clear-cut policy. Charykov’s vague plans for an entente between Turkey and the Balkan states were even more unrealistic than those regarding the Straits. How it was to be brought about he never specified; and the idea of such an entente was opposed not merely by the Balkan governments themselves but also by the Russian ministers to Serbia and Bulgaria, Hartwig and Nekhlyudov, who maintained that these states were interested only in a combination directed against the Turks. Finally on 9 December Sazonov, who had heard of these negotiations only a day or two earlier, forced the abandonment of the whole scheme. In an interview given to Le Matin, one of the most important French newspapers, he denied that Russia contemplated any action at the Straits and stressed that her only interest there was to keep them open to her trade. On the 15th Charykov was ordered to break off his talks with the Turks: in March 1912 he was recalled and sent into retirement. The whole episode was as much an illustration of the incoherence of Russian foreign policy, its lack of any real central plan or direction, as anything else. As the war in Libya dragged on the Italians were forced, in an effort to end it, to take some action against Turkey in Europe. On 18 April 1912 they bombarded two forts guarding the Dardanelles, whereupon the Turks temporarily closed the Straits which they had already mined, arousing much annoyance in neutral states by doing so. There were fears that if Italy attacked the Dardanelles Russia might take the chance to seize the Bosphorus; and an unsuccessful proposal for joint action of this kind was made in St. Petersburg by the Italian government at the end of May. By then Italian forces had occupied the Dodecanese (Austrian opposition kept them from
seizing the islands of the northern Aegean, nearer the Straits) and
290


BEFORE THE FIRST WORLD WAR 1909-12
the war was clearly won. The Turks made peace at last on 15 October by the treaty of Ouchy. This ceded Tripoli to Italy, which was also to remain in ‘temporary’ possession of the Dodecanese. The Italo-Turkish war was a trivial struggle which did Italy’s shaky military reputation more harm than good. But it had important indirect results. It showed that the revolution of 1908-9 had done little to increase the efficiency with which the Ottoman Empire was governed, or even its military strength. It stimulated the territorial ambitions of the Balkan states and their feeling that it should be relatively easy to gratify them at Turkey’s expense. It helped therefore to create the Balkan League of 1912 and to provoke the Balkan Wars which followed. From April 1909 onwards the Serbian government had been making periodic advances to Bulgaria for some form of entente. Fhough the Macedonian problem still divided the two states deeply, serious negotiations were begun in October 1git. By the early spring of 1912 Hartwig and Nekhlyudov, acting like Charykov some months earlier largely on their own initiative, had brought the two governments to the point of signing an alliance. By a treaty of 13 March Serbia and Bulgaria agreed to unite in defence of their independence and integrity and in opposition to any attempt by a great power to invade the Balkan territories of the Ottoman Empire. A secret annexe to the treaty provided that, in case of a joint victory won by the two states over the Turks, Serbia was to have part of northern Macedonia and Bulgaria most of the rest of the province. Ownership of a ‘disputed zone’ was to be decided by Nicholas II of Russia. But this was merely a device for giving Serbia more territory than she was really entitled to, while saving Bulgaria’s face, for it was secretly understood that the Tsar’s decision would favour the Serbs. This alliance was from the start weakened by differences of outlook which divided the signatories. From the Serbian point of view it was a weapon for use against Austria-Hungary as much as against Turkey; the Serbs hoped to gain territory not merely in Macedonia but also on the Adriatic, where the chaos which reigned in Albania seemed to offer them great opportunities. To the Bulgars, however, it was directed entirely against Turkey; already King Ferdinand was dreaming of a triumphal entry into Constantinople. Moreover the agreement to divide Macedonia had been reached only with great difficulty. To the Russian government, whose agents had played a considerable part in creating the alliance, its only function was to block any advance of Austrian influence in the Balkans. There was now little Russian enthusiasm for any further territorial weakening
291


1911-12 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 of Turkey, and in St. Petersburg it was even hoped that she might
eventually be able to join the Serbo—Bulgarian alliance. Already, in
June 1911, the Russian government had compelled King Nicholas of Montenegro to cut off the help he had been giving to the Albanian nationalists against the Porte. In St. Petersburg the Ottoman Empire seemed preferable, as guardian of the Straits, to an enlarged Bulgaria with a German ruler. Largely for this reason a Bulgarian effort to conclude a military convention with Russia in April 1912 had no result. Far from welcoming a Bulgarian capture of Constantinople, the Russian government wished even to keep the Bulgarians out of Adrianople, which it regarded as essential to the defence of the Straits against attack by land. However the Serbo—Bulgarian treaty, insecurely based as it was, at once became the nucleus of a Balkan coalition. Greece, led by the Cretan Eleutherios Venizelos, who was to be overwhelmingly the country’s greatest political figure for the next generation, had been negotiating for an anti-Turkish alliance with Bulgaria since the spring of 1911. In May 1912, thanks partly to the help given by J. B. Bourchier, The Times Balkan correspondent, the negotiations bore fruit in the shape of a treaty strictly defensive in form but in fact intended on both sides to lead to an attack on Turkey. It provided for concerted action by both signatories in favour of the Macedonians and for ‘benevolent neutrality’ on the part of Bulgaria in case of a Greco—Turkish war over Crete. An alliance between Bulgaria and Greece was bound, in the nature of things, to be anti-Turkish; it could never be of much use as a weapon against the Habsburg Empire. For this reason the treaty encountered Russian doubts and suspicions from the moment of its signature. The summer also saw the conclusion of verbal agreements for common action between Greece and Serbia; and between Greece and Montenegro. A military convention was drawn up between Bulgaria and Montenegro in mid-September 1912 but apparently never ratified; one between Montenegro and Serbia was signed at the beginning of October and ratified. Thus by the autumn of 1912 a complex web of alliances and understandings of various degrees of complexity and durability, with its centre at Sofia, bound together all the Balkan states in hostility to Turkey. Armed conflict began with a Montenegrin declaration of war against the Porte on 8 October. The weakest of the Balkan states took the initiative in this way largely because King Nicholas hoped thus to increase the prestige of his dynasty and perhaps help it to replace that of Serbia as the natural leader of the South Slav peoples. He probably hoped also, by a quick victory over the Turks, to face

The Turks could not hope to meet their opponents on equal terms. Their armies were heavily outnumbered by those of the Balkan states and had been weakened by the dismissal in the preceding three years of many officers distrusted by the reformers now dominant in Constantinople. Moreover internal political conflicts in the Ottoman Empire were acute. In July 1912 the Young Turk cabinet led by Said Pasha had been forced to resign, largely by pressure from a group of army officers. The more liberal regime which temporarily succeeded it was hampered and weakened from the start by powerful domestic opponents. By the end of October, defeated by the Bulgars at Kirk-Kilissé and Lule-Burgas, and by the Serbs at Kumanovo, the Turks were falling back towards Constantinople. During the first week of November they were able to halt their retreat at the Chataldja lines covering the capital; but by the end of the month all the rest of their European territory except one or two fortresses had been lost. On 3 December they signed an armistice with the Serbs and Bulgars. By then the attitudes to the war of the different great powers had become more clearly defined. The two most deeply involved were Austria-Hungary and Russia. The Habsburg Empire would have liked best of all a return to the pre-war position. None of its statesmen was sympathetic to a forward policy in the Balkans. In spite of the urgings of military leaders such as General Schemua, who had temporarily succeeded Conrad von Hétzendorff as Chief of Staff, and General Potiorek, the Governor of Bosnia and Herzegovina, they refused to occupy the Sanjak of Novibazar. It was too exposed
to attack, too difficult to garrison; its seizure would merely add to
the South Slav population of the Empire which already gave its
rulers so many nightmares. Moreover the German government was
unwilling to back an adventurous Austrian policy in the Balkans. But
Count Berchtold, who had succeeded Aehrenthal as Foreign Minis
ter, stood firm on one point. Under no circumstances must Serbia be
293


1912 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
allowed to acquire an outlet to the Adriatic, whatever she might win
in Macedonia. If she gained an Adriatic port she would become still
more independent in her attitude to Austria-Hungary. Also such a
port might be used as a base by Russia, which most Serbs still
regarded as their natural protector (this was a very unreal fear) or
might be used by Serbia, in conjunction with Italy, to close the
Adriatic to Austrian shipping. The efforts of Pashich, the Serbian Prime Minister, in secret negotiations in November 1912, to obtain an Adriatic port and a corridor leading to it in return for commercial concessions to Austria, were thus completely unsuccessful. On 22 November the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, accompanied by Schemua, visited Berlin and received an assurance of German support on this point. In his determination to cut Serbia off from the Adriatic Berchtold found an effective tool in the growing national consciousness of the Albanians. An independent Albania seemed the safest and most effective way of preventing the westward expansion of Serbia; and in a note of 30 October to the German government (it was later communicated to the other European powers) he demanded that such a state be created.+ Though the complete victory of nationalism in the Balkans was not for Russia the threat that it was for Austria-Hungary, the defeats suffered by the Turks were almost as unwelcome in St. Petersburg as in Vienna. Sazonov was seriously alarmed by the early successes won by the Bulgarians, which seemed to foreshadow an occupation of Constantinople. In a circular of 2 November he envisaged possible intervention by the great powers to maintain Turkey in possession of the city and its hinterland. If the Turks had failed to hold the Chataldja lines he would have been willing to send the Russian Black Sea squadron to help in the defence of the Turkish capital; and there were proposals from the Navy Ministry that the Bosphorus should be seized. Kokovtsev, the Prime Minister, shared Sazonov’s attitude; while the Tsar agreed that the Russian ambassador at Constantinople should be empowered to summon the Black Sea squadron if this seemed necessary. St. Petersburg therefore turned a deaf ear to the efforts made by Ferdinand of Bulgaria, from December onwards, to obtain the extension of his territory to the Sea of Marmora and possession of the islands of Samothrace and Thasos. It also tried to persuade the British and French governments to propose some form of international mediation which might quickly

As it became clear that the threat to Constantinople was not as imminent as had at first been feared the Russian government increasingly moved away from any idea of intervention. On 9g November Sazonov made it clear that he would not support Serbian claims to an outlet on the Adriatic: this greatly lessened the danger of an Austro—Russian conflict. Moreover two Councils of Ministers held on 3 and 18 December reluctantly decided that Russia was as yet too weak to try conclusions with the Habsburg Empire. Nevertheless the two states maintained large armies on their Galician frontiers for several months to come; and the Austrian military leaders hoped for a war with Russia and had far-reaching plans for one ifit broke out. France made it clear, in a letter of President Poincaré to Izvolskii of 16 November, that she would leave the initiative in the Balkans to Russia.! Italy welcomed the war, which forced the Turks at last to surrender Libya to her. She also agreed with Austria-Hungary in opposing Serbian expansion on the Adriatic, where she had ambitions of her own. In Great Britain opinion was influenced mainly by a desire to aid the creation of an independent Albania and to avoid any interference with trade passing through the Straits. Germany had no very decided line of policy with regard to the war. She still expected the Habsburg Monarchy to give her a lead where Balkan affairs were concerned; and the quiescence of the Austrian government tended to inhibit any effective action by its German ally. Ten days after the armistice of 3 December the ambassadors to Great Britain of the belligerent states met in London to draw up a peace treaty. Four days later a parallel conference of the ambassadors of the great powers also met there. The powers hoped by this means to construct a new settlement in the Balkans and, by preventing the Balkan states from making peace by themselves, to regain control of a situation which for a time appeared to have slipped from their grasp. In fact they achieved very little. It was agreed that Constantinople and the Straits must remain Turkish. There was agree
ment that an independent Albania should be set up, but much

haggling over its frontiers. Austria-Hungary, supported by Germany and Italy, wished to give the new state as much territory as possible, and in particular the town of Scutari. Russia, supported by France and withsomereservations by Britain, wished to be less generous to Albania and thus give rather more territory to Serbia and Greece. Protracted discussion led to no agreement on this point. Nor was any decision taken on the other main territorial issue discussed, the fate of the Greek islands in the Aegean some of which — Imbros, Lemnos, Tenedos and Samothrace — commanded the entrance to the Dardanelles. This deadlock in London was broken by events in Constantinople. On 23 January 1913 the Young Turks, led by Enver Bey, drove from power the short-lived liberal regime. On the 30th they rejected the conditions which the powers proposed to inflict on them and war broke out once more. The few fortresses which were all that remained of Turkey’s possessions in Albania and Macedonia soon fell; and on 24 March Adrianople itself was taken by a combined Serb and Bulgarian army. By the end of May the exhausted Ottoman Empire had been forced to sign peace preliminaries at London by which it ceded to its Balkan antagonists all its possessions in Europe west of a line from Enos to Midia, except Albania and the Greek islands whose fate was to be decided by the great powers. During this second phase of the struggle the preoccupations of the latter had centred around the same two dominant issues as before Russian determination that the Turks should retain Constantinople and Austrian insistence on creating an independent Albania and giving it as much territory as possible. The Russian attitude was made clear once more when on 31 March Sazonov threatened to send the Russian Black Sea squadron to protect Constantinople if the Bulgars should force the Chataldja lines; but as no really acute threat to the Turkish capital developed he was never called on to make good this threat. Albanian complications gave the powers more trouble. The most critical issue with which the conference of ambassadors in London was faced was that of Scutari. It had already been agreed that this town should go to Albania; yet when it was captured by the Montenegrin army on 22 April after a long siege! King Nicholas threatened to annex it. Already at the beginning of April Britain, France, Germany, Austria and Italy had had to send warships to Antivari, the main port of Montenegro, to force the Montenegrins to abandon their bombardment of Scutari;? and only

heavy pressure by the powers, culminating in a threat of direct
military action by Austria, compelled Nicholas, on 4 May, to
renounce his claims to the city. By the end of July 1913 the new
state of Albania had achieved legal existence and, in theory at least, a rudimentary administrative structure. It was agreed that her neutrality should be guaranteed by the powers and that she should be ruled by a prince whom they would select. (A German, Prince William of Wied, was chosen.) Order was to be maintained by a gendarmerie with officers drawn from some traditionally neutral state (Dutchmen were eventually appointed) and an international commission was to organise the administrative system. Russia was able to deprive the new state of some small areas on its eastern frontier (mainly the villages of Dibra and Djakova, which were acquired by Serbia) but its southern boundary with Greece was in many ways favourable to it. It was generally understood that Greece, in return, would be allowed to keep most of the Aegean islands she had taken from the Turks. The establishment of Albania was the last important achievement of the Habsburg Empire in international affairs and one of the most constructive of its long history. Long before the armistice of 30 May had been signed new threats to the peace of the Balkans had appeared. Almost from the beginning of the war Rumania, which had played no part in it, had shown herself anxious to profit from the defeat of the Turks. As early as October 1912 she had begun to claim from Bulgaria ‘compensation’ for the latter’s conquests. On 17 December 1912 she demanded a rectification of her southern frontier, and in particular the cession to her of the fortress of Silistria, whose population was purely Bulgarian. By January 1913 her government was contemplating the forcible seizure, without any declaration of war, of the territory it claimed. By early in May Bulgaria was prepared to cede Silistria with a small surrounding territory; but Rumanian opinion rejected this as too miserly. Even more serious, the anti-Turkish coalition was clearly on the point of collapse. The Serbian government was anxious to repudiate its treaty of March 1912 with Bulgaria, the foundationstone of the whole Balkan alliance, and to retain most of Macedonia. This was indefensible in terms of the nationality of its inhabitants. But the Serbian government could argue that it had sent more troops
to help the Bulgars in the fighting around Adrianople than it was
obliged to do by the treaty, while Bulgaria had not sent the forces
she had promised to help the Serbs in the Vardar valley. Moreover
Serbia could assert that she had some moral claim to compensation
for the disappointment of her hopes of an Adriatic outlet. Greece for
297


1913 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
her part was now completely estranged from Bulgaria by an intense rivalry over Salonika. The Greek soldiers who captured the great Aegean port on 9 November 1912 forestalled by only a few hours a Bulgarian force with the same objective. Henceforth the city, and with it the coastline of southern Macedonia, was the object of bitter disputes; in March and again in May sporadic fighting broke out between Greek and Bulgarian forces in the Struma valley. Inherent in the situation, therefore, was a tendency for Serbia and Greece to combine against Bulgaria. As early as January 1913 the Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia and Prince Nicholas of Greece had met at Salonika and discussed an alliance to meet a possible Bulgarian attack on either of their states. On 1 June (only a day after the Turks had agreed to an armistice) a Serbo—Greek treaty was signed. By this each signatory promised to support the other with 150,000 men against attack by a third power. It also defined the frontiers the two states would demand in case of a successful war with Bulgaria; and both signatories began almost at once to make advances to Turkey for her support. A meeting at Tsaribrod, on the Serb-Bulgarian frontier, between Pashich and Gueshov, the Serbian and Bulgarian Prime Ministers, seemed to hold out some hope of a peaceful settlement of the differences between the two countries; but it was followed only a few days later by the fall of Gueshov and his replacement by the more extreme Danev. The position of the Bulgarian government was now extremely difficult. It saw the isolation of the country and the hostility of its neighbours. But it was under heavy pressure from the large and active groups of Macedonian émigrés in Bulgaria not to give way to Greek or Serb demands. Russia, realising the danger of the situation, pressed the states concerned to accept her mediation; but King Ferdinand and Danev were threatened with assassination if they accepted the offer. Moreover discontent was now running high in the Bulgarian army, which wished either to fight for Macedonia or to be demobilised at once (the peasant conscripts who made up its rank and file were already deserting in considerable numbers). General Savov, its Commander-in-Chief, now took the lead with disastrous results for the country. On 11 June he rejected the proposed Russian mediation; on the 15th he urged the occupation of the whole of Macedonia; on the 21st he demanded that within ten days the government should decide either to fight or to demobilise. The ministers in Sofia gave way; and on the night of the 29th-goth a surprise attack was launched against the Serbs. It was an utter failure. A series of battles around Bregalnitsa in the first week of July ended in victory for the Serbian army, while the Greeks overran Thrace up to the river

As far as the great powers and the European balance were concerned the second Balkan War was above all a defeat for Austria-Hungary. By the spring of 1913 the attitude of the Austrian government had become strongly favourable to Bulgaria and Conrad had even urged a military alliance with her. On 24 June, when war was obviously imminent, Berchtold had impressed on the Austrian minister in Sofia that ‘in view of the open hostility
of Serbia towards us, a further material and moral strengthening of
Serbia at the expense of Bulgaria would be absolutely contrary to our
interests.’! Yet this further strengthening of Serbia had taken place;
and Austria, though her attitude was consistently pro-Bulgarian, did
nothing effective to prevent it. This was partly because of the 1B, C. Helmreich, The Diplomacy of the Balkan Wars (Cambridge, Mass., 1938),

second-rateness of her leaders and the fact that they were by no means united on the Balkan policy to be followed by the Dual Monarchy. It was also partly because Rumania was still, at least on paper, an ally of Austria-Hungary as she had been since 1883; and it was difficult to support Bulgaria against the Serbs without also strengthening her against the Rumanians. Above all, perhaps, it was because neither of the Monarchy’s possible allies, Germany and

Italy, showed any enthusiasm, or in the case of Italy even any
willingness, to help it in the Balkans. Bethmann-Hollweg, German Chancellor since the dismissal of Biilow in July 1909, was less sympathetic to the nationalities problem of the Habsburg Empire than some of his predecessors, while the strengthening of the Turkish position in Europe by the recapture of Adrianople was generally welcomed in Germany. Moreover William II was the brother-in-law of the King of Greece; and German policy in 1912-13 was therefore generally favourable to Greece (except to some extent over the question of the Aegean islands, where Greek and Turkish interests directly conflicted and where German desires for a strong Turkey came into play).1 German statesmen had no particular love for Serbia; but the settlement of 1913 was from their point of view a fairly satisfactory one. As for Italy, she made it clear that she had no intention of intervening actively in the Balkans. An Austrian effort to invoke the Triple Alliance against Serbia drew on g July from Giolitti, the Italian Prime Minster, merely the response that the casus foederts envisaged by the alliance had not arisen, since Austria had not been attacked, and that a war against Serbia would be an aggressive not a defensive one. Austria thus had to acquiesce in the strengthening of Serbia by the treaty of Bucharest. But she did so grudgingly; and her rulers had not yet abandoned hope of weakening the position which the Serbs had so suddenly acquired. In October they forced Serbia, by an ultimatum, to withdraw her troops from Albanian territory, some of which they had occupied as a result of the chaotic condition of that country. The Austrian government also encouraged as far as it could the talks between the Bulgarian and Turkish governments which went on intermittently in the later months of 1913 and early 1914 and which more than once seemed likely to lead to an alliance between the two states. It steadily opposed all suggestions of a union of Serbia and Montenegro (the unpopularity of King Nicholas, who had assumed the royal title as recently as August 1910, made this idea rather attractive to many Montenegrins) and urged Italy to oppose them also. But the clock could not be turned back. Serbia was now, for the first time in her history, in a position to resist
1 The best illustration of the generally pro-Greek attitude of Germany is the
support which, backed by France, she gave to Greek claims to Kavalla during the
peace negotiations at Bucharest. The conflicting Bulgarian claim to the city was
supported by Austria and Russia, since both for different reasons wished to
strengthen Bulgaria—Austria as a check on the power of Serbia, and Russia because
she feared that Greece might otherwise soon threaten Turkey’s control of the
Straits by attempting to resurrect the Byzantine Empire with Constantinople as its capital.

1913-14 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 effectively pressure from either the Habsburg Empire or Russia. The treaty of Bucharest left unsettled a number of irritating and potentially dangerous questions. In particular it did not solve the problem of the Aegean islands which Greece had taken from Turkey during the first Balkan War; and by the early months of 1914 another Greco-Turkish struggle over them seemed imminent. But the frontiers drawn by the treaty in Macedonia and Thrace proved remarkably durable (much more so than those laid down in and after 1878). Apart from Bulgaria’s loss in 1919 of her outlet to the Aegean they were not drastically altered even by the two world wars. Serbia was not alone among the Balkan states in having her attitude to international affairs and to the great powers altered by the war. Bulgaria, embittered by defeat, felt that Austria-Hungary alone had made any effort to protect her interests. She therefore tended to draw closer to the Habsburg Empire and thus to some extent to the Habsburgs’ German ally. In the autumn of 1913 she accepted a German loan in preference to one offered her by a group of French banks, while the government, now headed by Radoslavov, began to explore the possibilities of an alliance with the Central Powers. Rumania, on the other hand, was now moving towards the entente side in European affairs. Her ruling family was German, much German money was invested in the country, and she still deeply disliked and distrusted Russia. But the existence of a great Rumanian population in Transylvania under increasingly oppressive Hungarian rule made it impossible for her ever to co-operate wholeheartedly with the Habsburg Monarchy, especially as Count Stephen Tisza, the Hungarian Prime Minister and the strongest man in the politics of the Monarchy, was an uncompromising Magyar nationalist. Moreover the diplomatic support Austria had given to Bulgaria in the second Balkan War increased the dislike felt for the Habsburgs in Bucharest. Count Czernin, the newlyappointed Austrian ambassador there, reported in December 1913 that the Austro—-Rumanian alliance of 1883 ‘is not worth the paper and ink with which it is written’; and the state visit of Nicholas II to Rumania in June 1914 was widely taken to mean that the country had now gone over to the Franco—Russian camp in international affairs. Most important of all, the wars of 1912-13 did a good deal to strengthen German influence at Constantinople. The Young Turks who had seized power after the coup d’état of January 1913 were for the most part pro-German. Enver, the brave but unbalanced officer who was the most striking figure amongst them, had been military attaché in Berlin and was a great admirer of German strength and

In fact von Sanders had asked for the post in question for military,
not political or strategic, reasons. He believed that holding it would

help him to overcome conservative resistance to the reforms he wished to introduce in the training of the Turkish army; and there is no evidence that his action was inspired or influenced by the German government. As early as 20 December 1913 Bethmann-Hollweg had told Sverbeev, the Russian ambassador in Berlin, that Germany might make concessions to the Russian point of view, though this would have to be done carefully because of the excited state of German public opinion. In January 1914, therefore, a face-saving solution to the difficulty was found. Von Sanders was given accelerated promotion to the rank of a full General of Cavalry in the German army. This automatically made him a Turkish FieldMarshal (the agreement of November 1913 had provided that members of the mission were to hold a Turkish rank one degree higher than their German one) and therefore too senior to command a mere Army Corps. He was thus removed from the command of the Constantinople garrison to become Inspector-General of the Turkish army without any obvious surrender by Germany or Turkey to Russian pressure. Simultaneously, however, Enver became War Minister. German influence in Turkey was becoming greater rather than less. The Liman von Sanders crisis did a good deal to envenom Russo—German relations. It stimulated in St. Petersburg, in a ministerial conference held on 21 February 1913, the most serious discussion since 1895 of the possibility of seizing the Straits by force. The conference reluctantly decided that the superiority of the Turkish fleet, lack of suitable transport vessels and the inadequacy of the military forces Russia could make available rendered such a coup de main impracticable. Moreover it was argued very forcibly that a seizure of the Straits was impossible except as part of a general European war; and that in such a war victory or defeat for Russia, and hence her chances of acquiring control of the Straits, would depend solely on the performance of her armies on the western front. The conference agreed none the less to increase the land forces earmarked for a possible attack on the Bosphorus and to strengthen the Black Sea fleet.1 The crisis of 1913-14 also forced Russia to draw closer than before to Britain and France and placed her at something of a disadvantage in dealing with them where Near Eastern affairs were concerned, since German control of the Straits would damage Russia far more than the other members of the Triple Entente. By June 1914 Sazonov was ready to surrender to Britain the neutral zone of Persia, created by the entente of 1907, to
? The very interesting discussions at this conference are conveniently summarised in Bovykin, op. cit., pp. 141-43; and in Mandelstam, loc. cit., pp. 757-59.

The acuteness of this antagonism and the dangers it involved for the peace of Europe were increased by the activities of the Pan—Serb and South Slav political societies which came into existence in both Serbia and Bosnia during the years before 1914. One of the most important of these, the Narodna Odbrana (National Defence), was founded in Belgrade two days after the Austrian annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and as a reply to it. It had from the first an official character —a number of Serbian ministers, generals and high officials were founder-members — and its life as a genuinely revolutionary group aiming at the union of the South Slavs by direct action was short. From 1909 onwards, largely as result of Austrian protests against its activities, it became a more or less open and relatively moderate organisation. Side by side with it, however, there grew up the powerful terrorist group known as Ujedinenje ili Smrt (Union or Death) or Crna Ruka (Black Hand). This was founded in May 1911 and may have had 2,500 members by 1914, including a small number from the South Slavs of the Habsburg Empire as well as many from Serbia. Most of them were dedicated and carefullychosen men, especially those from the Habsburg territories who probably never numbered more than about thirty. The Serb members included a large number of officers who had taken part in the revolution of 1903; and the society’s relations with the Serbian government were always rather ambiguous. Pashich and _ his colleagues disliked and feared these violent extremists. The government was narrowly Panserb in sympathy rather than South Slav, and felt, with much justification, that Serbia had already seen too much military interference in politics. But it dared not suppress the society — this would be unpopular and might well expose the ministers concerned to assassination — and allowed it to set up near Nisha training-school for guerrillas and saboteurs. The ministers tried merely to keep Ujedinenje i Smrt under observation. Milan Chiga
novich, an important member of the society, was also one of Pashich’s
agents, and had probably been planted in it to keep the government
informed of its doings. Lite
By the summer of 1914 Ujedinenye il Smrt, after some preliminary
successes, was ready for its biggest coup so far — the murder of the
Archduke Francis Ferdinand, the heir to the Habsburg throne,
which was successfully carried out in Sarajevo on 28 June. He was
singled out for its attentions because he appeared to sympathise with
o°5


1914 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 the idea of giving the South Slav inhabitants of the empire, or at least the Croats, a political status similar to that enjoyed since 1867 by the Germans and Magyars. Whether this scheme could ever have been carried out is highly doubtful. It would certainly have been violently opposed by the Magyars, who had many Serbs, Croats and Slovenes under their rule; and Tisza and his followers would not have hesitated to break up the fragile structure of the empire in defence of Magyar interests. Moreover Francis Ferdinand looked on the Slavs of the empire merely as a weapon against the Magyars whom he loathed; he had no interest in them for their own sakes. But the South Slav extremists could not risk the accession of an Emperor who might, by appeasing his South Slav subjects, delay or even prevent the creation of a united South Slav state. As his assassin, Gavrilo Princip, said at his trial, Francis Ferdinand was killed because ‘as future Sovereign he would have prevented our union and carried out certain reforms which would have been clearly against our interests’. The connection of the Serbian government with the assassination was unpleasantly close — much closer than was realised at the time. The murder was planned by the leading figure in Ujedinenje tli Smrt, Colonel Dragutin Dimitrievich, who had, since the previous year, been head of the Intelligence Department of the Serbian General Staff. Moreover the group of young men (five of the six assassins were between 16 and 20) who had been detailed to kill the Archduke were helped by Serbian customs officials to cross the frontier into Bosnia. Pashich, who knew through General Jankovich, the President of the Narodna Odbrana, that a group of armed men had crossed the frontier, and who wished to avoid complications with Austria, tried unsuccessfully to prevent their reaching Habsburg territory. Failing in this, he then attempted to warn the Austrian government that an attempt on the Archduke’s life might be made. Early in June Jovanovich, the Serbian minister in Vienna, mentioned the matter to Bilinski, the Austrian Minister of Finance who was responsible for the administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Unfortunately the warning was vague and rather misleading in its terms and little attention was paid to it. Dimitrievich himself, after being interrogated by members of the Serbian government, tried to prevent the assassination ; and by one of the more remarkable ironies of history the Central Executive Committee of Ujeninenje ili Smrt, when it met on 14 June, turned down the idea of an attempt on the Archduke’s life. But by then the murderers had reached Bosnia and

The events of the five weeks which followed the Sarajevo tragedy have been described more frequently and in far greater detail than those of any comparable period in modern history. They were dominated by the forces of European politics, and finally by those of strategic advantage and military necessity, rather than by Near Eastern considerations. One of the roots of the First World War lay in the Balkans; but it had several others and its outbreak need merely be outlined here. It seemed at first possible that the murder of the Archduke would not lead even to a localised Austro-Serbian war. Many of the political leaders of Austro—Hungary were now ready to believe that only a successful attack on Serbia could keep the Monarchy, increasingly torn apart by its insoluble nationalities problem, from rapid collapse. Berchtold himself wished to avoid war and co-operate with Russia in the Balkans; but the death of Francis Ferdinand, who also wished to improve relations with Russia, greatly weakened his position, In particular Conrad von Hétzendorff, who had been reappointed Chief of the General Staff in 1912 after the death of Aehrenthal, pressed very strongly for war. On the other hand Tisza wished above all to complete the process of forcible Magyarisation of the Serbs, Slovenes and Rumanians which had been in progress in the eastern half of the empire for nearly half a century. He was therefore very reluctant to saddle the Hungarians with more discontented Slavs to rule and strongly opposed to war. Not until 23 July was the Austrian ultimatum which led to conflict delivered in
Belgrade.? In the meantime William II and Bethmann-Hollweg had
1V, Dedijer, ‘Sarajevo Fifty Years After,’ Foreign Affairs, July 1964, p. 578.
2 This delay, however, was partly because the French President and Prime
Minister, Poincaré and Viviani, were visiting St. Petersburg during the 20th—23rd.
It was believed in Vienna that Franco—Russian co-operation would be hampered
if the ultimatum were delivered while the French statesmen were at sea on their way home.

1914 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
given, on 5 July, general assurances of support to the Austrian government; but it is clear that neither of them really expected a European war. Russia, they thought, was still too weak to go to such lengths in defence of Serbia. Berchtold also was thinking of war, if at all, in terms of a short successful struggle with the Serbs alone. Nevertheless in both Vienna and Berlin it was increasingly felt that if a European war were inevitable it should be fought as soon as possible, before economic growth and strategic railway-building allowed Russia properly to arm and deploy her great reserves of manpower. In fact the Russian government, though it had wished if possible to postpone the struggle at least until 1917, was now making up its mind that it would not allow Serbia to be crushed. On the 21st Sazonov gave the German ambassador in St. Petersburg a warning to this effect. These diplomatic preliminaries in Berlin and St. Petersburg, on which Berchtold insisted, were rapidly ruining the chance of a successful surprise attack on Serbia, such as Conrad had envisaged. The principal demands contained in the Austrian ultimatum to Serbia of 23 July were for a formal abandonment by the Serbian government of South Slav irredentist ambitions and the breaking-up of the Narodna Odbrana.1 These were no more than the facts of Serbian complicity in the Sarajevo murder justified, though as yet these facts were largely unknown; but the ultimatum was never intended to be more than a formal prelude to conflict. A conciliatory reply from Belgrade two days later was rejected and Austria declared war on Serbia on the 28th. She thus deliberately frustrated British attempts to organise mediation by the other great powers and overrode the feeble and confused attempts which the German government was now, at the last moment, making to restrain her. The only future now open to the Dual Monarchy was that of a military struggle for survival. Her fate lay henceforth in the hands of soldiers — her own and those of her allies. With the outbreak of fighting diplomatic considerations were overwhelmed by military ones. Partial mobilisation began in Russia on the 25th; general mobilisation was declared, after some hesitation by the Tsar, on the 31st. This was the most serious step of all. The German General Staff insisted that Russia must not be allowed to deploy her army in full strength while Germany remained inactive; this would nullify one of Germany’s main advantages in the early stages of a war — her ability to mobilise more rapidly and efficiently
1 The Austrian government, very badly informed, did not differentiate clearly between the relatively harmless Varodna Odbrana and the much more dangerous Ujedinenje ili Smrt.
308


BEFORE THE FIRST WORLD WAR 1914
than her great neighbour. The German military leaders had already been pressing for mobilisation; and a German ultimatum to St. Petersburg now demanded that Russian war preparations be halted. A German declaration of war on Russia followed next day. But the German war plan, the so-called Schlieffen plan, was based on the assumption of a war with Russia and France simultaneously, a war which was to be won first of all in the west by a rapid march through Belgium, the envelopment of the French left wing and the capture of Paris. To this set of assumptions all German strategic planning was geared; no alternative plan existed and this one alone promised quick and decisive victory. The soldiers, now in the ascendant in Berlin, carried out the only scheme of operations they had, even though it was realised that a march through Belgium would probably mean British intervention. They encountered no significant opposition from Bethmann-Hollweg. A war with France was quickly engineered. An ultimatum of 31 July demanded her neutrality in the approaching Russo—German struggle. It was rejected and was meant to be rejected. War between France and Germany began, after a short delay, on 3 August. German troops had invaded Luxemburg on the previous day and the invasion of Belgium followed. This allowed Britain, whose policy in the crisis had hitherto been cautious and non-committal,! to combine moral principle, which demanded that as a signatory of the treaty of London of 1839 she should defend Belgian neutrality, with political interest, which demanded that she oppose German domination of Europe. An ultimatum demanding that the invasion of Belgium be halted was presented in Berlin. Its rejection was followed by a British declaration of war on Germany on 4 August.
1 Inevitably so, since active intervention in the struggle would have been
rejected by an overwhelming majority of the cabinet and both Houses of Parliament.

COROT MAIS ABALADDNS
The War of 1914-18
THE immediate causes of the war lay in the Balkans, in the growth of Serbia and of pan-Serb and South Slav feelings and the threat they offered to Austria-Hungary. It was thus clear from the start that, while the major battles would be fought in other parts of the continent, in France, Poland and East Prussia, the political repercussions of the struggle on the still neutral states of south-eastern Europe would be very important. No Balkan state possessed a first-class army and none could sustain a war for very long without help in money and arms from one of the greater powers. Nevertheless the support, or even the benevolent neutrality, of any one of them was a prize which neither side could afford to despise. Greece, with her long sea coast and large merchant marine; Bulgaria, with her central position between Serbia, Greece, Turkey and Rumania; above all Turkey with her control of the Straits and ability to threaten the Suez Canal, occupied strategic positions of importance. Rumania and Turkey possessed, or appeared to possess, resources in raw materials which might be of immense value to the belligerents and whose importance to the central powers was soon to be greatly increased by the allied blockade. Moreover in a purely military sense some of these states were far from negligible. The Greek army had been humiliatingly defeated in 1897 and had not particularly distinguished itself in 1912-13. That of Rumania had also few victories to boast of. But the Serbs, Bulgars and Turks had all at various times in the,recent past shown that, properly led and equipped, they were excellent fighting material. Few people anywhere in Europe in August and September 1914 expected the war to last very long. As yet no belligerent was willing to make major concessions to win allies in the Balkans. But from the outbreak of the struggle, and even in the last days of peace, there can be seen developing a competition for the support of the Balkan states. This ended by involving the whole area in the war and sharpening the antagonisms which already divided it. The first and most important trial of strength between Entente

All this did not mean that Turkey was ready to enter the war at once on the side of the central powers. Someof her leaders, notably Djemal, still tended to favour the entente states. Her army was in poor condition and the country was weakened by the wars it had
fought in the previous three years. The majority of both cabinet and
people were in favour of neutrality.1 The result was that throughout
August and September the government flirted with both sides while committing itself irrevocably to neither.
Nevertheless the very first days of the war showed the strength of 1 At least where Britain and France were concerned. War with Russia alone would have been much more popular.
e141


1914 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
the forces making for alliance with Germany. By a secret agreement
of 2 August the Turkish government promised to enter the conflict
on the side of the central powers if Russia intervened in the AustroSerb struggle which had already broken out. If Greece should side with the entente powers the Turks were to recover the Aegean islands, including Crete. This agreement did not mean Turkey’s immediate entry into the struggle. Germany could give the Turks little protection against the British and French pressure in the Mediterranean to which their adherence to the central powers would expose them, or even against attack by Greece or Bulgaria supported by the entente states. Of this the Turkish ministers were well aware. Even while the treaty of 2 August was being negotiated Enver, apparently on his own initiative, approached Giers, the Russian ambassador at Constantinople, offering him the alliance of Turkey in return for a rectification of Balkan frontiers which would give her western Thrace and the Aegean islands. This proposal was probably not sincerely meant: in any event it had no success. No allied leader was anxious to buy the alliance of Turkey at the expense of the Balkan states. In particular Sazonov was now basing his near eastern policy on the creation of a Balkan bloc like that of 1912 which was to be directed against Austria-Hungary. He therefore temporised, in spite of the urgings of Giers that Enver’s proposals be accepted at once. Nevertheless he realised that Turkish hostility and a resulting closure of the Straits would severely weaken Russia’s position and was anxious to keep the Turks neutral until the entente powers had decisively beaten their opponents. He therefore suggested on 16 August a joint guarantee by Russia, Britain and France of Turkish neutrality and territorial integrity. The Capitulations, increasingly felt by many Turks as an unbearable humiliation, might be modified. The concessions granted to German enterprises in the Ottoman Empire might be resumed by the Turkish government; and it might also recover the island of Lemnos, Greece being compensated by the acquisition of Epirus. This proposal led to nothing. The Turks replied merely by a demand for further concessions. The guarantee of their neutrality must be given in writing. The Capitulations must be abolished, not merely modified. Two battleships which were being built in Britain for the Turkish navy and which the British government had commandeered (thus deeply antagonising much Turkish opinion) must be restored. The allies must renounce interference in Turkish affairs and promise her western Thrace if Bulgaria sided with the central powers. The Aegean islands must also be recovered by the Porte. The Russian proposal and the uncompromising Turkish response
312


THE WAR OF 1914-18 1914
to it led to the first important demonstration of the disunity which was to plague the diplomacy of the entente powers throughout the war. Russia, whose economic interests in the Ottoman Empire were relatively slight, was willing to make large concessions over the Capitulations. France, whose commercial and above all financial stake in the Near East was very large, was quite unwilling to abandon them unless some adequate substitute could be put in their place. Moreover the French government wished to create a Balkan bloc aimed against Turkey and had no intention of paying heavily for Turkish support. The British cabinet, for its part, was completely unwilling to hand over to the Turks the two commandeered warships. Its attitude was dominated by the escape into Turkish waters of two German men-of-war, the battleship Goeben and the light cruiser Breslau, which had been cruising in the Mediterranean at the outbreak of war. Pursued by much superior British forces, they had taken refuge at Constantinople by 10 August. Turkey’s reception of them was a breach of neutrality; and during the weeks which followed Britain pressed repeatedly and unsuccessfully for their internment and the repatriation of their crews. They were to play an important part in the events of the next two months. The attitudes of the entente powers thus differed considerably. It was their disunity as much as the rigidity of the Turkish government which stultified Sazonov’s initiative. They returned to the attack on go August with a new proposal on similar lines to that of a fortnight earlier; but reports of a great German victory in France, which seemed to foreshadow an early end to the war, destroyed any chance that the Turks might accept it. By the beginning of September it was becoming clear that the Ottoman Empire was moving steadily towards alliance with the central powers. The details of the process are difficult to disentangle, since it depended so much upon the attitudes and interrelations of a few dominant personalities and little reliable evidence for these exists. Certainly there was never a majority in the Turkish Chamber, or probably in the cabinet, in favour of war. But the movement towards war is unmistakable. On 11 August it was announced that the Goeben and Breslau had been sold to Turkey and incorporated, with their German crews, in the Turkish navy in place of the battleships seized by the British government. The sale was a pure formality, as even members of the Turkish government admitted. A few days later the German Admiral Souchon replaced the British Admiral Limpus in command of the Turkish
fleet. On g September the British naval mission in Turkey was
dismissed. Simultaneously the Capitulations were denounced: the
central powers as well as those of the entente protested against this
3t3


1914 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
breach of Turkey’s treaty obligations but allowed the Porte to know
that they regarded this as a mere formality. The closing of foreign
post-offices and the placing of foreign schools under Turkish control
soon followed; and on 27 September, when it became clear that
Britain would not permit Turkish warships to leave the Straits,
Enver ordered their closure to foreign shipping. The Austrian and
German ambassadors were now pressing strongly for action by the
Turks against the entente powers; and on 11 October Enver and the
Minister of the Interior, Talaat Bey, pledged themselves to enter the
war on the German side in return for a substantial loan to Turkey. By this time, moreover, Djemal, hitherto the main Turkish supporter of the entente, had accepted the idea of action against Russia. It is just possible that Turkish involvement in the war might yet have been avoided. A majority of the cabinet, including the Grand Vizier, Said Halim Pasha, was still in favour of neutrality and knew little of the manoeuvres of the war party. But the incoherence of the Young Turk regime and the failure of the peace party to produce any leader of comparable stature to Enver were fatal. Finally Souchon forced the government’s hand. On 28 October he led a powerful Turkish squadron, with which he had been sent on manoeuvres in the Black Sea, in an attack on the Russian ports of Feodosia, Odessa and Novorossisk. Several of the Turkish ministers were fully aware of his intention to act in this way and orders to attack the Russian Black Sea coast had in fact been given to him by Enver on the 25th. War was now inevitable. In an effort to stave it off some members of the Turkish cabinet approached the entente ministers in Constantinople with an offer of an enquiry into what had happened; but in vain. They were no longer masters in their own house and were unable to comply with the only terms which could satisfy the entente — the immediate dismissal of all German soldiers and sailors in Turkey. Giers left Constantinople on the 31st. By 5 November Britain, France and Russia had all declared war on the Ottoman Empire, Britain had proclaimed the annexation of
Cyprus and an allied squadron had bombarded the outer forts of the
Dardanelles. On the following day British troops sent from India
landed in Mesopotamia.

THE WAR OF 1914-18 1914-17 Moreover the price of failure, superimposed on the losses of the past few years, might well be her disappearance as a state of any significance. The creation of an independent Armenia and independent or autonomous Arab principalities, which were likely results of defeat, would reduce her to little more than an Anatolian puppet-state. ‘For Turkey her entry into the war was a question of to be or not to be, far more than for us others’, wrote Field-Marshal von Hindenburg after the struggle was over.! Nor were her armies in general well or even sensibly led. She possessed some excellent officers; but Enver as Minister of War showed till his fall in the very last days of the conflict a striking lack of realism and failure to understand how limited the country’s resources were. Pan-Turkish and Panislamic ideas diverted his attention from the essential task of protecting the empire against the powerful enemies it had so rashly acquired to grandiose and futile dreams of expansion in the Caucasus, Persia and central Asia. In December 1914 he told Liman von Sanders that after victory in the Caucasus he might march through Afghanistan to India. In fact, early in January 1915, the army which he was leading in person against the Russians suffered at Sarykamysh the most complete defeat inflicted on any belligerent during the war. Until the last moments of the struggle his undoubted courage and energy were used to weaken and impoverish his country. Not until a year later did any other Balkan state enter the war. Bulgaria joined the central powers in October 1915. Rumania joined the anti-German alliance in August 1916. Greece, after many and humiliating vacillations, was forced by British and French pressure to join the entente powers in July 1917. All these states had large territorial ambitions which they hoped to gratify at the expense of each other, or at that of Turkey, Austria-Hungary or Albania. Yet all their governments showed (in contrast to that of Turkey) remarkable caution in their attempts to realise these ambitionsTh.is was because it was essential that, if they entered the war at all, they should do so on the winning side. Whatever promises might be made them, whatever threats offered them, they would take no irrevocable step till the balance of military success seemed to have swung decisively in favour of one side or the other. They would then join the victors on the best terms obtainable. They were willing to intervene actively in the war only when, as they thought, they could profit without running any serious risk. Their policies were thus dictated by military events, by the movement of armies, far more than by the diplomacy of the belligerents.? In the event, their

1914-17 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 calculations proved remarkably inaccurate. Bulgaria in 1915 and Rumania in the following year mistook temporary though important successes for decisive victories; while in 1917 the Greek government had the issue settled for it by force majeure. Nevertheless these calculations were being made and revised from the moment war broke out. They explain the atmosphere of cowardice, greed and vacillation which overhangs Balkan politics in these years. The small and weak states of the area could not afford to be on the losing side and therefore could not afford courageous or clearcut policies. It was also essential for them, before committing themselves, to secure definite promises of territorial and other gains and if possible to raise their price by making both groups of belligerents compete for their support. At the end of 1914 a well-informed British observer complained that ‘the example of Romania during the Balkan War has up till now hypnotised neutral states, who think that they have only got to wait with their jaws well apart for cities, provinces and whole countries to drop in’. But bold and honourable policies are luxuries which small states have rarely been able to afford in wartime, especially in the twentieth century. In the early months of the war Russia was the only member of the Triple Entente to devote much attention to the Balkans. AustriaHungary even more than Germany was the enemy whom she wished to destroy; and a combination of Balkan states under her leadership offered an obvious way of striking at Habsburg power. It could also be used to support Serbia, for which many Russians felt a very real concern and responsibility. To Britain and France on the other hand Germany was the real, indeed the only enemy. Neither their governments nor their public opinions felt much antagonism towards the Habsburg Empire; and their generals believed firmly and probably correctly that Germany could be decisively defeated only on the western front. In London and Paris the Balkans seemed remote and unimportant. No one as yet expected them to become, apart from the fighting between Austria-Hungary and Serbia, a major theatre of war. Until well into 1915, therefore, Russia set the pace of entente diplomacy in the Near East. To Rumania she showed herself remarkably generous. In the last days of July 1914 Sazonov had offered Bratianu (the Rumanian Prime Minister and for the next two years the dominant figure in the
country’s political life) Transylvania in return for Rumanian support
in the war which was obviously imminent. The offer was not
accepted. Bratianu was soon demanding a promise of the province
in exchange for mere neutrality, while the German ambassador *R. Storrs, Orientations (London, 1945), p. 144.

1914 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
Bulgaria’s policy during the first months of the war was as
cautious as that of Rumania. In spite of German and Austrian efforts
to win her over to the central powers she declared on 12 August her
intention to maintain the strictest neutrality. Her Prime Minister, Radoslavov, was Bratianu’s equal in selfishness and opportunism. But there was one crucial difference in the attitudes of the two countries. Rumania’s fundamental aim was the acquisition of Transylvania and this required the defeat of Austria~Hungary. Her attitude, if not openly favourable to the entente states, was thus at bottom hostile to the central powers. Bulgaria’s territorial ambitions, on the other hand, centred on the acquisition of all Macedonia and particularly on the recovery of the large part of it taken from her by Serbia in 1913. Though she was more than once offered territory in Macedonia by Russia in return for her support, proposals of this kind came much more convincingly from the profoundly antiSerbian statesmen of Austria-Hungary. Russophil elements and traditions were still strong in Sofia; but the logic of Bulgaria’s position as well as the considerable influence of her ambitious German ruler tended to draw her towards the central powers. On 6 September 1914 she signed a treaty with Austria-Hungary by which she agreed to support the latter if she were attacked by some new enemy (e.g. Rumania). In return Austria-Hungary promised to aid Bulgaria against any attack. Nevertheless Sazonov was very anxious to appease the sense of grievance left in Bulgaria by the events of 1913 and to make use of her against the Habsburgs and Turkey. Her accession to the entente cause would greatly strengthen the position of Serbia, otherwise so isolated and so vulnerable. It would also, by freeing Greece from anxiety about her northern frontier, make it much easier to persuade her to join the anti-German powers. From the first days of the war, therefore, he urged these two states to promise Bulgaria the Macedonian territory she demanded. Neither, it goes without saying, was willing to do this. Pashich agreed on 1 September, after bitter resistance, to cede part of western Macedonia to Bulgaria; but this would be done only after the victory of the entente powers and the acquisition by Serbia of large gains in Bosnia, Herzegovina and Dalmatia. Nor was Greece any more amenable to Russian suggestions that she might cede Kavalla to her northern neighbour. On 7 and 12 August Venizelos proposed to Demidov, the Russian ambassador in Athens, a general redrawing of Balkan frontiers.
Rumania should receive Transylvania; and Serbia, Bosnia and
Herzegovina. Albania should be partitioned between Greece, Serbia
and Italy. Bulgaria should receive Serbian Macedonia as far west as

THE WAR OF 1914-18 1914 Monastir and, if Turkey joined the central powers, part of Turkish Thrace. The settlement outlined in this proposal was as fair as could be hoped for under the circumstances. Much of it was incorporated in the Twelve Points which Russia communicated to her allies on 14 September and which can be regarded as the first allied statement of war aims, It also received the support of Sir Edward Grey. But it did not go far enough in Bulgaria’s favour to satisfy Sazonov; and by the second week in September Venizelos was threatening to resign and thus weaken the pro-entente elements in Greece if Russian pressure for the cession of Kavalla continued. Prolonged and tedious negotiations did little to alter this position in the last months of 1914. Turkey’s entry into the war seemed to increase the desirability of winning Bulgaria for the anti-German cause. It also increased the chances of doing so, for anti-Turkish traditions and prejudices still counted for a good deal in Sofia. Britain and France now began to show considerably more interest in the Balkans than they had done hitherto; but this at once aroused jealousy and distrust in Petrograd. Russia, it was felt there, had a much greater political stake in south-eastern Europe than the western powers and, as the greatest Slav state, was better able than they to arouse the sympathies of the majority of the Balkan peoples. Britain and France should therefore be willing to follow her lead in the area. These feelings perhaps explain Sazonov’s cool reception of a proposal by Grey on 17 November that Bulgaria be offered the whole of Macedonia and Serbia compensation in Bosnia—Herzegovina and on the Adriatic coast. This suggestion agreed in many ways with Sazonov’s ideas: it is at least possible that his lukewarm attitude to it was caused by an unwillingness to see the Serb-Bulgar rapprochement which he certainly desired achieved under British auspices. His attitude was unfortunate, for a really generous offer to Bulgaria at that moment might have had important effects, particularly since the entry of the Turks into the war allowed the entente to tempt her with the prospect of acquiring Turkish Thrace. By the second half of November, however, the apparently inevitable conquest of Serbia by the Austrian armies had ended any real chance that Bulgaria might side with the anti-German powers. The defeat of a great Austrian offensive by the Serbs on 7-8 December did little to shake the growing impression in Sofia that the central powers were militarily the stronger side. In their relations with Bulgaria during the first months of the war the entente powers had thus shown themselves remarkably ineffective. By the substantial offers they made her they encouraged her to exploit to the full her neutrality and her strategic position. More

serious, there had been unmistakable signs that Russia and her western partners had only a limited amount of trust in each other. The same distrust and division is visible in their attitude to the complex situation in Greece. There the Prime Minister Venizelos, a sincere liberal and the most genuine friend the western powers possessed among Balkan statesmen, faced the opposition of King Constantine, the brother-in-law of William II, who quite rightly believed that the German army was more than a match for any of its adversaries. The characters of the two men do much to explain their increasing mutual antagonism. Venizelos, though still a comparatively young man, could already look back upon a great career. He was often overbearing and sometimes unscrupulous in his methods. Constantine was far from being the treacherous autocrat whom British and French pamphleteers were soon to describe; but he was weak, hesitant and not particularly intelligent.1 Conscious of the support of much of the army and of Venizelos’s many political opponents, he grew to resent increasingly the great influence exercised by the statesmen. Venizelos had assured Pashich as early as 25 July 1914 that Greece would oppose a Bulgarian attack on Serbia: on 18 August he went further and offered his country’s support to the entente powers. The offer was a failure. Probably Constantine allowed it to be made only because he feared the Turks might take advantage of the outbreak of war to attack Greece. Nor were the allies anxious to accept it. Britain and France were as yet quite unconvinced that Balkan supporters were of any value. An agreement with Greece would antagonise Turkey; and Turkish hostility would harm the entente far more than Greek aid could strengthen it. The possibility of a Turkish attack on the Suez Canal (through which large numbers of Indian troops were even then passing en route to France) aroused much uneasiness in London. So did the belief, widely though mistakenly held in all the capitals of Europe, that the Sultan, as Caliph, might seriously influence the attitude of the vast numbers of Muslims in the British, French and Russian empires.? Prudence therefore dictated that the Greek offer should not be accepted. Moreover the greater the part Greece played in the war the better
1'The French Admiral Dartige, who had a good deal to do with him, described him as. ‘weak and inconsistent, hesitant and at the mercy of circumstances’. (A. ee Histoire diplomatique de la France pendant la grande guerre (Paris, 1938-40), i, 157). * His proclamation in November of a Jehad (Holy War) against the entente
powers had in fact very little effect. The Turkish ministers were unwilling to stress
heavily the religious aspects of the struggle because of the possible reactions this might arouse among the remaining Christian communities of the Ottoman Empire.

THE WAR OF 1914-18 1914-15 able she would be to claim territorial gains when it ended. These might include, if not Constantinople itself, the Aegean islands or some parts of western Asia Minor, control of which would establish her in a strong position in the neighbourhood of the Straits. Russia was therefore opposed to the whole idea of active participation in the struggle by Greece, an attitude which was to exert considerable influence over her policy in the Balkans as a whole for some time to come. Turkey’s entry into the war increased the value of a Greek as well as a Bulgarian alliance in the eyes of Britain and France. But no such alliance was achieved. Early in December the Greek government was offered nearly the whole of southern Albania in return for her intervention in support of Serbia, then very hard-pressed by the Austrian armies. Venizelos, however, demanded some guarantee against possible Bulgarian attack if Greece joined the entente powers, and also a discussion of the eventual fate of the Dodecanese islands. A few weeks later Grey proposed to buy Greek support with the promise of the Smyrna area and Cyprus; but Sazonov agreed to the offer being made only on condition that Greece formally abandoned all claims to Constantinople. His caution was unnecessary: when the allied proposals were presented to him on 24 January 1915 Venizelos turned them down since they still promised no protection against Bulgarian attack and gave no assurance of Rumanian support. The early months of the war therefore saw little success for entente diplomacy in the Balkans. By the end of 1914 Turkey had become an enemy, Bulgaria was wavering towards alliance with the central powers, Rumania was resolutely neutral and Greece increasingly divided.! Yet the futile negotiations of this period are not altogether unworthy of the space they have been given in the preceding pages. They illustrate a number of factors — the caution and selfishness of the Balkan states, the dominance of diplomacy by military considerations, the disunity of the anti-German powers — which were to persist throughout the struggle. By the beginning of 1915 it was clear that the war would not end so quickly as almost everyone had hitherto expected. Germany’s great offensive in the west had been checked at the battle of the Marne. In France trench warfare, slow-moving and unprecedentedly expensive in men and materials, was now the order of the day. The Russian invasion of East Prussia in the first weeks of the
1 And, it might be added for the sake of completeness, Albania had ceased to exist. Prince William had left (or rather fled from) the country in September. The Greeks occupied its southern areas in the last weeks of the year, while an Italian force seized Valona on Christmas Day.
S21


1915 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 war had been defeated much more completely and decisively, while
Austria-Hungary had been humiliatingly unsuccessful in her efforts
to crush Serbia. Everywhere the combatants were mobilising their resources and revising their plans in preparation for a prolonged struggle. The near-stalemate which now reigned on the western front led Britain and France, as well as Germany, to pay increasing attention to the Balkans and to search there for new means of breaking the deadlock in which they now found themselves. On the entente side this change of attitude culminated in an Anglo-French effort to capture the Gallipoli peninsula and force the Straits, and in the agreement of March 1915 with Russia which preceded it. A successful attack on the Straits would bring many advantages. It would open the way to the capture of Constantinople and would almost certainly lead to the surrender of Turkey and the collapse of the Young Turk regime. It would do much to make the attitude of the Balkan states more favourable to the allied cause and would greatly reduce the chances of any of them taking the side of the central powers. Above all it would make it possible for Russia to receive through her ice-free southern ports the British and French arms and equipment of which her army was already in desperate need. No longer would these have to be shipped to her White Sea coast and transported thence over the long and inadequate railway line running south from Archangel (later another was built from Murmansk). Nor was the idea completely new. Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, had envisaged the seizure of Gallipoli, possibly by a Greek army, as early as August 1914. At the end of November a plan for the capture of the Dardanelles had been drawn up by the Admiralty. On 13January 1915 the cabinet agreed that a purely naval attack should be made there (it was still not realised that to achieve permanent results it would be necessary to use troops on a considerable scale). For a time, nevertheless, it seemed that the main allied assault on Turkey might be launched from Salonika rather than at the Straits. In January Venizelos, fertile in ideas as ever, proposed an Anglo-French landing at the Greek port: this was to be combined with the entry of Rumania into the war. By the beginning of February a majority of the French cabinet had been won over to this idea and agreement had been reached with Britain on the composition of the expeditionary force. Sazonov, however, gave only half-hearted approval; and above all Bratianu still refused to give any promise of action by Rumania. This brought the whole scheme to a standstill, for in Athens Rumanian intervention
to ward off any danger of a Bulgarian attack on Greece’s northern
frontier was considered essential. By 19 February therefore the
322


THE WAR OF 1914-18 1914-15
Salonika plan had been abandoned in favour of an attack on the
Dardanelles.+ The prospect that an Anglo-French army, perhaps with Greek auxiliaries, might soon be in possession of Constantinople, aroused great anxiety in Russia. Control of the Straits had for the time being been pushed into the background by the need to defend the empire against the German and Austrian armies. Yet to many Russians it was still one of the supreme objectives of the country’s foreign policy. Most Russian statesmen saw clearly that, if achieved, it would involve them in serious future difficulties; yet in February 1914, before the outbreak of war, preparations for a Russian attack on the Bosphorus had been intensified. In September the Minister of Agriculture, Krivoshein, hinted to Paléologue, the French ambassador at St. Petersburg, that Constantinople might be internationalised? and absolute freedom of passage through the Straits for all ships established; but Sazonov had made it clear that he wished to retain at least a coaling-station in the area. Russia’s allies (Britain much more readily than France) recognised her special interest in the Straits and her prior claim to any territory which might be taken from Turkey in the area. ‘As far as Constantinople is concerned, it is clear that that city should be yours’, said George V to Benckendorff, the Russian ambassador in London, on 13 November; and Grey had already shown that he wished to co-operate with the Russian government in the settlement of the Straits question. As a quid pro quo the Russian government gave on 18 November its consent to the future annexation by Britain of Egypt, which had already been proclaimed a British protectorate on 6 August, while in a conversation with Paléologue on 21 November Nicholas II agreed that Syria should become a French sphere of influence. It seemed that at long last common sense was about to assert itself and that the partition schemes of Nicholas I were to be realised. Nevertheless distrust of her allies was still very marked in Russia; and pressure for the eventual acquisition of Constantinople was growing stronger, both in governing circles and in the Duma, as the cost and seriousness of the war became more apparent. Any danger of British or French dominance of the Straits could of course have
1 Early in 1915 there were also proposals for an attack on Alexandretta, a focal
point in Turkey’s rail communications. They were supported by Lord Kitchener,
the British Secretary of State for War, and Sir John Fisher, the First Sea Lord.
The idea of such an attack was to be resurrected more than once but was never of much practical importance.

1915 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 been averted by their seizure by Russia; and in December 1914 Sazonov was in fact pressing for an attack on the Bosphorus. But the inability of the army to spare men from the struggle with Germany and Austria-Hungary put paid to such an idea. When at the end of February 1915 it became clear that an Anglo-French attack on the Dardanelles would soon be launched, the Russian government was forced to act. In a note of 4. March Sazonov demanded that Britain and France should agree to the acquisition by Russia not merely of Constantinople, the western shore of the Straits and part of the Asiatic shore, but also of Imbros, Tenedos and southern Thrace up to the Enos—Midia line. If acceded to, those claims would give her an almost impregnable position in the area. He also showed himself deeply hostile to the acceptance by the allies of Greek help in their attack on the Straits, since he feared it might be made the basis for territorial claims inconvenient to Russia. On 1 March Venizelos had offered, on his own initiative, to send a Greek force to aid in the seizure of the Dardanelles; but Sazonov insisted, in a note of the 7th, that Greek troops must not take part in the allied entry into Constantinople and that Greece must receive no territory in the neighbourhood of the Straits. Of the entente powers only Britain showed herself really favourable to Greek participation in the campaign. The idea of Greek intervention had, however, in any case been rejected by two Crown Councils held in Athens on 3 and 5 March and also vetoed by King Constantine. As a result Venizelos resigned on the 6th. The Russian note of 4 March produced somewhat differing responses in the two western capitals. Sazonov’s demands aroused a good deal of surprise and displeasure in Paris, where there was a strong desire for the demilitarisation of the Straits and for freedom of navigation there to be guaranteed by some international body on the lines of the Danube Commission. On the 7th therefore Delcassé, the Foreign Minister, made a rather non-committal reply and suggested that the whole question be discussed by a conference of the allies in Paris. The British reaction was more favourable. On the roth a meeting between the leaders of the government and those of the Conservative opposition agreed that Russia’s claims must be conceded. But extensive counter-concessions were asked for —a dominant position for Britain in the ‘neutral zone’ of Persia; freedom of navigation for merchant ships in the Straits; the transformation of Constantinople into a free port and Russian agreement to future discussion of British and French interests in Asia Minor. Moreover satisfaction of Russia’s demands was made conditional on the
324


THE WAR OF 1914-18 1915 ultimate victory of the entente powers; and the whole agreement was
to be kept secret because of the effect its revelation might have on
the Balkan states. These terms, embodied in a memorandum of 12 March, were submitted to Russia in a note of the 20th. Sazonov accepted the British proposals but asked in return for freedom of action in the Russian zone of Persia, which amounted to its de facto annexation. Simultaneously the French government was attempting to secure, in return for its agreement to Russia’s demands, recognition in St. Petersburg of a French sphere of influence in Syria and Cilicia. This Paléologue obtained in negotiations of the 15-17 March, though only with some difficulty (many Russians had hoped that Cilicia might become part of an independent Armenian state under Russian influence). But it was not until 10 April that France formally agreed to a Russian annexation of Constantinople and the Straits, and then only on condition that ‘France and Britain accomplish their plans in the East as well as elsewhere’. From the Russian note of 4 March there had thus grown in a few weeks an imposing series of schemes for political and territorial changes over a vast area. It has often been argued that the agreements eventually arrived at were more favourable to Russia than her real power at that time justified. This is true. Britain and France were able to transport very large forces to Gallipoli, maintain them there for months, and come close to decisive victory. By contrast the desire of the Russian Foreign Ministry to launch an attack on the Bosphorus was completely unrealistic. Russia never possessed during the war naval superiority to Turkey in the Black Sea, while proposals in March 1915 that she might seize the Bulgarian port of Burgas as a base for action against the Straits were vetoed by Britain and France. Above all the catastrophic defeats which she was now suffering in Poland confirmed the unwillingness of her high command to detach troops from the main theatre of operations for a risky expedition of this kind. But it was precisely her weakness which drove the western powers to treat her with such generosity. The fear that conservative elements hostile to the alliance with Britain and France might gain the upper hand in Petrograd, make a separate peace with Germany and then concentrate Russia’s energies on expansion in Asia, was a very real one in London and Paris. The possibility of a return in this way to the principles which had governed Russian policy in the later 1880s and 1890s was probably exaggerated. Its main advocate, Count Witte, the former Minister of Finance, died in March 1915; and conservative and potentially pro-German circles in Russia were soon to be deeply antagonised by German efforts to create a pseudo-independent Polish state.
BEN,


1915 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
Nevertheless the possibility existed ;1 and Sazonov, irritating though
he was in many ways, was one of the main barriers against its
realisation. His continuance in office was therefore an objective for
which the British and French governments were willing to make
considerable sacrifices. For it they promised Russia immensely
important territorial gains and cold-shouldered Greece.? By
threatening to resign and thus open the way to a change of policy in Russia unless his demands were met Sazonov was able to blackmail Britain and France into acquiescence to Russia’s wishes. But their governments enjoyed the process no more than the Russian one did the sight of an apparently imminent Anglo-French occupation of the Straits. The negotiations of March 1915 showed once more how little real trust or community of outlook existed between Russia and
her western partners. The assault on the Dardanelles had begun before the secret agreements of March—April were made, with a naval bombardment of the forts there on 19 February. It was still hoped that these could be destroyed and the way to Constantinople opened by purely naval action: a land campaign was not as yet envisaged. It soon became clear that this view was far too optimistic. In Constantinople it was generally felt that the naval attack must succeed, for the prestige of the British fleet was immense. The Turkish government had made preparations to evacuate the city and move to Eskishehr in Asia Minor; and the defences of the Dardanelles were very weak. On the 18th of March, however, a full-scale attack by the British and French fleets failed with the loss of four battleships (to mines, not to the Turkish guns). Four days later the idea of a purely naval operation was abandoned. Whether the attack of the 18th would have succeeded if pressed more vigorously and with greater disregard of losses has often been debated. It is now known that the Turkish artillery was very short of ammunition by the end of the day; and the allied commander, Vice-Admiral Sir John de Robeck, may have been excessively cautious. But the attack failed; and its failure greatly strengthened the position of the Young Turks and condemned the British and French armies to a difficult and expensive land campaign. The details of this campaign are scarcely relevant here. The first

THE WAR OF 1914-18 1915 allied landings took place on 25 April; but the courage of the Turkish troops and the difficulties of the ground prevented their gaining more than one or two bridgeheads on the Gallipoli peninsula. New landings in August had no more success, thanks largely to poor leadership, and it was becoming clear that the campaign was a failure. The decision to leave the peninsula was taken early in December: the evacuation was carried out, with great skill and extraordinary slight losses, at the end of the month and in the first days of 1916. The Dardanelles campaign was a disaster for the entente powers not merely in itself but in its political repercussions in the Balkans. The Turks could do little to exploit their victory, partly because their losses had been at least as heavy as those of the allies and partly because Enver continued to dissipate much of his country’s energies on futile projects of conquest in the Caucasus and central Asia.! But the defeat, combined with the disasters which were now overtaking the Russian army in Poland, made it clear that any Balkan state which sided openly with the allies was risking its existence. Under these circumstances entente diplomacy in the Balkans was doomed to failure; and this failure was made clear when Bulgaria joined the central powers in October. The allies had done all they could to prevent this: Bulgaria was the main target of their diplomacy throughout the summer of 1915. But they still faced the insoluble dilemma which had confronted them in the previous year. The Bulgarians demanded Macedonia at the expense of Serbia and Kavalla at the expense of Greece. The allies could and did urge Serbia and Greece to make these sacrifices; but they could offer them in return merely promises — of the cession of Bosnia, Herzegovina and part of the Dalmatian coast to Serbia, of part of western Asia Minor to Greece. Naturally neither country was anxious to make so one-sided a bargain. Moreover the situation was now being complicated by the entry of Italy into the struggle on the allied side. From the outbreak of the war she had bargained skilfully with both groups of combatants, attempting to secure the highest possible price for her support or even her neutrality, but it was always clear that her desire to acquire the Italian-populated areas of the Trentino and Trieste was likely to throw her into the arms of the entente. Her ambitions, however, went much farther than this. They included the dream of an Adriatic made virtually

Liman von Sanders, now commander of the Turkish 5th Army, strongly but ineffectively opposed all involvement in Persia as a waste of resources.
327


1915 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 an Italian lake by the annexation of Dalmatia, and of an empire in
Asia Minor. By the secret treaty of London of 26 April she was promised as the price of her help the Trentino, Istria and a large part of Dalmatia, Southern Dalmatia was to go to Serbia but was to be ‘neutralised’, while Italy was promised an ‘equitable share’ in
the partition of Asia Minor and compensation should Britain and France acquire German colonies. Obviously Italian ambitions in the Adriatic conflicted sharply with those of Serbia; and in the negotiations which preceded the signature of the treaty Sazonov had attempted without much success to secure for the Serbs a larger share of the Dalmatian coast. But the restriction of Serbia’s outlet to the Adriatic was hardly likely to increase her willingness to make sacrifices in Macedonia.1 Moreover Italy’s vague claims in Asia Minor were almost certain to conflict to some extent with the ambitions of Greece. Thus when at the end of May 1915 the allies made a big offer to Bulgaria in return for an attack by her on Turkey (a large part of Macedonia, Turkish Thrace to the Enos—Midia line, perhaps Kavalla and the Dobrudja) the reaction in Serbia and Greece was violently hostile. The Bulgarian government (which had been offered somewhat similar gains by Austria-Hungary on 5 June in return merely for neutrality) gave a non-committal answer a fortnight later asking for more details of the proposed cessions. To this the entente powers found it very hard to reply. Their disagreement on policy in the Balkans was continually increasing; and by July feelings had become so inflamed by Serbia’s obstinacy that Russia proposed that the allies occupy Dubrovnik and Split and threaten to cut her off from the Adriatic unless she gave way over Macedonia. A new series of proposals to Bulgaria, put forward early in August largely on the initiative of Great Britain, serving merely to irritate the Greeks still further. Moreover by promising ‘huge’ compensations to Serbia in Bosnia and Herzegovina and on the Adriatic in return for the cession of Macedonia they aroused much opposition in Italy. These laborious efforts to gain Bulgaria’s favour were quite futile, Pashich indeed agreed, on 1 September, to cede most of Macedonia to the Bulgarians; but the cession was to take place only at the end of the war. Moreover he demanded in return gains not only in Bosnia, Herzegovina and Dalmatia, but also in
? On the other hand the treaty of London meant that Austria-Hungary, which now wished to concentrate her forces against Italy, became willing to make peace with Serbia on relatively generous terms. In return for the cession to her of northeastern Serbia she was willing to allow the Serbs to annex northern Albania and absorb Montenegro.
328


THE WAR OF 1914-18 1915 Croatia, Slovenia and the southern Banat. The expansion of Serbia
in these areas would create so much hostility in Italy and Rumania that his proposal raised more difficulties than it solved. Underlying all these repetitive negotiations and territorial squabbles was the Russian defeat and retreat in Poland. ‘Beyond all other adverse circumstances,’ wrote Grey a decade later, ‘the situation was dominated by the appalling disasters to the Russian army that continued all through the summer. It was these that made all the diplomacy of the Allies in dealing with Bulgaria just futile waste of time and effort’. In particular the capture of Warsaw by the Germans at the beginning of August acted as a powerful stimulus to the Bulgarian government to join what seemed to be the winning side and seize some of the territory it coveted while it had the chance. King Ferdinand, after long hesitations, had probably decided as early as June to join the central powers, though Russophil groups were still offering a good deal of resistance to such a step. An alliance was signed on 6 September. A secret convention signed simultaneously provided for the cession to Bulgaria, in return for her intervention against the Serbs, of Serbian Macedonia and part of north and east Serbia (this would give her a common frontier with Austria—Hungary). If Rumania and Greece entered the war on the entente side she was also to recover the territory she had lost to them in 1913. Germany had already persuaded the Turks to cede part of Thrace to King Ferdinand by an agreement of 3 September. (The ease with which she was able to do this contrasts very strikingly with her opponents’s difficulties with Serbia over Macedonia. It shows clearly how much more effectively than they she was able to control her Balkan allies.) As it became obvious in the weeks which followed the signing of the alliance that Bulgaria was passing into the enemy camp various projects for restraining or neutralising her were discussed in the entente capitals. None came to anything. Suggestions for a GreekRumanian alliance to hold her in check broke down on the refusal of Bratianu to take any action unless the allies sent an army of 400,000 men to the Balkans.? If they could have done this neither Greek nor Rumanian support would have been needed. A lastminute Serbian suggestion that a preventive attack be launched on Bulgaria as she mobilised was turned down by Sazonov, who still found it hard to believe in Bulgarian hostility. Finally on 4 October

1915 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 the allies demanded that German officers in Bulgaria, of whom there were now a considerable number, should be sent home within twenty-four hours. The Bulgarian government’s failure to comply led to the breaking-off of diplomatic relations the following day. Bulgaria’s entry into the war doomed Serbia. A German and Austrian offensive early in October combined with Bulgarian attacks in Macedonia quickly ended the remarkable resistance to greatly superior opponents which she had offered for so long. Belgrade fell in the first days of the German offensive, Nish early in November. The king and the remnants of the army, after an epic march through Montenegro and northern Albania, reached the port of Valona. By April 1916 they had found refuge in the island of Corfu. As well as helping to destroy Serbia, Bulgaria’s intervention led to a serious political and even moral crisis in Greece. Her attack on the Serbs was clearly a casus foederis under the Greco—Serbian treaty of 1 June 1913.1 Equally clearly Serbia could not now provide the 150,000 men which that treaty bound each partner to contribute to the joint war effort. But if the entente powers were willing to make up the deficiency from their own forces honour demanded that Greece help Serbia as the treaty required. On 22 September 1915 Venizelos, who had now returned to power, offered, if the allies would provide an army of the specified size, to enter the war on their side. Neither Joffre, the French Commander-in-Chief, nor Kitchener, was enthusiastic about the idea of tying down more men in the Balkans; but the offer was accepted. On 3 October an Anglo-French force began to disembark at Salonika. But with Turkey victorious at the Dardanelles, powerful Bulgarian and German forces poised to overrun Serbia, and the Russian army fatally weakened in Poland, prudence seemed to many Greeks to demand that their country remain neutral. Around this dilemma arose the most serious of all the disagreements between Venizelos and King Constantine. The king was adamant that Greece must not enter the war; and his attitude almost certainly saved the country from a disastrous struggle with Bulgaria. Venizelos was forced to resign on 5 October. His successor, Zaimis, at once made it clear that he would do nothing for the Serbs. Thus a British proposal for a Greco-Rumanian alliance to save Serbia was quite fruitless, even though the assistance of an AngloFrench army of 200,000 men was promised to make it more palatable. In the same way a desperate offer, on 17 October, to cede Cyprus in return for immediate Greek help to Serbia was refused three days later. By the second half of the month it was clear that the Greek army would not move. 1 See p. 298.
ey


THE WAR OF 1914-18 1915
But without Greek aid there was little hope of doing anything effective to help the Serbs. The Anglo-French force at Salonika by itself was too small (as yet only about 20,000 men) to make much difference to the military situation.1 Within a few days of the landing the justification for maintaining it had vanished. The British government drew the logical conclusion and pressed for its withdrawal and use elsewhere. But that of France was strongly in favour of holding the great Aegean port. A withdrawal, the French ministers argued, coming at the end of a long series of defeats for the entente powers, would have devastating effects on what remained of their prestige in the Balkans and the Levant. They had their way. In the months which followed the Anglo-French forces at Salonika were slowly increased in number. They were joined in 1916 by what remained of the Serbian army, reconstituted after the terrible retreat to the Adriatic. Later they were reinforced by a small Italian contingent as well as by Greek troops. But beyond pinning down a considerable part of the Bulgarian army this imposing conglomeration did little to assist the allied cause. The uncertainty of the political situation in Greece and perhaps the lack of enterprise of its commander, General Sarrail, meant that it did not take the offensive successfully and on a large scale until the war was almost over. From the standpoint of the central powers nothing could have been more convenient. ‘If we had compelled the Entente forces to withdraw from Macedonia,’ wrote Hindenburg after the war, ‘we should have had them on our necks again on the Western Front. I always regarded it as at least doubtful whether we should have been allowed to employ the Bulgarian troops thus released outside the Balkans.’? The history of the allied occupation of Salonika is one of the best examples of the military idiocies which can be committed in a search for political advantages. Thus neither the generals nor the diplomats of the entente had much reason to boast of their achievements in the Balkans in 1915. Serbia had been overwhelmed; Bulgaria had joined the enemy camp; Turkey had shown unexpected vitality, Greece increasing division and vacillation. Britain, France and Russia were now bound together by a series of complex schemes for the partition of the Ottoman Empire; but the profound differences of outlook which divided them had become more acute. It seemed that the losses and defeats of the previous two years

1916 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
might be compensated for when Rumania entered the war on the entente side at the end of August 1916. Her action, like those of all the Balkan states during this period, was decided not by diplomacy but by the fortunes of the conflicting armies. In the spring and early summer of 1916 the French were offering stubborn resistance, though at great cost, to Falkenhayn’s onslaught on Verdun. The British launched their great offensive on the Somme on 1 July. Above all the Russian offensive in the Bukovina in June won brilliant successes and took half a million prisoners. Its continuance might well mean the collapse of Austria-Hungary. Bratianu decided that the time had come to abandon the neutrality to which he had adhered so stubbornly for two years and to seize Transylvania. Even now, however, he showed the caution and taste for hard bargaining which the powers had learned to know so well. The Rumanian government agreed on 4 July to enter the war; but only on exacting conditions. Rumania must receive large supplies of war material from the allies. They must guarantee her against Bulgarian attack. They must continue their offensives on both the eastern and western fronts and thus divert the resources of the central powers away from the Balkans. A military convention with Britain and France was signed at Chantilly on 23 July; but Bratianu refused to ratify it and his demands continued to delay an agreement with Russia. He wished if possible to make war only on Austria-Hungary and was particularly anxious to avoid any declaration against Bulgaria. Also he was now demanding that Rumania be admitted to the entente as a full member (as Italy had been) and that the allies promise unconditionally not to make peace till her territorial claims had been satisfied. This was a high, indeed an arrogant, tone to be taken by the Prime Minister of a small and not particularly wellgoverned state. Yet Russia, under French pressure, conceded (or at least professed to concede) what he demanded.” An agreement between Rumania and the allies was signed in Bucharest on 17 August. It guaranteed the country’s existing frontiers and promised her Transylvania, the Bukovina and the Banat of Temesvar. A military convention was signed simultaneously.

THE WAR OF 1914-18 1916-17 Council continued to support a policy of neutrality; but war was declared on Austria-Hungary on the evening of 27 August. Germany, Bulgaria and Turkey all declared war on Rumania within the next few days. In the weeks which followed the Rumanians occupied much of Transylvania without opposition; but it soon became clear that Bratianu had overreached himself. In June, with the Russian offensive in full flood, the mediocre Rumanian army might have threatened the existence of the Habsburg Empire. In September, with the Russians checked and their forces increasingly demoralised by losses and shortage of equipment, it could do little lasting damage. A combined German, Bulgarian and Turkish force under FieldMarshal von Mackensen crossed the Danube; and Austrian troops stiffened by German units began to recover Transylvania. An attack by the Anglo-French force at Salonika gained a little ground but had not much more than token significance. On 6 December Bucharest fell. By January 1917 two-thirds of Rumania was in enemy occupation. The king and the government fled to Jassy and a pro-German administration was installed in Bucharest. The remnants of the army retreated to Moldavia, where they maintained a successful defensive until the collapse of Russia made it impossible for them to hold out longer. The conquered territory was a valuable prize, economically more valuable than any conquest hitherto made by the central powers with the possible exception of Belgium. It could supply them with great quantities of oil and wheat, which they now desperately needed. It is significant that the export of wheat to Germany from the conquered provinces began even before the fall of Bucharest and that plans for their economic exploitation were ready before those for the military administration to be set up there. By the end of 1916 the Balkans had lost much of the importance they had possessed in international relations during the first two years of the war. One by one the states of the area had been drawn into the conflict until only Greece, deeply divided and militarily a third-rate power, still clung to her neutrality. The collapse of Serbia and Rumania meant that entente diplomacy had now little scope. Grandiose schemes of alliances between the Balkan states, of concerted attacks by them on Austria—Hungary or Turkey, were a thing of the past. The attention of all the combatants was now focussed on more real and more important issues — the approaching revolution in Russia, the attitude of the United States, the growing strain and discontent within their own borders. The second half of
the war saw the Balkans become, politically and militarily, almost a backwater.
350


1915-16 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
Neither side, however, could afford to ignore completely the increasingly explosive situation in Greece. The resignation of Venizelos early in October 1915 led to a growth of friction between the entente powers and the monarchist cabinets which succeeded him. The attitude of the former became more and more uncompromising as they saw, or thought they saw, their opponents gain the upper hand in Athens. At the end of November they forced the Greek government to withdraw its troops from Salonika. The months which followed saw continual petty disputes —over General Sarrail’s expulsion of the German and Austrian consuls from Salonika and over allied mine-laying, without the consent of the Greek government, in Greek territorial waters. More serious, the pro-German Skouloudis cabinet refused to permit the Serbian army, after its reorganisation in Corfu, to cross Greek territory en route to Salonika. Above all it allowed the important Fort Rupel, at the head of the Struma valley, to be surrendered to the Bulgarians without any attempt at resistance in May 1916. This hampered, as it was intended to do, the movements of the allied force at Salonika, and seemed in London and Paris to show that Greece was now a de facto ally of the central powers. The Anglo-French reply was rapid and violent. A force under the French General Moreau was despatched to Salamis and on 21 June presented to the Greek government an ultimatum which it was powerless to resist. The Greek army was to be reduced to a peacetime footing, the Skouloudis cabinet expelled from office and new elections held. The Athens chief of police must be dismissed and German agents and propagandists driven from the country. The result was the appointment as Prime Minister of Zaimis, the non-Venizelist politician least hostile to the entente powers, and a temporary recovery of their influence at Athens. But Greece was no longer an independent country. She was now merely an arena which the central powers and their opponents struggled to dominate, competing to bend the government to their will by threats and pressure. In the summer of 1916 a German-—Bulgarian force overran eastern Macedonia, encountering little resistance in the process. In September Kavalla itself was taken and its garrison interned in Germany. On 4 October the cabinet decided on an immediate declaration of war on Bulgaria; but the king refused to agree to this and the government fell. The helplessness and division of the country had now reached their lowest point. Early in September an Anglo
French naval force was sent to Salamis with a demand that the
Greek postal and telegraph system be placed under allied control
and that German agents be expelled. Simultaneously a Venizelist
334


THE WAR OF 1914-18 1916-17
League of National Defence was set up in Salonika to oppose the policies of the king. On the 25th Venizelos left Athens for Crete. There, in his native island, he proclaimed armed resistance to the government. His attitude won immediate support in the other islands; and on g October he went to Salonika, where he set up a provisional government. Almost simultaneously the commander of the allied squadron at Salamis demanded the surrender of part of the Greek fleet and the subjection of the country’s ports and railways to allied control. These conditions were accepted, after a formal protest, by the helpless Greek government. On 23-24 October, in a series of conversations with a visiting French deputy, King Constantine offered to withdraw his troops to the Peloponnese and disarm them if he were assured that the army Venizelos was collecting at Salonika would be used only against the Bulgars. No state in modern history has suffered such a series of humiliations as Greece in the second half of 1916 and some reaction to them was inevitable. It came at the beginning of December. On the rst a small force of British and French troops landed from the squadron at Salamis to take possession of a quantity of war material which the Greek government had agreed to surrender to the allies as a guarantee of its good faith. They were fired on by Greek troops and forced to re-embark. The allies responded by the recognition of the Venizelist government at Salonika and the proclamation of a blockade of Greece. On the 14th they insisted that the Greek army be withdrawn to the Peloponnese under allied control. By delay and chicanery, the natural weapons of the weak, the Greek government was able to avoid complete compliance with these demands. Public opinion in the neutral states, above all in America, made it difficult for the entente powers to go to extremes against Constantine and his supporters — after all Great Britain at least had entered the war in defence of Belgian neutrality. Above all they were divided among themselves on the Greek question as on so many others. Britain was in general more favourable to Venizelos than her partners. Russia and Italy, who feared the emergence of a Greek government sympathetic to the entente as a competitor for the spoils of Turkey, were hostile to him. France occupied an intermediate position. The arrival of a new allied Commissioner in Athens, the Frenchman Jonnart, at the beginning of June 1917, was inspired in part by an ineffective desire to achieve greater unity between the allies. (The fall of the monarchy in Russia and the fact that Italy had just been promised an extensive sphere of influence in Asia Minor" had made these powers somewhat more willing to adopt severe measures in

Greece.) Jonnart had instructions to secure the abdication of the
king, if possible by peaceful means. In this he was successful. On 11 June he presented Constantine with an ultimatum demanding his abdication within 24 hours under threat of the bombardment of Athens. The king withdrew to his country-house and left a few days later for Switzerland. His second son, Alexander, succeeded him. Formally the allied victory was complete. The blockade of the Greek coast was lifted on the 17th and Venizelos formed a ministry on the 27th, On 2 July Greece entered the war on the allied side. Her position in 1914-17 was exceptionally difficult. Yet it is hard not to see her history during these years in terms of wasted opportunities. Her geography made her far more vulnerable to allied pressure than any other part of the Balkan peninsula and the forces driving her towards the allied side were always powerful. Had she entered the struggle at the beginning of the Dardanelles campaign or intervened in defence of Serbia she would have played an honourable role without risking her existence — British and French seapower could always defend the Greek islands and probably the Peloponnese. She would also have received a promise of extensive territorial gains and perhaps a down payment in the form of Cyprus. As it was, she was driven into the war, deeply divided, at a moment when her intervention was completely overshadowed by that of the United States.
Long before the Venizelist triumph the whole situation in the middle east had been transformed by two new factors — the Arab revolt and the collapse of Russia. Conscious nationalism was still confined in 1914 to a few parts of the Arab world (above all Syria) and to a few social groups (above all army officers and intellectuals). But discontent with Turkish rule was widespread. It was accentuated by the stresses of the war; and particularly by the attempts of Djemal Pasha, as governor of Syria, to crush the embryonic nationalist organisations there from the spring of 1915 onwards. As early as February 1914 the Sharif Husain of Mecca, who was to play a central role in the Arab national movement in the years which followed, had approached Kitchener, then British Agent and Consul-General in Egypt, for possible British support against the Turks. Husain was an elderly man and had hardly any contact with western ideas. He wished mainly to safeguard his own authority, which he felt to be challenged by the appointment of a new Turkish governor in the Hedjaz, and to
? Constantine did not, however, formally abdicate, a fact which was later to be of importance.

THE WAR OF 1914-18 1914-16 ensure that the Emirate of Mecca continued to be held by his own family. He had no desire to destroy the Ottoman Empire: indeed a few weeks before the Turkish entry into the war he had urged the Sultan and Enver to remain neutral since involvement in the struggle was likely to be disastrous to it.1 Moreover his effective authority was very limited. He was on bad terms with Ibn Saud, the ruler of all central Arabia, and with the Imam of Yemen (with both of whom Great Britain was negotiating). The relatively advanced and educated Arabs of Syria regarded his subjects as mere barbarians. Yet the possibility of using him as a weapon against the Turks could not be neglected. In September, Kitchener, now Secretary of State for War, began sounding him as to his attitude if Turkey should join the central powers. At the end of October he offered to guarantee Husain’s position and defend him against outside attack should he side with Britain. During the next few months the Sharif cautiously attempted to guage the attitude of his neighbours to a war against the Turks and also refused, on the ground that he feared British reprisals, to support the Zehad proclaimed by the Sultan in November. A number of Arab officers in the Turkish army in Syria and Irak asked him in January 1915 to lead a revolt against the Turks; and soon afterwards he sent his son Feisal to Damascus to get in touch with the nationalist groups there. He continued, however, to behave with great caution; and intermittent negotiations between him and the British High Commissioner in Egypt, Sir Henry MacMahon, dragged on from July 1915 to February 1916. In August 1915 Husain offered to enter the war if the independence under his rule of Arabia, Syria (including Palestine) and Irak were recognised by Britain. She must also be prepared to recognise an Arab Caliph if one were proclaimed (the Sharif had of course himself in mind here). MacMahon’s reply was non-committal; but on 24 October he agreed to British recognition of Arab independence in Syria, except for some western areas where the population was in any case not purely Arab.? This promise was made without prejudice to the interests of France. Moreover the Arabs, after achieving independence, were to recognise the special position of Britain in the Basra and Baghdad vilayets and to employ only British advisers. The note in which this offer was made was later to achieve quite unforeseen importance and to become the

Zeine, The Struggle for Arab Independence: Western Diplomacy and the Rise and Fall of Feisal’s Kingdom in Syria (Beyrut, 1960), p. 212. 2The southern frontiers of Syria, however, were left undefined. This later allowed the British government to argue, not altogether convincingly, that Palestine was not included in the area covered by MacMahon’s promise.
337


1915-16 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
basis of extremely inconvenient and contentious Arab claims. The
best-known historian of these events has declared that it “may
perhaps be regarded as the most important international document
in the history of the Arab national movement’.! Husain however
continued to maintain his claim to Aleppo and Beyrut, which the British note had refused to recognise. He also asked for guarantees against Britain making a separate peace with the Turks and for a promise of her support when peace was finally negotiated. The French government agreed on 21 December to accept an Arab administration of Damascus, Homs and Aleppo (i.e. of most of Syria) but only if it were under French influence. Early in 1916 the negotiations between Husain and MacMahon ended with an agreement to postpone the question of Syria until peace was made. Meanwhile in December 1915 Britain had recognised the position and independence of Ibn Saud, an agreement which conflicted acutely with the Sharif’s ambitions.” Husain had intended to begin the revolt only in August 1916; but his hand was forced by the despatch of a strong Turkish force accompanied by some German experts from Syria down the Hedjaz railway to Medina. Fearing, probably with reason, that this was the prelude to action against him, he began the Arab revolt by a rising in Mecca on 10 June. On 5 October he proclaimed himself king of Arabia and in December the British government recognised him as independent ruler of the Hedjaz. At first the progress of the movement was slow. Indeed 1916 saw the Ottoman Empire win considerable successes on its eastern and southern frontiers. In Mesopotamia an attempt by a British force based on Basra to capture Baghdad had been checked in November 1915: part of the force in question was compelled to surrender at Kut-el-Amarna in April of the following year. A Turkish attack on Egypt in April 1916 was easily repulsed; but transport difficulties (their great bugbear in all the campaigns against Turkey) prevented the British from doing more than take possession of the Sinai desert. A serious famine in Syria and the Lebanon did far more than either British or Arabs to shake the Turkish position. Moreover the military capacities of Husain’s followers, at least for
*G. Antonius, The Arab Awakening (London, 1938), p. 169. * Negotiations with Ibn Saud were handled by the India Office, those with
Husain by the Foreign Office and the High Commissioner for Egypt. This, added
to the slowness and difficulty of communication with Arabia, tended to make
British policy in the area somewhat incoherent. It should be remembered that Ibn
Saud’s friendship was almost as important, from the standpoint of Britain’s interest
in Mesopotamia, as good relations with the Sharif from that of her interest in
Syria and Palestine.
338


THE WAR OF 1914-18 L915-17
systematic and continuous operations, were slight. An experienced Sudanese officer described them in October 1916, perhaps with some exaggeration, as ‘a cowardly and undisciplined rabble’.! The revolt was to have great political and psychological importance, in the outside world as well as in the Arab countries; but many historians, attracted ‘by its more romantic aspects, have tended to overrate its military significance. Even a writer predisposed in favour of the movement and its achievements estimates its rifle-strength early in 1917 at only 28,000. Some Arab successes were achieved (with the help of British equipment and technicians) in the capture of Wejh and Akaba. The Hedjaz railway was repeatedly cut and trains on it destroyed — activities in which Colonel T. E. Lawrence, one of a number of British officers attached to the Arab forces, played a great part. But it was long before the Turkish position in Palestine was seriously shaken. A British attack launched from Egypt was defeated at Gaza in April 1917; though this was offset by an important success in Mesopotamia, where Baghdad fell to a British force in March. Not until November of that year did the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, reinforced and commanded by General Allenby, break through the Turkish lines between Beersheba and Gaza. When it did, progress became somewhat more rapid. Jerusalem fell in December; but this was followed by Turkish counter-attacks and a long pause for the reorganisation of the British forces. Not until October 1918, in the last days of the war, was Damascus taken.? Long before then the political future of Syria and Mesopotamia had been decided, at least in essentials, by the allies. France had well-established traditional interests in Syria; and the sweeping claims in the Straits area put forward by Russia in March 1915, which clearly opened the way for a partition of the Ottoman Empire, suggested to some French statesmen that these should now be safeguarded by an agreement with Britain. On 23 March Delcassé proposed that the two countries should hold discussions to clarify their ambitions in Asia Minor and the Levant; but Grey thought the suggestion premature. He wished to retain in the Middle East a large independent Muslim state centred on the Holy Places of Mecca and Medina, an ambition which aroused little sympathy in France. However on 21 October 1915, as the likelihood of an Arab revolt against Turkish rule became clearer and the desire of the India Office

This well-meant gesture helped to give contemporaries, and has helped to give some historians, an exaggerated idea of the military impor
tance of the Arab revolt. On this episode see E. Kedourie, ‘The Capture of Damascus, 1 October, 1918,’ Middle Eastern Studies i(1964-5), pp. 66-83.

for a British protectorate over Mesopotamia grew stronger, he
suggested that the French government send a representative to
London to discuss the redrawing of frontiers in Asia Minor and the
Arab countries which would follow an allied victory. In November
therefore the former French consul-general in Beyrut, Georges Picot,
arrived in London; during the weeks which followed he held a series of discussions with Sir Mark Sykes, the Assistant Secretary to the War Cabinet who acted as the representative of Great Britain. On the whole the result of these was favourable to the British point of view. The proposal to include Beyrut in an Arab state to be set up in Syria, which Sykes put forward early in the conversations, had to be abandoned. But by an agreement signed on 3 January 1916 he secured French consent to the control by Britain of Mesopotamia as far north as Baghdad and to her possession of the ports of Haifa and Acre. She was also to have a sphere of influence linking these ports to Mesopotamia. A crescent of British-controlled or Britishdominated territory would thus stretch from Basra to the coast of Palestine. Picot also agreed to the placing of Palestine under some form of international regime. These were substantial concessions by France. She had abandoned the contention that Palestine should be regarded as a part of Syria and as such come under her exclusive influence. She had also promised Britain a dominant position in a large though not very valuable belt of territory covering parts of eastern Syria, which could be regarded as another modification of her traditional claims. But in spite of these concessions the area allocated to her by the agreement was very large. She was to control, directly or indirectly, the coastal areas of Syria and the whole of Cilicia. She was also to have a sphere of influence including the Syrian hinterland and running eastwards to the Persian frontier. The agreement of 3 January was a purely Anglo-French affair; and the next four months saw protracted negotiations for its acceptance by Russia. The stumbling-block here was that the Russian government objected to the inclusion of part of Armenia in the French sphere of influence (the idea of an independent Armenia under Russian tutelage was still very much alive in Petrograd) and still more to the extension of that sphere to the Persian frontier. This was quite correctly seen as a barrier to Russian expansion southwards from the Caucasus. An expert committee to review the whole
question of the frontiers which Russia should demand in Anatolia
was set up on 14 March; and the demands of the naval representative on it for the acquisition of the port of Sinope, on the north coast of
Asia Minor, soon became another point of Franco—Russian disagree
ment. Nevertheless a rather uneasy compromise was reached, in
340


THE WAR OF 1914-18 1916
spite of French efforts to treat the agreement of 3 January with Britain as unalterable. On 11 March Sykes (who with Picot had gone to Russia to take part in the discussions) proposed that France withdraw her claim to the Kirkuk vilayet and receive in return some additional territory in the Sivas-Kharput—Caesarea area. This suggestion was embodied in a Franco—Russian agreement of 26 April and in Anglo-French and Anglo—Russian ones of 16 and 23 May 1916. These promised Russia the vilayets of Van, Bitlis, Trebizond and Erzerum — in other words Armenia and much of Kurdistan. Most of this territory had in fact been conquered by the Russian army before the end of the summer. The agreements also gave Britain and France, in addition to the areas to be directly administered by them in Mesopotamia and western Syria, extensive spheres of influence. That of France was to cover the rest of Syria and the Mosul vilayet and to extend as far as the Persian frontier. That of Britain was to cover an even larger though less valuable area between internationally-controlled Palestine and Mesopotamia. In these spheres an Arab state or confederation of states was to be established. The question of Russia’s claim to Sinope was left in suspense. Her frontier, it was agreed, should be pushed forward to ‘a point on the shore of the Black Sea west of Trebizond’. Discussions on a possible grant by Russia of freedom of trade to Britain in the Black Sea dragged on till September with little result. The interallied negotiations of November 1915—May 1916 thus illustrate, like those of March—April 1915, the divisions of the states concerned at least as much as their willingness to co-operate. The implicit antagonism between Britain and France in the Levant was now becoming more obvious to many people in both countries.! In Paris it was to arouse growing apprehension as it became clear that when the war ended British forces would probably be in control of a large part of the territory and the sphere of influence allotted to France. Moreover the mutual distrust which divided Russia and the western powers was now greater than ever; and the growing disintegration of the Tsarist regime merely made Russian statesmen more obstinate in insisting on the letter of their rights under the secret agreements. The fact that the three powers had to treat each other as equals did much to prolong and intensify the conflicts between them. Germany could always in the last analysis impose her views on her allies, who were now little more than her satellites, and thus give the policies of the central powers a

certain unity and consistency. But neither Britain nor France could treat the other, or even disintegrating Russia, as Germany treated Austria-Hungary, Turkey or Bulgaria. The second half of 1916 saw the introduction of another new and important factor into the situation. For the first time Italian claims in Asia Minor began to give serious trouble to the allies. Italy had been promised by the treaty of London a sphere of influence in the Adalia district of Asia Minor (to which she had no historical, economic or ethnic claim) in case the Ottoman Empire were partitioned; but she played no part in the negotiations which have just been described. At the end of August 1916, however, she declared war on Germany (her declaration of May 1915 had been directed only against Austria-Hungary) and her Prime Minister, Sonnino, used this as a pretext to demand that any agreements the allies had reached regarding the future of Asia Minor should be made known to him. The French government, which foresaw Italian opposition to its claims, made difficulties; but early in October the agreements were communicated by Sir Edward Grey to the Italian ambassador in London. The French fears were fully justified. Early in November Sonnino put forward very large demands based on Article [X of the treaty of London. The vilayets of Konia, Adana and Aidin, including the great port of Smyrna should, he claimed, become an Italian sphere of influence. Gains of this magnitude would clearly be made partly at the expense of France. They would also, though this was not of such immediate importance, bar the way to the realisation of Greek dreams of annexing a large part of western Asia Minor. The months which followed thus saw a new round of territorial haggling, this time mainly between France and Italy. On 2 December the Italian government accepted the Straits agreement of March-April 1915, though only on condition that ‘Italy realises her strivings in the East and in other places’. But a conference on its claims in Asia Minor which opened in London on 29 January 1917 ended in failure early in March, mainly because of the refusal of Russia to agree to Italian control of Smyrna. However the unmistakable disintegration of the Tsarist regime was now greatly reducing Russia’s influence over her allies. This process was accelerated by the revolution of March and the collapse of the monarchy. On 11 April the British and French Prime Ministers, Lloyd George and Ribot, met at Folkestone and agreed to concede Smyrna to Italy. A few days later, in a meeting with Sonnino at St. Jean de Maurienne on April 19-21, they promised him not merely Smyrna and the vilayet of Aidin but a large sphere of influence stretching northwards almost to the Sea of Marmora.
343


1917 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 In essence this was an attempt to divert Italian expansionism away
from Cilicia, where it conflicted acutely with the ambitions of
France, and to satisfy it in western Asia Minor at the expense of
Russia and Greece who were helpless to resist.1 The agreement was confirmed by an exchange of notes between Great Britain, France and Italy in August. Even more than those of 1915 and 1916 it was a patched-up compromise of conflicting ambitions. It would almost certainly have broken down, above all over Franco-Italian rivalries in Cilicia, if a serious attempt had ever been made to apply it. It would also have encountered opposition from Greece, with whose ambitions in Asia Minor it was completely incompatible. Moreover if it had been put into force it would, combined with earlier agreements, have reduced the area under Turkish rule to a mere fragment of north and central Asia Minor, poor, undeveloped and almost without ports. This could never have provided the basis for a viable
state. With the agreement of St.-Jean-de-Maurienne the complex story of the secret treaties between the allies is really at an end. After the spring of 1917 the real question was whether and how far they would or could be applied. The whole situation was now being radically altered by the collapse of Russia, and to a lesser extent by the development of Arab nationalism and resulting changes in the attitude of Great Britain. The government headed by Prince Lvov which was brought into power by the Russian revolution of March 1917 shared many of the ambitions of the Tsarist regime in the Near East. In particular it was as anxious as its predecessor to see Russia in control of the Straits. Its Foreign Minister, Milyukov, carried on the policies formulated by Sazonov in 1914-16 and even pressed for the launching of a land attack on Constantinople from the port of Trebizond, which had been in Russian hands since February. But the internal condition of the country made this, or indeed a successful offensive anywhere, merely a dream. Milyukov’s resignation in mid-May, in face of increasingly violent opposition to his policy of maintaining and applying the secret treaties, marked the abandonment in Russia of the expansionist hopes of the previous three years. Alexander Kerenskii, who succeeded Lvov in July, and his Foreign Minister Tereshchenko, adopted a more realistic attitude. They did not wish to abandon the secret treaties altogether; but they hoped for their modification and suggested an inter-allied conference for this purpose. The collapse of Russia, however, had robbed her of the
? Neither of them accepted the agreement, and Russia’s failure to give her consent later allowed the British and French governments to argue at the peace conference that it had no binding force.

influence she had formerly wielded over Britain, France and Italy.
The morale of her people was disintegrating, the fighting spirit of
her armies evaporating. Peace and bread were now far more important and attractive than Constantinople. Even before the seizure of power by the Bolsheviks in November she had almost ceased to count in the diplomacy of the allies. The issue of the ‘Decree of Peace’ of 8 November, which demanded an immediate end to the war without annexations or indemnities, and the publication and denunciation of the secret treaties, merely completed a separation of Russia from the western powers which was already far advanced. By the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, of 3 March 1918, she surrendered to Germany vast territories in Poland, the Baltic provinces and the Ukraine. This, as well as the civil war which was now engulfing her, meant that apart from futile efforts to stimulate social revolution outside her borders she had now become a mere spectator of Near Eastern affairs. In April the Turks reoccupied without resistance all the territory in Anatolia and Armenia which they had lost in the previous three years. Moreover what influence Russia still possessed in the Near East was now increasingly thrown against her former allies. The structure of secret treaties built up so painfully was also being undermined by a growing unwillingness from the spring of 1917 onwards of the British government, or at least some of its agents, to apply the Sykes—Picot agreement in its entirety. A desire to realise some form of Arab unity was now gaining ground in London. It was increasingly felt that the agreement conceded too much to France (who had after all done much less than Great Britain to bring down the Ottoman Empire) and that it overrode too cavalierly the rights of the inhabitants of the provinces with which it dealt. In 1915 and even 1916 the very existence of Arab nationalism was almost unknown to western statesmen. By 1917 a vague realisation was growing that the areas in question, above all Syria, were precisely those parts of the Arab world in which foreign control was likely to be most resented. The part played in the changing British attitude by political idealism should not be exaggerated;but of the change there can be no doubt. In a telegram of 8 June 1917 to the Sharif Husain the High Commissioner for Egypt, Sir Reginald Wingate, made it clear that Britain was unlikely to apply the Sykes—Picot agreement in practice. More important, Lloyd George argued in a speech of 5 January 1918 that
the Russian collapse had altered the whole position in the Near East.
Armenia, Arabia, Syria and Palestine must have a ‘recognition of
their separate national conditions’: as for the partition treaties
345


1917 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 already made, he was ‘perfectly ready to discuss them with our
allies’. In France, however, there was still a powerful ‘Syrian’ party
in the Chamber of Deputies, led by Flandin and Franklin-Bouillon,
which hoped for French control of the whole area between the Mediterranean, the Euphrates and the Sinai peninsula. In November 1917 another entirely new element was injected into the situation when by the Balfour Declaration the British government declared its support for the establishment in Palestine of ‘a national home for the Jewish people...it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine’. The idea of Jewish settlement in Palestine under British auspices had begun to take shape early in 1915 when Herbert Samuel, the Home Secretary, who was himself a Jew, suggested it in a memorandum to the cabinet. The Prime Minister, Asquith, was unsympathetic; but a number of his colleagues — Haldane, Bryce, later Lord Milner — were attracted by the idea. The conception of a ‘National Home’ in Palestine continued however to be opposed, sometimes with real bitterness, by those Jews who saw their future rather in terms of assimilation to the peoples among whom they lived. This assimilationist opposition, which was also represented in the cabinet in the person of Edwin Montagu, the Secretary of State for India, was strong enough to make the government hesitate; the fact that in October 1917 the Chief Rabbi of the Jewish community in Britain, when asked for his opinion, came down in favour of the ‘National Home’ idea undoubtedly did something to turn the scales. Clearly the motives of the British government in issuing the declaration were not in the main altruistic. The frequently-repeated allegation that it was a bid for the support of American Jewry at a critical moment in the war contains a good deal of truth. There were in particular British fears of an effort by Germany to appeal to the sympathies of the American Jews; and Zimmermann, the German Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, had in fact proposed unsuccessfully in the spring of 1917 a joint pro-Zionist declaration by the German and Turkish governments.! It was also realised in London that there were strategic advantages in having a Britishprotected state on the eastern bank of the Suez Canal. In the spring and summer of 1917 there was in particular a strong feeling that support for the Zionists could be used to bring Palestine under British control after the war and as a means of baulking French claims there. Chaim Weizmann, the Zionist who had inspired

THE WAR OF 1914-18 1917 Samuel’s original initiative in 1915 and who was more than any other individual the driving force behind the issue of the declaration, stressed that “a reconstructed Palestine will become a very great asset to the British Empire’.1 More important still at the crucial moment was the mistaken belief that the tottering Kerenskii regime in Russia was largely under Jewish influence and that a pro-Jewish gesture might help to keep Russia in the war. But these motives were not the only ones at work. It is permissible to claim that a desire to assist an oppressed race? and perhaps a feeling, nourished by generations of Bible-reading, that possession of the Holy Land imposed on Britain special obligations and created for her new moral opportunities, were also of some importance. Nevertheless, as a recent historian of the declaration has pointed out, “a certain air of mystery still hides, and probably always will hide, the origin of this, the most unexpected action of State in our history’.* It encountered, as was to be expected, immediate opposition from the Arabs, who regarded it as the thin end of the wedge of Jewish domination in Palestine. Whether and how far it was incompatible with the pledges already given them is a complex and controversial question which need not be discussed here.® Its results are the clearest of all illustrations of the inadequacy of idealism in international affairs, the most striking of all proofs that good intentions are not enough. The weaknesses of the Young Turk regime and the inefficiency with which the Turkish war effort was organised had been apparent long before 1918. The cabinet was now so unimportant that during much of the war vacancies in it were left unfilled for months on end. Often only a third or less of its members were normally present when it met. In fact all pretence of parliamentary or cabinet government in the Ottoman Empire had been dropped. Enver controlled the war effort as a dictator; and civil affairs were increasingly dominated by the general council of the Party of Union and Progress, whose members drew official salaries and overshadowed the ministers. The genuine reforming impulse which had underlain the revolution of 1908 was not even now completely exhausted. Efforts were made to unify the currency and the differing
11,J.Stein, Weizmann and the Balfour Declaration (Rehovoth, 1964), p. 24. 2 Balfour, the Foreign Secretary, claimed in a private conversation in February 1918 that he and Lloyd George had been influenced by ‘a desire to give the Jews their rightful place in the world; a great nation without a home is not right’. (R. Meinertzhagen, Middle East Diary, 1917-1956 (London, 1959), p- 9-) 3 George V seems to have shared this attitude to some extent (ibid., p. 11). 4G.

systems of weights and measures in use in different areas, and to
spread the use of the Gregorian calendar. But economic strain and
administrative incompetence made constructive change impossible. The army fought well almost to the end. Its organisation and supply
system became increasingly chaotic, however, and its numbers shrank with terrible swiftness through losses and desertion. By the beginning of 1917 about 300,000 men had deserted: by the summer of 1918 the number had risen to over 500,000. ‘In 1918,’ wrote Liman von Sanders, ‘none of the so-called three armies on the Palestine front comprised as many combatants as a single Turkish infantry division had at the beginning of the war.) The country’s fragile economy was strained beyond bearing. Food shortages in Constantinople and other large towns were constant and increasingly severe. The transport system was collapsing. (In Palestine in 1918 olive trees and even vines were being used as fuel for railway engines, since coal was unobtainable and all other accessible timber had been consumed.) Nor was the government able even to control its own agents. Great officials in the provinces could delay for months or even prevent altogether the execution of orders from Constantinople. Djemal Pasha, as governor of Syria and commander of the forces in Palestine, went even further. In December 1915 he offered, in negotiations with Russia, to overthrow the Sultan and his ministers. He would then make himself ruler of Asiatic Turkey and set up autonomous states in Syria, Palestine, Mesopotamia, Arabia, Cilicia and Kurdistan. Nothing came of the proposal; but it was a striking illustration of the personal ambitions and administrative incoherence which always underlay the Young Turk regime. By the summer of 1918 there were unmistakable signs that, whatever happened to Germany and the rest of her allies, the Ottoman Empire could no longer continue the struggle. Some of the more extreme Turkish nationalists had now realised that the Arab provinces would be a source of weakness rather than of strength if any effort were made to maintain Turkish rule there. Halil Bey, the Foreign Minister, had already agreed in February, in answer to President Wilson’s Fourteen Points, that the nationalities of the empire should be granted institutions of their own. In a newspaper article published in March the writer Zia Goekalp, whose intellectual influence throughout the war had been very great, came out strongly in favour of Arab independence and the formation of a federation which might be joined by independent Arab and Turkish states.

June censorship of the press was made much less rigorous; in July

Bulgaria had surrendered a month earlier, thus exposing Constantinople to attack by the allied forces based on Salonika. Her sufferings, though less than those of Turkey, had been great. The harvests of 1916 and 1917 were bad. Though her battle-losses had not been particularly heavy an unprecedentedly high proportion of her male population was absorbed by the army — a crippling drain on her primitive economy. In the spring of 1917 the army leaders, with German support, had virtually taken control of the civil administration in an effort to intensify the country’s war effort. Nevertheless pro-Russian feeling remained widespread; and the high-handed attitude of the German government was deeply resented. In particular Bulgaria did not receive, as she had hoped, the whole of the Dobrudja after the collapse of Rumania at the end of 1916. Instead, when the central powers finally imposed very severe peace-terms on the Rumanians at Bucharest (May 1918) only the southern part of the province was given to her. The remainder was placed under the administration of the central powers as a whole; and this setback to Bulgaria’s ambitions did much to undermine the position of her Prime Minister, Radoslavov, and even of the king. In June Radoslavov resigned and was succeeded by Malinov, who was known to be favourable to the entente powers. Simultaneously the censorship of the press hitherto exercised by the army was abolished. When in September the allied forces at Salonika attacked northwards along the Vardar valley resistance to them rapidly
collapsed. On the 26th the German government at last conceded the Bulgarian claim to the whole of the Dobrudja; but too late. With mutineers attacking the headquarters of the army at Kustendil
and even threatening the capital, resistance was impossible. An
armistice was signed on 28 September. On 3 October King
Ferdinand, who with some members of the cabinet had refused to accept the armistice conditions, abdicated.

1917-18 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 The end of the war saw the whole of the Near East in great
confusion. In the Balkans the scramble for territory and the hatreds
it generated showed signs of becoming more acute than ever. Serbia,
swept out of existence at the end of 1915, was now re-establishing
herself. The disintegration of Austria-Hungary had freed most of
her territory; and the Serbian divisions advancing from Salonika
soon cleared Macedonia of Bulgarian troops. Her resurrection was to be expected: no allied country had fought more gallantly or suffered more than Serbia, and her liberation had become a wellestablished allied war aim. Less easy to foresee was the new and important South Slav state which was now taking shape with Serbia as its nucleus. The idea of such a state had always had much more support among the South Slavs of Austria-Hungary than among the Serbs themselves. Serbian leaders, above all Pashich, had usually tended to think of the future in terms merely of an enlarged Serbia; and in this attitude they had been supported by the Russian government, which wished the Orthodox Serbs to dominate the Catholic Croats and Dalmatians. The most important supporter of the Yugoslav idea, Trumbich, was a Dalmatian; and the Yugoslav Committee which he set up in Rome and which Italian hostility later compelled to move to London was composed of Slavs from the Habsburg Empire. Its relations with the refugee Serb government were often strained. Not until July 1917, by the Declaration of Corfu, did Pashich and the other members of that government come out unequivocally in favour of a Yugoslav state; and even then they did not commit themselves to giving it a federal structure. Even as late as January 1918 the Serbian Prime Minister seems to have reverted for a time to the idea of setting up merely a greater Serbia when victory had been won. Although a Yugoslav state to include Serbia, Montenegro,! Croatia and Bosnia was proclaimed on 1 December 1918, thus facing the allies with a fait accompli, its birth had not been easy and its future was not assured. Many Serbs, though they welcomed some form of union with Montenegro, were by no means anxious to link their fate with that of the Catholic Croats and Slovenes who bore the stamp of centuries of Habsburg rule. Above all the question of whether the new Yugoslavia should be a federation or a unitary (and therefore Serb-dominated) state was left unsolved. It was to poison the country’s political life for the next two decades.
The defeat of the central powers also paved the way for the
recovery by Rumania of the losses she had suffered by the treaty of

Bucharest, and for her acquisition of the gains promised her by the entente powers in the agreement of August 1916. Even before the end of the war, however, in a moment of extreme weakness and humiliation, she had received an extraordinary windfall of territory. The Bolshevik revolution of 1917 naturally produced a hostile reaction among the ruling classes of Bessarabia. A National Moldavian Committee had already been set up there in May; and in October it was succeeded by a Supreme Council for Bessarabia. In December the latter proclaimed an independent Moldavian Republic. On 8 April 1918 it voted for the union of Bessarabia with Rumania, which proceeded to occupy the province. The Bolsheviks refused to recognise this annexation, alleging that the vote was not truly representative of the will of the Bessarabian people.’ Nor did Britain and France recognise it till October 1920. But it was quite impossible to prevent it. Thus Rumania, after suffering a complete military defeat, was able to recoup some of her losses at the expense of an ex-ally and console herself with Bessarabia for what had been taken from her in the Dobrudja. The Bessarabian question was to dominate Russo—Rumanian relations for the next twenty years. Beside the fazts accomplis in Yugoslavia and Bessarabia the end of the war in the Balkans confronted the allies with a series of complex territorial disputes for which they must attempt to find solutions. These disputes were not primarily between victors and vanquished. Turkey was in complete collapse, quite unable to resist any demands that might be made on her. The feelings of Bulgaria and AustriaHungary need not be considered very seriously. The most acute conflicts of interest were rather between different members of the victorious coalition — between Yugoslavia? and Italy over the Dalmatian coast, between Yugoslavia and Rumania over the Banat, between Italy and Greece over the Dodecanese, Albania and rival ambitions in Asia Minor. The position in the Levant and Asia Minor was also complex, fluid and potentially explosive. On 4 October an independent Arab state of Syria had been proclaimed by the Emir Feisal, second son of the Sharif Husain. The government which he set up in Damascus received a kind of tacit recognition from General Allenby; but it was at once clear that friction between France and the new state was unavoidable. The British and French governments declared on g November that they would ‘encourage and assist the establishment
1 The Supreme Council was not an elected body. It consisted of representatives nominated by the army, peasant congresses and professional groups. 2 The name Yugoslavia was not in official use till 1929. Till then the state was known as the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.

territories for whose liberation they are striving’. This promise was
understood by the Arab leaders as superseding the Sykes—Picot
agreement: it was not interpreted in this way in Paris. Again, would
their claims in Asia Minor lead France and Italy into conflict in spite
of the effort to regulate them at St. Jean de Maurienne? Would either of these powers be able or even willing to make good these claims in the reaction from the efforts and losses of the war which was now setting in? Above all would they be willing to accept the dominant position which Britain had now achieved in the area? British troops at the end of the war were in control of Palestine, Syria and Mesopotamia. They were advancing on Mosul and a small British force had even been established, rather insecurely, at Baku. The armistice of Mudros had been signed by a British naval officer (Admiral Calthorpe, commander of the Mediterranean squadron) and the French and Italian governments were informed of its terms only after the signature. The situation was complicated by the existence of a whole series of intractable problems — the growing nationalism and anti-British feeling in Egypt; the desire of the Turkish Armenians, or at least of their leaders, for independence; the emergence after the revolution of 1917 of Georgia and the Russian parts of Armenia and Azerbaijan as precariously independent states; the separatism of the Kurds; and the anti-entente and above all anti-British propaganda now being disseminated by the Bolsheviks. The position of the great powers most deeply involved, France, Italy and Great Britain, was made difficult by other factors. They were bound to one another by the secret agreements on the making of which so much diplomatic energy had been expended from the spring of 1915 onwards, agreements which none of them was willing to denounce. Yet these at least appeared to contradict other promises they had made during the war, notably the Anglo-French declaration of support for Arab independence of 9 November 1918. They were impossible to reconcile with the idea of self-determination for all national groups which had been embodied in President Wilson’s Fourteen Points and accepted in principle by America’s allies. Also all the allied governments were now faced with the insistent demands of their subjects for immediate demobilisation. These it was politically impossible to reject. Yet by surrendering to them the governments concerned were destroying their power to control physically, if necessary, strategic or disputed areas, and thus impose a settlement of their own creation. The generals had done their work: the diplomats had now to set about theirs, in many ways the more difficult task of the two.
352


CHAPTER TWELVE
The Peace Settlement
1918-23
For the sake of simplicity the problems of the settlement may be considered under three geographical headings: the Balkans; the Turkish or mainly Turkish areas (eastern Thrace, Constantinople and the Straits, and Anatolia) ; and the Arab parts of the Ottoman Empire. The greater part of the Balkan settlement was embodied in three treaties: those of Saint Germain (10 September 1919) by which the allies made peace with Austria; of Neuilly (27 November 1919) by which they made peace with Bulgaria; and of Trianon (4 June, 1920) by which they made peace with Hungary. These gave large territorial gains to Yugoslavia, Greece and Rumania. By the settlement with Austria Yugoslavia acquired Styria and Carniola. By the treaty of Neuilly she obtained from Bulgaria some small but strategically valuable territories (the Struma, Tsaribrod and Bosiligrad salients) which made her eastern frontier much more defensible. Finally from Hungary she secured by the treaty of Trianon the area known as the Bachka and the western third of the Banat of Temesvar. Rumania acquired from Hungary Transylvania, the Bukovina and the remainder of the Banat, and from Bulgaria the Dobrudja — gains which roughly doubled her territory and which were strikingly out of proportion to her disappointing military performance. Greece for her part eventually acquired from Bulgaria the whole of western Thrace as a somewhat delayed result of the treaty of Neuilly. The Balkan settlement was carried out in face of the pleas and protests of the defeated states. These, however, could be disregarded without difficulty when the allies felt justified in doing so. Thus they rejected the request of Hungary and Bulgaria for the holding of plebiscites in the areas which they were condemned to lose, and almost certainly committed no real injustice in doing so. The drawing-up of terms of peace was much more seriously impeded by a series of acrimonious inter-allied disputes. Of these the most
353


1918-19 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
important and prolonged was that between Italy and Yugoslavia over the port of Fiume and parts of the Adriatic coast and its offshore islands. There was also a short-lived but violent burst of antagonism between Rumania and her allies over her claims to the whole of the Banat. Finally there were less important inter-allied disagreements over the fate of western Thrace and Albania. The Italian government had never favoured the creation of a large Slav state on the eastern shores of the Adriatic. Such a state would be a competitor for control of Albania (over which the treaty of London had envisaged an Italian protectorate) as well as for the Dalmatian coastline. A political union of the South Slavs had not been regarded as a serious possibility in Rome until the later stages of the war. Till then it had been assumed, as in London and Paris, that the Habsburg Empire, in some form at least, would survive the struggle. Even when the creation of a Yugoslav state began to appear likely the idea was not at first in Italy received with open hostility. An official Congress of Oppressed Nationalities composed largely of representatives of the Slav peoples of the Habsburg Empire was allowed to meet in Rome early in April 1918; and from it emerged the equally unofficial ‘Pact of Rome’, which demanded in very general terms the achievement of unity and self-determination by both the Italian and South Slav peoples when victory had been won. Later, on 8 September, the Italian government proclaimed that ‘Italy considers that the movement of the Yugoslav people for independence and for the constitution of a free state corresponds to the principles for which the Allies are fighting and to the aims of a just and lasting peace’. This appearance of harmony was, however, quite deceptive. The Italian government had allowed the holding of the Congress largely because it hoped to use it to shake the loyalty to the Habsburgs of the Croat regiments then facing the Italian army in the Alps. It refused to take any official part in its activities. It also refused to allow its South Slav prisoners of war to join the Serbian army, as many of them were eager to do. The declaration of 8 September was the product of the government’s need to appease its domestic liberal opponents rather than of any conversion to the cause of South Slav unity. When the peace conference at last got under way in Paris in January 1919 Italy ostentatiously refused to recognise the new Yugoslav state and the right of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to be represented as a unit. Increasingly South Slav union seemed to Italian politicians a danger which, if it could not be avoided, must be guarded against by giving Italy the best possible strategic frontier in the north-east.
354


THE PEACE SETTLEMENT, 1918-23 1919 A new source of friction was thus introduced into the situation. Italy laid claim in Paris not merely to the great gains promised her by the treaty of London but also to the port of Fiume which, she contended, was an Italian city. This claim was at once violently rejected by the Yugoslavs. Fiume itself, it was argued, might have a somewhat doubtful Italian majority, but it could not in practice be separated from its hinterland, still less from its suburb of Susak; and both of these were overwhelmingly Slav. Italy’s position, moreover, was weak in other ways. Her claim to Fiume was based on the right of its Italian inhabitants to unity with Italy, in other words on the right of self-determination which was still so pathetically believed by so many people to be the key to world peace. Yet Italy showed no hesitation in disregarding this right elsewhere when it suited her to do so (for example in the South Tyrol with its solid German majority). In fact she was adhering, and demanding that Britain and France should adhere, to the wartime secret treaties when she had something to gain by doing so; and simultaneously asserting, in the case of Fiume, a principle quite irreconcilable with them. Her attitude was illogical and it is easy to understand the failure of her allies to sympathise with her. Of the details of the dispute over Fiume it is unnecessary to say very much here. Trumbich, the chief Yugoslav delegate at Paris, offered early in February 1919 to leave the Italo—Yugoslav frontier to be decided by the arbitration of President Wilson; but the Italians at once refused. This was not surprising, for Wilson, though he had surrendered to Italian pressure over the South Tyrol, was known to be hostile to Italy’s demands in the Adriatic. The result was that fruitless and increasingly acrimonious negotiations went on throughout the summer. On 23 April Wilson attempted to impose a solution by appealing over the head of the Italian government to the Italian people. In a public declaration he asked it to support his proposals for a settlement. The manoeuvre was a complete failure. The Italian delegates at Paris withdrew from the conference for a few days as a calculated gesture of outrage, while the Italian press rallied to their support and heaped abuse on the President. Finally the deadlock was broken by violence. At the beginning of July there were riots in Fiume in which a number of French soldiers of the
1 The Italian argument was that Fiume had been left by the treaty of London as part of Croatia since a union of the Serbs and Croats had not been envisaged in 1915. Now that that union had been accomplished Croatia could find an outlet to the Adriatic through Serbia. See the note of Tittoni, the Italian Prime Minister, to Lloyd George, of 7 July, 1919, in E. L. Woodward and R. Butler (eds.) Documents

allied occupation force were killed. On 12 September the Italian poet and extreme nationalist, Gabriele D’Annunzio, seized the city with a band of volunteer followers. It was a political impossibility for any of the weak and unpopular governments which succeeded each other in Italy during the next three years to abandon it to Yugoslavia even if they had wanted to. As a result of this position the treaties of Saint Germain and Trianon provided merely that Austria and Hungary should cede the area in dispute to the allies as a whole, and not to any single state, since its final fate was still in doubt. The passage of time steadily weakened the Yugoslav position. Negotiations in May 1920 between Trumbich and Nitti, the Italian Prime Minister, were made fruitless by the fall of Nitti’s cabinet immediately afterwards. The formal repudiation of Wilson’s policies by the American people in the presidential election of November 1920 confirmed what was already cle—atrhat Yugoslavia could expect no help from the United States. On the rath of that month, nevertheless, the Italian—Yugoslav treaty of Rapallo seemed to offer some hope of a solution based on concessions by both sides. Italy was to receive most of Istria, as well as Zara and some of the Dalmatian islands — in other words considerably more Slav territory than Wilson had been willing to allow her. The much-disputed Fiume was to become a free city; and D’Annunzio, after a number of flamboyant gestures, was forced to evacuate it in January 1921. The treaty, however, proved impossible to apply in the atmosphere of exacerbated nationalism which now surrounded the whole dispute; and acute Italo-Yugoslav friction continued till 1924. By then the Yugoslavs had lost heart and resigned themselves to defeat. A treaty with Italy signed on 27 January gave her Fiume: Yugoslavia obtained merely the suburb of Susak. This solution of the question had many defects. It left the Yugoslavs with a strong and largely justified sense of grievance. It was administratively untidy, since Fiume and Susak were separated by no clear-cut boundary. It was harmful to Fiume, which saw itself cut off by a political frontier from its natural hinterland and its commercial interests sacrificed by the Italian government to those of its rival Trieste. Nevertheless it was a solution of a sort, though it was unlikely to be a permanent one. The friction aroused by struggles for possession of the Banat of Temesvar was as violent as that over Fiume but shorter-lived. By the secret treaty of August 1916 Rumania had been promised the whole of the Banat; and at Paris Bratianu, who led her delegation, fought tenaciously to hold the allies to their promise. For a number of reasons he failed. The greatest barrier to the admission of the

Rumanian claim was that the area was very mixed ethnically, perhaps even more mixed than Macedonia: it included in its population not merely Rumanians but also large numbers of Serbs, Hungarians and Germans. The Rumanians were the largest of these groups, taking the area as a whole, but they were far from being an absolute majority of the population. With President Wilson this argument weighed heavily, since America was not a party to the 1916 agreement and had never given it any official recognition. Even Britain and France, however, which had signed the agreement, could now find respectable reasons for refusing to apply it. One of its clauses had bound the signatories not to make a separate peace with the central powers; and this had been violated by Rumania’s signature of the treaty of Bucharest in May 1918. It was true that the treaty had not been ratified by the Rumanian government. Nevertheless that government had declared war on Germany on 9 November (only two days before the end of the conflict) on the pretext that the German government had violated it by stationing in Rumania an army of occupation larger than its terms permitted. This was a serious error. By basing her declaration of war on the terms of the treaty of Bucharest Rumania admitted by implication its validity. But if she had concluded a valid peace treaty with the enemy she had undoubtedly broken one of the most important articles of the 1916 agreement and thus forfeited her claims under it. Her position throughout the negotiations in Paris was therefore legally weak. The achievement of her ambitions was also hampered by the fact that the armistice with Hungary, which the French general Franchet D’Esperey had concluded at Belgrade on 3 November 1918, allowed the Serbian army to occupy the whole of the Bachka and Banat. The Serbs had therefore the considerable advantage of being in physical control of the area in dispute. Before the peace conference opened in Paris in January 1919 the Rumanian politician Také Jonescu, realising that Rumania could no longer hope for the whole of the Banat, had made an informal and statesmanlike agreement with Pashich for its partition. But the Rumanian press got wind of this and denounced the agreement so violently that it had to be abandoned. Jonescu, probably the ablest man in Rumanian political life, was not included in the delegation to Paris. There Bratianu’s obstinacy and the poor personal impression he made! rapidly antagonised the allied representatives. ‘Their
dislike was intensified by events. In March 191g the liberal
1‘Bratianu’, noted Harold Nicolson, then a Foreign Office official attached to
the British delegation, ‘is a bearded woman, a forceful humbug, a Bucharest
intellectual, a most unpleasing man.’ (Peacemaking, 1919 (London, 1945), p- 202).

government which had been set up in Hungary by Count Michael
Karolyi after the collapse of the previous October fell in its turn. It
was succeeded by a largely Communist regime led by Bela Kun which organised a Red Army and showed itself willing to fight for what it believed to be Hungarian territory. The Rumanian forces in Transylvania at once drove Kun’s troops back to the river Tisza and early in August, against the orders of the allies, occupied Budapest. Relations between Rumania and the western powers were now very bad. In June, when it was announced that part of the Banat was to go to Serbia, Bratianu followed the example of the Italian delegates some weeks earlier and withdrew from the peace conference. He refused to sign the treaty of Saint Germain and resigned his position as Prime Minister in protest against it. He also refused to sign the treaty guaranteeing the rights of minorities which the allies were now imposing on all the successor-states of the Ottoman and Habsburg Empires. This attitude, coupled with the reluctance of the Rumanians to evacuate Hungary and the wholesale requisitioning in which they indulged there, produced intense exasperation in Paris. At last on 24 November the allies presented an ultimatum in Bucharest. Unless the settlement they had so laboriously drawn up were accepted they would break off diplomatic relations with Rumania. This produced the desired result. The minorities treaty was signed on g December; and under Bratianu’s successor, the young and relatively liberal Vaida-Voevod, relations with the western powers improved rapidly. The conflicts produced by the Banat question and the issues associated with it were thus acute rather than lasting. Western Thrace and Albania did not arouse the violent passions generated by Fiume and the Banat; but both led to disagreement among the allies and both raised problems which took time to solve. The question of western Thrace can be briefly dismissed. Great Britain, France and Italy were all in favour of handing it over to Greece; and the Committee on Greek Territorial Affairs set up by the peace conference recommended on 6 March 1919 that the transfer should be made. This however meant depriving Bulgaria of any outlet of her own to the Aegean; and such a result the United States (which, it is important to remember, had never been at war with Bulgaria or Turkey) was unwilling to accept. The population of the area included Turks and Pomaks (Moslem Bulgarians) as well
as Greeks and Bulgars, and its very mixed character complicated
the problem. So did the fact that it had not yet been decided whether
the Turks should be allowed to retain any territory at all in Europe.
These difficulties led to the dropping of the whole issue by the
358


THE PEACE SETTLEMENT, 1918-23 1916-20 conference during the four months which followed the report of 6 March. When it was taken up once more the Americans, with some Italian support, proposed to leave Bulgaria in possession of western Thrace. Later Wilson suggested that most of the area be incorporated in the mandatory zone which it was proposed to create around Constantinople. Neither of these solutions proved acceptable to Britain and France. Suggestions that Bulgaria might be granted special facilities at the port of Dedeagatch failed to shake Wilson’s attitude. So did the argument that when the Straits were placed under international control (as all the allies were agreed they should be) it would be no real hardship for Bulgaria to be confined to a Black Sea coastline. The result was that recourse was had, in the treaty with Bulgaria, to the device which had already been used over Fiume and Dalmatia. At Neuilly the Bulgarian government ceded its former possessions in Thrace to the allies as a whole, and an allied (mainly French) occupying force continued to be maintained there. The area was finally transferred to Greece only in August 1920; by then American influence on the affairs of Europe had become almost negligible. The fate of Albania aroused rather more acute disagreement between the allies. The country had for long been regarded in Rome as a natural sphere of Italian influence, indeed as a natural Italian protectorate. At the end of 1914 Valona, its main port, had been occupied by Italian troops. Other countries, however, also cherished ambitions there. Serbia and Montenegro had claims to Albanian territory: above all Greece had for long contended that the southern part of the country (Northern Epirus in the terminology favoured in Athens) was mainly Greek in population and should belong to her. In April 1916 King Constantine had proclaimed its annexation; but a few months later it was occupied by French and Italian troops who were still there when the war ended. Albania was thus a field for many conflicting ambitions; and the backwardness of the population and the difficulties of communication made it almost impossible to discover the real wishes of its inhabitants.+ That the country emerged from the tensions and confusion of the peace settlement as an independent state was the work of the United States and the Albanians themselves. But for them Italy and Greece would probably have ended their rivalry in the most natural way by a partition of the country between them. Such a partition was indeed provided for in an agreement made by Venizelos and Tittoni, the chief Italian delegate to the peace conference, at the end of July

1919. By this Italy promised to support Greek claims in northern Epirus: in return Greece was to support the annexation of Valona by Italy and the grant to her of a mandate for the rest of the country. In January 1920 Lloyd George and Clemenceau agreed with Nitti on another scheme of division which gave part of northern Albania to the Yugoslavs. Against these partition projects Wilson was able to muster powerful and convincing arguments based on selfdetermination which were given point by the growth of Albanian nationalism. The painful and hesitant development of national feeling in the country from the 1870s onwards was now bearing fruit. A National Legislative Assembly met at Tirana in March 1920; and in the months which followed a rudimentary Albanian government began slowly to take shape. The Albanians were helped, moreover, by the weakness and preoccupations elsewhere of their would-be masters. Greece was now deeply involved in her disastrous Anatolian adventure.! The Yugoslavs were interested above all in Fiume. Italy was suffering from intense war-weariness and great economic difficulties. By the summer of 1920 her forces had been confined to Valona; at the beginning of August she agreed to evacuate the country entirely; by September the evacuation had taken place. Greek and Yugoslav troops were not withdrawn till the following year and the frontiers of Albania were not definitely fixed till 1926; but of her formal independence there was no longer serious question.” If the political frontiers of the Balkan states in 1920 are compared with those of 1913 the changes are much less than might have been expected after so long and bitter a war. Really drastic alterations had been confined in the main to a belt of territory (Bessarabia, the Bukovina, Transylvania, the Banat, Croatia, Styria, Carniola, Dalmatia) which belonged to central and east-central Europe rather than to the Balkans proper. In the Balkan peninsula the changes of 1918-20 to a large extent merely reasserted the frontiers of 1913. The area now consisted of a group of small or medium-sized nation-states, each based on territory populated by people of the same language and outlook. Between these indisputably ‘national’ areas existed and would continue to exist disputed ones (Macedonia, the Dobrudja, Thrace) some of which were of great importance. Everywhere it was possible to find unfulfilled territorial ambitions (above all in Bulgaria, again vanquished in war and from the territorial point of view the most unlucky of the Balkan states). But the existence of these well-established national groups, self-conscious, sometimes

xenophobic, often intractable, set definite limits to the extent to
which frontiers could now be easily or permanently changed. From the economic point of view the exacerbated nationalism produced by the war and by a peace settlement based on the idea of self-determination was almost wholly bad. New tariff barriers disrupted trade; new frontiers impeded communications;! traditional hatreds too often expressed themselves in destructive beggar-myneighbour policies; national pride was too often shown in struggles to set up inefficient industries producing shoddy goods with the help of capital wrung from a poverty-stricken peasantry.
Turkey accepted the armistice of Mudros in October 1918: her representatives were compelled by the allies to sign the peace-treaty of Sévres only in August 1920. The fact that this attempt at a settlement followed the armistice only after so long a delay explains its failure and the partial defeat for the allies which that failure involved. A number of factors helped to cause the delay. During much of 1919 the allies were preoccupied above all with the drawing-up of the peace with Germany; and even after the treaty of Versailles had been signed its practical application, particularly with respect to reparations, continued to take up much of their attention. The division of the Habsburg Empire and the redrawing of Balkan frontiers also absorbed time and effort which might otherwise have gone into the elaboration of a Turkish settlement. But the long delay must be attributed above all to the dejusive hope that the United States might accept a mandate under the newly-created League of Nations for the Armenian state which all the allies agreed should be set up, and perhaps also for Constantinople and the Straits area. Wilson refused on 6 May 1919, in reply to a suggestion of Lloyd George, to send any American troops to help in the occupation of Turkey, though on the 14th he agreed, subject to approval by the Senate, to American mandates for Constantinople and Armenia. But he never made it clear to the European allies how deeply American opinion was opposed to the acceptance of any responsibilities in the Near East. When he left Paris at the end of June 1919 to return home he expected to be able to tell the peace conference by August or September at the latest whether America would accept any Near Eastern mandates. Soon, however, the growth of American feeling against involvement in European
affairs, the Senate’s rejection of the treaty of Versailles and the

President’s illness, made it clear that there was no possibility of her
doing so. In June 1920 Congress formally refused to accept such
a mandate; but the withdrawal of the United States from all Near
Eastern responsibilities had become obvious long before this. Preoccupations elsewhere and the hopes placed in America are not, however, a complete explanation of the delay in imposing peace terms on Turkey. It had become clear by the early autumn of 1919 that little was to be hoped from the United States; yet the treaty of Sévres was presented to the Turkish delegates for signature not far short of two years later. For this further delay three other factors must be blamed — the complexity of the situation in Anatolia and the Straits region; the rivalries and conflicts of interest which divided the allies; and a widespread feeling that the Turks must accept any terms imposed on them and that there was thus no great need for haste. The complexity of the situation was greatest in eastern Anatolia and the Caucasus. Here the collapse first of the Russian and then of the Ottoman Empire had paved the way for a sudden proliferation of small states or would-be states, all of them weak, poor, vulnerable and clamorous for allied support. In the Russian part of the Caucasus an independent Transcaucasian Republic came into existence in April 1918: but within a few weeks it had dissolved into the republics of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. The two last were almost at once overrun by the Turkish army but had reasserted themselves by the end of the year: all three sent delegations to Paris to safeguard their interests and solicit support. Their existence created a number of problems for the allies. In the first place, should they be recognised as independent states? The leaders of the anti-Bolshevik struggle then in progress in Russia, Admiral Kolchak and General Denikin, were strongly opposed to this.t Largely for this reason the Caucasian republics received no formal allied recognition till January 1920. Again, if they were to be established as independent states, how were their frontiers to be drawn? This was a particularly difficult question where Armenia was concerned. In 1915 and 1916 a new series of massacres and deportations by the Turks, much worse even than those of 1895-6, had destroyed a great part of the Armenian population of Asia Minor. It was widely felt at Paris that the Armenians could never be safe except in a state of their own, with their own institutions and army, and that some restitution must be made for their appalling sufferings in the last generation. Yet it was impossible to create a

viable and defensible Armenia which did not include within its borders large numbers of Turks or Kurds. The schemes put forward by Boghos Nubar Pasha, the leader of the Armenian delegation at Paris, for a state extending from the Black Sea and the Persian frontier to the Mediterranean at Alexandretta were never seriously considered. But even when these extravagances had been discarded serious problems remained. Should the fortress-city of Erzerum be included in Armenia, in spite of its overwhelmingly Turkish population, to give the new state greater security ?Should the area known as Lazistan, in the extreme north-east of Asia Minor, become an autonomous republic under Armenian suzerainty? Should Batum be made a free city under the tutelage of the League of Nations as Danzig had been by the treaty of Versailles? Were the Kurds to be given some form of autonomy ?Answers to these questions had to be found, often with the help of very incomplete if not misleading information about the ethnic and linguistic make-up of the area and the wishes of its inhabitants. Side by side with these questions went others affecting the western parts of Anatolia. Were the Turks to be allowed to keep any territory in Europe? Protracted discussion of this problem ended early in January 1920 in a decision that the Sultan should be allowed to retain Constantinople as his capital. If the Straits were to be placed under some form of international regime, as Britain and France had agreed by December 1919, how was it to be organised ?Was Greece to acquire the Smyrna area in full sovereignty? It is easy to understand the reluctance which the allies showed to attempt the rapid solution of such difficult problems. Their difficulties were increased, moreover, by the suspicion with which they increasingly tended to regard each other’s activities in the Near East. Great Britain and France, whose relations were being seriously strained by the position in Syria, found it difficult to achieve harmonious co-operation in Constantinople. As early as the beginning of July 1919 Lord Curzon, the British Foreign Secretary, suspected that the French were trying to achieve a dominant position in Turkey and that the Italians might also ‘have a little intrigue’ there at Britain’s expense. Simultaneously there were signs that a new scramble for railway and mining concessions might be imminent. The slowness with which the Turkish settlement was drawn up was important above all because it made possible a remarkable
growth of Turkish nationalism from the spring and summer of 1919
onwards. It was this which allowed Turkey, apparently crushed
beyond hope of recovery, to regain her strength, reject the terms

1919 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 imposed on her by the treaty of Sévres, and at last negotiate peace with the allies at Lausanne in 1923 virtually on terms of equality. Her recovery was one of the most remarkable events of the twentieth century. At the end of 1918, with the Sultan a powerless nonentity, with a weak pro-allied government installed in Constantinople, with the country utterly exhausted and its people deep in apathy and despair, the allies could have imposed almost any terms they chose.* A year later, perhaps even six months later, this opportunity had gone for ever. By November 1919, faced by the rapid growth of the nationalist movement, Curzon was beginning to fear that ‘the weakest and most abject of our foes would end by achieving the greatest triumph’.”He was to prove a good prophet. This sudden burst of Turkish national feeling was the result, not of the collapse of October 1918, but of the landing of Greek troops at Smyrna on 15 May 1919. This had been preceded, at the end of April, by the landing in Adalia of an Italian force, a rather halfhearted attempt to assert Italy’s claims under the treaty of London to a sphere of influence in southern Asia Minor. The British, French and American governments authorised the Greek landing (which was covered by their warships) partly because they feared an Italian seizure of Smyrna if Greece were not allowed to act. They were also influenced by the extremely doubtful statistics produced by Venizelos, whose record as a friend of the entente gave him considerable personal prestige, to show that the Smyrna area was mainly Greek in population.’ But whatever their motives they had quite unwittingly revolutionised the position in Asia Minor. Defeat and occupation by the British and French armies appeared a disaster to nearly all Turks: it was not, however, shameful or dishonourable. Occupation by the despised Greeks, by rayah whom they had so often defeated in the past, was an unbearable insult: anger mixed with fear began to unite the population of Anatolia against these new invaders and their backers in western Europe.* Increasingly the Sultan and his ministers seemed mere puppets of the allies; and their authority,

Certainly the vilayet of Aidin, of which it was the principal town, had one though it also included a considerable Greek minority. *One of the British representatives in Constantinople described the hostility between Greeks and Turks, on 17 August 1919, as ‘an animosity which has to be seen to be believed, which is as unreasoning as it is rabid, and which is gradually becoming pretty nearly unquenchable’.

never very securely based in the interior of the country, began to evaporate. Moreover the indefiniteness of the whole situation, the prolonged uncertainty as to the peace terms with which they would be confronted, increased the alarm of many Turks and made violent action to strengthen their position seem increasingly attractive. This action was led by Mustapha Kemal, the outstanding figure in the history of twentieth-century Turkey and perhaps the only truly outstanding figure in the country’s history since the days of the Kiuprili Viziers in the seventeenth century or even Suleiman the Magnificent. As an army officer he had fought with great distinction at the Dardanelles in 1915 and later in Palestine and Syria. As an opponent of German influence in Turkey and of Enver’s wild expansionist schemes, however, he was free from any association in the public mind with the regime which had collapsed in 1918, Soon after the end of the war he was in Constantinople, to which he had been recalled by Izzet Pasha. On 15 May 1919, as the Greeks began disembarking at Smyrna, the Sultan, Mehmed VI Vahdeddin, sent him to eastern Anatolia as Inspector of the Third Army. There he began to act independently of the government in Constantinople and to make himself a centre of nationalist and anti-allied feeling. In particular he opened negotiations with General Kazim Karabekir Pasha, the commander of the Fifteenth Army Corps at Erzerum, who had already shown signs of sympathy with the idea of national resistance to the allies. Events now moved rapidly. On 8 July Kemal was dismissed from his post by the Sultan. On the 23rd a congress of delegates representing the eastern vilayets of Anatolia met at Erzerum, a sign that the nationalist movement was beginning to take an organised and institutional form, and elected him as its chairman. It was followed by the assembly of another congress at Sivas early in September; and this, in significant contrast to its predecessor, claimed to represent the whole of Turkey, including Turkey in Europe. Once more Kemal was elected as chairman; and on 9 September the delegates adopted a declaration demanding the recognition by the allies of the integrity of Turkish territory within the frontiers set by the armistice terms. This meant an end to efforts to create an Armenian state and to the allied and Greek occupation. A Union for the Defence of the Rights of Anatolia and Rumelia was formed; and the Congress set up a Representative Committee with Kemal as president. An alternative regime in rivalry with that of the Sultan in Constantinople was thus taking shape in Anatolia. On 11 September Kemal informed the allies that the Constantinople government was not representative of
Turkey and was merely an illegal tyranny. He also ordered that
365


1919 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 taxes should no longer be paid to it and that civilian officials loyal to it should be replaced by reliably nationalist army officers. The Grand Vizier, Damad Ferid Pasha, naturally wished to send
his forces against the Kemalists in an effort to destroy them. This the allies, after some discussion, refused to allow. They did not wish to find themselves with a civil war in Anatolia on their hands, particularly since it might be accompanied by further massacres of Christians in the area. Moreover there was a very real danger that the soldiers sent against Mustapha Kemal would desert to him. The allied attitude was understandable; but it made the position of Damad Ferid Pasha quite impossible. On 1 October he resigned, to be followed as Grand Vizier by Ali Riza Pasha. The new government, reported the British High Commissioner in Constantinople, ‘will certainly remain in power only so long as in internal affairs and in the main tendency of their foreign policy they dance to the pipings of the authors of the national movement’.! When elections for a new Turkish parliament were held in December they gave a majority to the nationalists: it was clear that events were escaping from allied control. British and French seapower could have little direct effect in the inaccessible interior of Anatolia. Only military operations on a considerable scale could now crush Kemal and his followers (and even then the nationalists would almost certainly wage a prolonged guerilla war for independence). For such operations the allies lacked both the means and the will. Even the maintenance of the weak British garrisons which had been established in Batum and Baku in the last months of the war was now beyond their capacity. Had Tsarist Russia survived the war she would have been able, with her army in control of eastern Anatolia, to crush with ease any Turkish nationalist aspirations there. But Russia was, for the time being, destroyed as a major military power: the Bolsheviks were even more hostile to the entente than Kemal. The resurgence of Turkey was thus a result, though an indirect one, of the 1917 revolution. As the strength of his position became clearer Kemal became less and less willing to compromise with his opponents. Until late in 1919 he might have been willing to consider an American or even some form of French mandate for Turkey in return for the support of one of these powers against his most dangerous enemies, the Greeks and the British. As the nationalist movement gained impetus, however, these ideas were quickly dropped. At the end of the year he moved his headquarters from Sivas to Ankara, where the nationalist members of the new parliament drew up the National Pact. This in

THE PEACE SETTLEMENT, 1918-23 1920 effect repeated the declaration issued at Sivas. It demanded, however, in addition to the Sivas terms, the incorporation in Turkey of the Kurdish areas of eastern Anatolia and plebiscites to decide the fate of Kars, Batum, Ardahan and the Turkish part of Thrace. When on 28 January 1920 the newly-elected Turkish parliament, meeting in Constantinople, confirmed the National Pact by a large majority, it was clear that the influence of the allies would be destroyed unless active steps were taken to restore it. On 3 March they forced Ali Riza Pasha to resign: he was succeeded a few days later by Salih Pasha, the Minister of Marine. On 16 March they jointly occupied Constantinople and arrested about 150 nationalist deputies and sympathisers. On 5 April Damad Ferid Pasha became Grand Vizier once more. On 11 April the Sheikh-ul-Islam was made to denounce Kemal and his followers as rebels. Next day the Sultan dissolved parliament: many of its members fled to Kemal’s headquarters at Ankara, where on the 23rd, together with a larger number of Kemalist deputies elected at the end of March, they met as the Grand National Assembly. A few days later the Assembly elected Kemal as president of its executive committee. These were the last steps needed to convert the nationalists into a separate government. The Sultan and his ministers in Constantinople were now more than ever mere puppets of the foreigner. Nevertheless the prestige of the ruler and of the Sheikh-ul-Islam were still great enough to mobilise against Kemal and his followers the powerful forces of religious conservatism. Irregular troops of various kinds more or less under the control of the government in Constantinople continued for several weeks to press the nationalists hard, even raiding in the neighbourhood of Ankara itself. What finally destroyed the moral authority of the Sultan was the peace terms which the allies were now forcing him to accept. The work of drawing up a peace treaty with Turkey had at last got under way. Slowly and painfully its terms had been hammered out, largely by a conference held in London in February and March 1920. They were given their final form by another at San Remo in April. It was agreed, after much discussion and in face of strong opposition from the Turcophobe Lloyd George, that the Sultan should be left in possession of Constantinople and of ‘Thrace up to the Chataldja line. But the Straits were to be controlled by an
international commission in which Turkey would play only a minor
role and were to be open to the ships (including warships) of all nations. An Armenian state with access to the sea was to be created, its frontiers with Turkey to be decided by the arbitration of President
Wilson. All the Arab parts of the Ottoman Empire as it had existed
367


1920 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 in 1914 — Syria, Palestine, Mesopotamia, the Hedjaz — were to be
surrendered. The islands of Imbros and Tenedos were to go to
Greece. The Smyrna area was to remain formally under Turkish sovereignty but was to be administered by Greece for the next five years. It was to have a local representative assembly of its own; and at the end of five years it might become Greek territory if this assembly, or the population of the area by a plebiscite, so wished. Apart from these losses of territory, actual or potential, Turkey was to suffer still further restrictions. Her finances were to be placed under the joint control of Britain, France and Italy, since they alone would be represented on the Council of the Ottoman Debt. Virtually all aspects of her economic life would be under powerful foreign influence. These very severe terms were presented to a delegation representing the government in Constantinople on 11 May and were accepted by it, under protest, on 10 August. It was already clear that their enforcement would be enormously difficult. In April Marshal Foch, to whom the conference at London had appealed for advice, reported that an army of 27 divisions would be needed to make Turkey accept such sacrifices and humiliations; and even if Greece were willing to make a large contribution a force of this size simply could not be raised. Already in February the nationalists had shown their strength by driving the French from Marash, one of the main towns occupied by them in Cilicia; and the severity of the peace terms did more than anything else could to rally Turkish opinion behind Mustapha Kemal. Lloyd George, now increasingly isolated from his French and Italian colleagues, argued that the Turks might be forced to submit merely by the occupation of a number of seaports and other strategic points in Asia Minor, and that ‘the Turks were no longer a formidable people’. But these assertions carried little conviction. The march of events was now steadily strengthening Kemal and his followers. When in June 1920 Venizelos offered to use the Greek army to crush the nationalists Italian fears of Greek influence in Asia Minor led to the rejection of the proposal by the allies, in spite of the desire of the British government to accept it. More serious, the elections held in Greece early in November inflicted a decisive and totally unexpected defeat on the Venizelists. The way was thus opened for the return to the throne of King Constantine in the following month.! This produced a sharply unfavourable reaction in London and Paris, where memories of Constantine’s equivocal if
? His son, King Alexander, had died on 25 October. It will be remembered that Constantine, when he left the country over three years earlier, made no formal renunciation of the throne (see p. 336 n. 1).

THE PEACE SETTLEMENT, 1918-23 1920-1
not hostile attitude in 1914-17 were still fresh. Events in Athens, coupled with the growing strength of the Turkish nationalists, led to Greek ambitions in Asia Minor now being regarded in London and Paris with a much less favourable eye than in the past. When a new allied conference met in London in November the French Prime Minister, Leygues, urged that Smyrna be given nothing more than local autonomy under Turkish sovereignty and made it clear that France would not ratify the treaty of Sévres as it stood. Meanwhile in eastern Anatolia the phantom-state of Armenia had collapsed with little resistance in October and November under the weight of combined attacks by the Bolsheviks and the Kemalists. On 2 December, by the treaty of Alexandropol, the latter recovered from it not merely the eastern provinces of Turkey but also the Kars and Ardahan areas lost in 1878. At the beginning of November the new Armenian Socialist Republic which had been created by the Bolsheviks confirmed this surrender. The joint attack on Armenia was only the most striking example of a tendency towards co-operation between Bolsheviks and Kemalists which was becoming increasingly marked. Ideologically the two movements had little in common, for the influence of Marxism on the illiterate and devoutly Muslim peasantry of Anatolia was negligible. They were united nevertheless, at least for the time being, by a common fear of the western powers, above all Great Britain, and by a common hostility to the treaty of Sévres. The Bolsheviks were deeply alarmed by its provision for free access to the Black Sea for the warships of all nations, since this seemed to expose their southern coastline to naval attack. The result was that semiofficial diplomatic relations were opened between Kemal and the Bolsheviks in May 1920 and that a Bolshevik representative was formally received at Ankara in November. Two months earlier the First Congress of Peoples of the East, which met at Baku on 1 September and was used by the Bolsheviks as a vehicle for antiBritish propaganda, had numbered 235 Turks among its membership of about 1900. Finally a Turco—Soviet treaty of 16 March 1921 saw unity between the Kemalists and the Bolsheviks at its highest point. It settled the Russo—Turkish frontier in the Caucasus after the collapse of the Georgian republic, giving Kars and Ardahan to Turkey and placing Batum under a Russo—Turkish condominium. More important, it provided for the drawing-up by the states with coastlines on the Black Sea of an international statute to regulate the regime of the Straits. This clause, if it could be put into practice,
would exclude from the Straits and the Black Sea the western
influence which both signatories so much disliked.
369


1921 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
The growing strength of the Turkish nationalists was clearly visible in the work of a new allied conference held in London in February-March 1921. It was attended by Bekir Sami Bey, the Foreign Minister of the Ankara government who also represented the Sultan and his ministers, and thus marked another step in the international acceptance of the nationalist regime. Moreover it saw the allies offer considerable modifications of the treaty of Sevres, which it was now clearly out of the question to enforce in full. In particular the position in the Smyrna area, it was proposed, might be altered considerably in favour of the Turks. Apart from the city itself, which would have a Greek garrison, the area might be policed by a gendarmerie controlled by the allies rather on the lines of that set up in Macedonia after 1903. The rejection of these suggestions by the nationalists showed that their self-confidence was growing. It was soon to grow still further. Both France and Italy were now anxious for a settlement which would allow them to reduce their armies of occupation in Cilicia and Adalia and unwilling to allow Britain to involve them in an anti-Turkish crusade. During the conference the French Prime Minister, Briand, and the Italian Foreign Secretary, Count Sforza, negotiated separate agreements with Bekir Sami. By these French and Italian forces were to evacuate most of the areas they held in Asia Minor in return for economic concessions by the Turks. This meant that the allies had openly abandoned any pretence of real co-operation. In the event the Assembly at Ankara, in which the ‘easterners’ who wished to rely for support mainly on the Bolsheviks were still strong, refused to ratify the agreements. Nevertheless in June the Italian government, whose domestic position was now extremely difficult, began to evacuate its forces without compensation of any kind. The collapse of Anglo-French co-operation in Asia Minor was completed when on 20 October, by the treaty of Ankara, France recognised, at least by implication, the nationalist government. She also agreed to hand over Cilicia to it. In return Syria, for which France had now become the mandatory power, was to receive the port of Alexandretta, while the nationalists promised to look favourably on French requests for the grant of mineral and other concessions. The treaty was in many ways unfavourable to France, particularly in its failure to give her the economic privileges and extraterritorial rights for which politicians in Paris had hoped. Its conclusion was by far the greatest diplomatic success yet won by the Turkish nationalists and drew vigorous though unsuccessful protests from Lord Curzon to the French government. The breakdown of their precarious unity drove the allies to
379


THE PEACE SETTLEMENT, 1918-23 1920-2 further concessions. In a conference in Paris in February and March 1922 they offered to restore to Turkish sovereignty the Smyrna area and the eastern shore of the Straits, as well as part of eastern Thrace. The Greek government accepted these terms. The Kemalists, however, demanded an immediate Greek evacuation of Anatolia, which was refused;and on this note the conference ended. The victory of Turkish nationalism was now about to culminate in the expulsion of the Greek forces from Asia Minor. The weakness of the Greek position there had already become evident. An offensive launched in October 1920 had aimed at capturing Eskishehr and Afiun—Karahissar and thus controlling the railway which ran from north to south across Anatolia. It had been checked in two battles at In6éni, in January and at the beginning of April 1921. Another offensive was halted in August in a long struggle on the river Sakkarya. Clearly the Greek army, whose communications with its base at Smyrna were long and poorly-organised, might have great difficulty in holding the territory it had overrun. Its position was further undermined by the success of Kemal in raising fresh forces during the winter of 1921-2 and by the French agreement with the nationalists of October 1921, which freed for action in western Anatolia the forces hitherto pinned down by the French garrisons in Cilicia, Thus strengthened the Turks launched a decisive attack on 26 August 1922. Under it the Greek army disintegrated entirely. Less than a fortnight later, its commander a prisoner, what was left of it reached Smyrna as a host of demoralised fugitives. The pursuing Turks entered the city a few days later and revenged themselves for the excesses which had sometimes marked the Greek occupation by the last of the massacres of subject peoples which had been the hallmark of their rule for the last century. With the defeat of the Greek army it remained only to expel the small allied forces still occupying Constantinople and the Straits area and thus complete the achievement of Turkish unity and independence. It seemed for a moment that this might be accomplished. The French government had already come to terms with Kemal by the treaty of October 1921; and that of Italy, now on the point of being overthrown by the Fascists, wished only to cut its losses in Turkey. Both withdrew their garrisons from the Straits on 19 September and left the British to face the Kemalists alone. For a few weeks Anglo-French relations reached a pitch of bitterness which was not again to be approached till 1940. Lloyd George remained as Turcophobe as ever ;but several members of his cabinet, notably Curzon, had long doubted the wisdom and even the practicability of his policies. Moreover his position was now danger
N2 371


1922 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
ously undermined by the restiveness of the Conservative supporters
of his coalition government. The cabinet issued to Sir Charles
Harington, the commander of the British forces in Turkey,
belligerent and uncompromising instructions which he tactfully
ignored in part. Thus though for a time a clash between British and
Turkish troops seemed inevitable it was avoided by an agreement on
armistice terms reached little more than an hour before the British
were to open fire on the Turks at Chanak.! By the armistice of
Mudanya of 11 October (to which the Greek government acceded
three days later) eastern Thrace and Adrianople were to be handed over to the Turkish nationalists, and Turkish sovereignty over Constantinople and the Straits, still in British hands, was recognised. The ‘Chanak crisis’ had thus led to a considerable though not quite complete victory for Kemal and his followers; and this victory was symbolised by the disappearance within the next few days of their most obvious enemies. On 19 October Lloyd George resigned. On 1 November the Assembly, under heavy pressure from Mustapha Kemal, abolished the Sultanate. On the 17th the Sultan fled to Malta on a British warship. This undignified exit did much to destroy any remaining popular loyalty to the House of Othman and to clear the way for the progressive republican regime symbolised by Kemal: with Mehmed VI there came to an end the line of Ottoman rulers which extended in unbroken male succession back to the thirteenth century. The international conference which met at Lausanne on 2t November 1922 to revise the treaty of Sevres had had its task, at least in some respects, simplified by events. There was now no question that Smyrna would remain Turkish. Nor was there any possibility of creating an independent Armenia.’ Two other territorial questions, those of the frontiers of eastern Thrace and of Mosul, gave a good deal of trouble; but the discussions at Lausanne centred largely around two non-territorial issues. These were the regime of the Straits and the Capitulations. The first of these was an issue between the Soviet government,
which was represented at the conference, and the western powers,
even more than between the Turks and their former enemies.

nations deeply alarmed Russia; and Chicherin, the Soviet Foreign Minister who led the Russian delegation, therefore stood forth as
the upholder of Turkish sovereignty in this respect. He urged that the Straits should be closed to all warships except those of Turkey. If they were internationalised they should be controlled only by the Black Sea states, to whom they were of vital importance. In fact Russia’s attitude was now the exact opposite of what it had been a century or more earlier. Then she had thought largely in terms of expansion, of access to the Mediterranean. Now she wished only to be left in peace, to be protected against possible attacks on her southern coast. Trotskii, still the leading figure after Lenin in the Russian government, put the Soviet case in a nutshell in a newspaper interview given early in November 1922. “The freedom of the Straits’, he contended, ‘is nothing but a military dictatorship of the Black Sea for the country possessing the biggest fleet’.1 This point of view did not prevail. Mustapha Kemal, his position secure, did not need Russian support as he had done two years before; and his victory of September—October 1922 led to an immediate increase in persecution of the tiny Turkish Communist Party. Moreover quite enough traditional anti-Russian feeling survived in Turkey to make the Turks unwilling to see themselves permanently face-to-face with Russia in the Black Sea, with the western powers to whom they had owed so much in the past locked out. Thus the draft Straits Convention of 1 February 1923, in spite of great efforts by Chicherin, was in general a victory for the western and above all the British point of view. It provided for the creation of demilitarised zones on both the Asian and European shores (though these were much smaller than had been proposed by the treaty of Sevres). The Turks were to have a garrison in Constantinople; and Britain, France, Italy and Japan jointly guaranteed freedom of navigation through the Straits and the security of the demilitarised zones. In return Turkey conceded a limited right of passage for foreign warships in time of peace, though none of these was to be of over 10,000 tons and no power was to send into the Black Sea naval forces stronger than those of the most powerful Black Sea state. An International Straits Commission was to be established at Constantinople. These terms were embodied in the Convention of 24 July, which was signed by all the powers
represented at the conference but was never ratified by the Soviet
government. The last British troops left Constantinople on 2
October.
The question of foreign influence and rights in Turkey proved
more difficult. The western powers, above all France, felt with some 1 J. Degras (ed.), Soviet Documents on Foreign Policy (Oxford, 1951-3), 1. 345+

reason that the Turks could not yet provide themselves with a really efficient administration or a really equitable judicial system. They therefore pressed strongly for safeguards for foreign property and nationals to be incorporated in the treaty. The Turkish delegation however, led by Ismet Inénii, one of the heroes of the struggle with Greece, refused to accept any revival of the hated Capitulations or any conditions which branded them as inferior. The opposition between these two points of view led to a temporary breakdown of the conference on 4 February 1923: it did not reassemble till 23 April. When it did, negotiations dragged on for a further three months. They ended in a victory for the Turkish point of view. The Capitulations were abolished; and though Turkey was not at once freed from all foreign economic control (she undertook, for example, not to raise her tariff-rates for some years above a certain level) she gained the substance of her claims. This was regarded in Paris as a defeat for France. Since her economic interests in Turkey were still much greater than those of any other power she lost correspondingly heavily by the ending of the Capitulations. She had helped to inflict a serious political defeat on Britain;but the latter had in fact lost hardly
374


THE PEACE SETTLEMENT, 1918-23 1923-6 anything of importance by the treaty. By contrast no state, with the exception of Greece, sacrificed more than France at Lausanne. The conference had thus, from the Turkish point of view, been a success. The internationalisation of the Straits was not entirely welcome in Ankara; but against this had to be placed the recovery of the whole of Anatolia, of Thrace as far as the river Maritza, and of the islands of Imbros and Tenedos. It was also provided that there should be a compulsory exchange of Greek and Turkish populations under foreign rule (though this was not to apply to the Greeks of Constantinople or the Turks of western Thrace) so that the Greek minority in western Asia Minor should not become once more a source of conflict. Alone of the states which surrendered in 1918 Turkey paid no reparations to her conquerors. One important Turco-British dispute still dragged on after the signature of the treaty — that over the vilayet of Mosul which had been occupied by British troops at the end of 1918, after the signature of the armistice of Mudros and in contravention of its terms. The population of the vilayet was largely Kurdish; and incorporation in the predominantly Arab state of Iraq, as envisaged by the British government, was far from popular with it. Nevertheless in December 1925 the Council of the League of Nations, to which the dispute had been referred, decided in favour of Britain; and though the decision aroused much bad feeling in Turkey an agreement of June 1926 recognised Mosul as part of the British-dominated kingdom of Iraq. The long story of the Turkish peace settlement had thus ended in an agreement reasonably satisfactory to all the parties concerned except the Greeks, the Russians and to some extent the French, The treaty of Lausanne had serious defects from the standpoint of many of the human beings it affected. It gave international approval to the expulsion from Turkey of hundreds of thousands of Greeks whose resettlement in Thrace and elsewhere created great problems for the poverty-stricken Greek government. It destroyed for ever hopes of Armenian independence or Kurdish autonomy. It displeased some of the more extreme Turkish nationalists by leaving Mosul as a de facto part of Iraq and Alexandretta as part of Syria. But it was given permanence and solidity by one overmastering virtue: it faced facts. It acknowledged that Ionia could never be Greek; that the Armenians were too few and too scattered to form the basis of a state; that the great powers were determined to place the Straits under international control. Above all it acknowledged that the Turkish state, now reduced to an Anatolian nucleus which was in the main

1918-20 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 ethnically Turkish, was no longer contracting, no longer the helpless victim of stronger and more efficient rivals. “The Treaty of Lausanne with its Annexes,’ wrote an observer in 1924, ‘seemed destined, in all human probability, to inaugurate a more lasting settlement, not only that the Treaty of Sévres, but than the Treaties of Versailles, St. Germain, Trianon and Neuilly.”! The generation which followed was to confirm this judgement.
The position in the Arab parts of the Ottoman Empire was extremely fluid and unstable when the war ended. For this there were at least three reasons. In the first place the inhabitants of the area, or at least the educated or semi-educated groups who led them, were now more nationalist than ever before and were putting forward unprecedented demands for independence and _ unity. Nationalism (as distinct from mere xenophobia) had not penetrated as yet very deeply in the Arab world; but it was growing rapidly and becoming increasingly vociferous. More and more the Arab nationalists were putting forward claims whose validity in terms of the prevalent doctrine of self-determination was hard to deny. ‘Generally speaking’, wrote Sir John de Robeck, the British High Commissioner in Constantinople, in December 1919, ‘there would appear to be in varying degrees throughout all the Moslem countries of the Near and Middle East a growing tendency to react against European domination and control.... The expression “ selfdetermination”’ has echoed throughout the Near East, and though perhaps naturally imperfectly understood, it yet forms the theme of every political scribbler and leader of public opinion’.? Secondly the victorious allies had during the war made a series of promises, express or implied, to one another, to the Arabs and to the Zionists. Some of these promises it was now impossible to keep: others were obviously conflicting and irreconcilable, in the spirit if not in the letter. Here was a fertile field for dispute as the hopeless struggle to reconcile wartime expedients with peacetime ideals developed. Finally the interests and ambitions of the powers conflicted even more sharply in Syria, Palestine and Mesopotamia than in the Balkans or Anatolia. There was resentment in Paris of the fact that the Arab areas, and especially Syria, a traditional sphere of French cultural and economic influence, had been conquered by forces supplied almost entirely by the British Empire.? This jealousy of

All these strands — nationalist ambitions, conflicting promises and rival imperialisms — were intertwined in the problem of Syria, the most dangerous and difficult of those which faced the peacemakers in the Arab countries. Syria had been the cradle of modern Arab nationalism. The desire for independence was far more powerful there than in any other part of the Arab world with the possible exception of Egypt. The Young Arab Party and the AAd, a military

1918-19 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
secret society of the kind which had been developing before 1914, were the real rulers of the country insofar as it was ruled at all in 1919-20. The charming and rather ineffective Emir Feisal, the son of the Sharif Husain, had proclaimed an independent Arab government for the whole of Syria at Damascus on 7 October 1918. He acted as the ostensible leader of the Syrians during this period but was always largely a figurehead which nationalist organisations manipulated for their own purposes. These organisations dominated the Syrian congress which in January 1919, apparently without consultation with the Emir, proclaimed him King of Syria. In their demand for independence they could draw on several important sources of support. They could appeal to the Anglo—French declaration of g November 1918,! which could be interpreted as a promise of freedom, as well as to the general idea of self-determination which Wilson had so effectively popularised as a panacea for all international ills. They also received a certain amount of sympathy from some British officials in the Near East and might hope to play off Britain against France in the peace settlement and benefit by their rivalries. Against this, however, was the fact that the Sykes—Picot agreement, which neither Britain nor France had formally denounced, undoubtedly promised the latter control, directly or in the form of a sphere of influence, in Syria. Also French public opinion, like that of Italy, was determined that a victory bought at such cost should yield some fruits in the form of territorial gains. The realisation that the spoils available were either almost worthless (like most of Germany’s former possessions in Africa and the Pacific) or so difficult to hold as to be in the end not worth having (like Asia Minor and many of the Arab areas) was as yet too painful to be acceptable. Moreover since they had already given way to Britain over Palestine and Mosul both government and public opinion in Paris were in no mood to make further concessions to anyone anywhere in the Near East. Thus when on 6 February 1919 Feisal, presenting the Arab case to the statesmen assembled in Paris, demanded independence for all the Arab areas from Alexandretta southwards (with the temporary exception of Palestine where he asked for ‘the effective superposition of a great trustee’ able to hold the balance between Jews and Arabs) his ideas proved quite unacceptable to France. Six weeks later, moreover, Lloyd George aroused deep suspicion and resentment in Paris by urging that Damascus, Hama, Homs and Aleppo should become part of an independent Arab state and that the French sphere of influence should be confined to the coastal areas of Syria. * See pp. 351-2. 378


THE PEACE SETTLEMENT, 1918-23 1919
Throughout the rest of the year Franco-Syrian and FrancoBritish relations grew steadily worse. In March, after Britain had formally declared that she would not accept a mandate for Syria, a group of British and French experts proposed that the French position there should be similar to that of the British in Egypt, and that the Lebanon and perhaps the Jebel Druse should receive autonomy under the rule of Feisal. This had no result. In April Feisal appears to have made a verbal promise to Clemenceau to use his influence in Syria in favour of the acceptance of a French mandate; but on his own admission he did not mean to keep his word, and he could not have done a great deal to help France even had he wished to. In July the Syrian Congress sharpened the conflict between the French and Arab points of view by refusing to recognise either the Sykes—Picot agreement or the Balfour Declaration and demanding an independent state ruled by Feisal covering the whole of Syria and Palestine. The report in July of an American commission (the King-Crane Commission) which had been sent by Wilson to investigate the wishes of the Near Eastern peoples with regard to the allocation of mandates over them, made it clear that the granting of one to France would be bitterly unpopular in Syria. However it had no real effect on the situation, for by the time it was presented the United States was already withdrawing into isolation and washing her hands of the world’s problems. The position was complicated by the fact that British troops were still in occupation of Syria and Cilicia. They were withdrawn after an agreement with France of 13 September 1919; but French troops were to replace them only in the coastal areas of Syria. Damascus, Hama, Homs, Aleppo and the vast undeveloped area to the east of these cities were to be under an Arab government, though this was to be supported and advised by France. The sympathy with the Arab point of view which these conditions revealed aroused in France the deepest suspicions of Britain’s motives. The violence with which she was denounced in the French press created alarm in London, while Clemenceau increasingly insisted that the Syrian question must be settled in direct negotiations with Feisal from which the British government would be excluded. On 14 October, in a note which Lord Curzon, who had succeeded Balfour as Foreign Secretary, described as ‘almost insolent’, he refused to send General Gouraud, who had just been appointed as French High Commissioner in Syria, to take part in the discussions which were then going on in London between the Emir and the British ministers. He also opposed Feisal’s proposal that an American delegate should take
part in them. Meanwhile fears were growing that the Syrian
379


1919-20 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
nationalists might be driven into some form of co-operation with the
Kemalists in Turkey. ‘It is safe to say’, reported the British political officer at Damascus in October, ‘that the majority of Moslems in the Aleppo vilayet, and a very large number in the vilayet of Damascus, are in sympathy with Turkish aspirations, and would prefer union with Turkey to being under an unpopular European power.’? Early in November Feisal referred the whole question to the Allied Supreme Council in Paris. He was now, however, more and more aware of the difficulties of his position and of the unwillingness of Great Britain and the United States to give him effective help against France. He thus allowed himself to be driven into a policyof compromise and of increasing concessions to French demands. At the end of November he agreed with Clemenceau that France should be allowed to occupy the Lebanon and the coastal areas of Syria as far north as Alexandretta. Though he rejected a month later proposals for what amounted to a French protectorate over the whole country, he agreed in the following month that the new Syrian state should draw its advisers and technical experts from France alone. This weak-kneed policy, as it seemed to them, was highly distasteful to the Syrian nationalists and did much to deprive Feisal of what authority he still retained. From the end of 1919 onwards armed attacks on French troops and Arab Christians became steadily more numerous. There was also a disturbing tendency for nationalist sympathy with the Kemalists to take the form of open alliance. In the first days of 1920 two Syrian notables negotiated in Constantinople with a committee representing Mustapha Kemal an agreement for joint action against the western powers. Nothing came of this; but the situation had clearly ugly possibilities from the British and French point of view. It was now clear that a large-scale clash between French and Syrians would be hard to avoid. Early in March 1920 the Syrian Congress, meeting in Damascus, elected Feisal king of Syria and proclaimed the country’s complete independence. This was a disastrous mistake. The proclamation did much to alienate Feisal’s friends and supporters in Europe. It also alarmed the Maronites of the Lebanon, who saw themselves threatened with domination by predominantly Moslem nationalists, and thus led to a proclamation of Lebanese independence on 22 March. In the following month the San Remo conference strengthened France’s position by giving her a mandate for the whole of Syria: a crop of violent demonstrations in Damascus and other Syrian towns was the immediate result. By the middle of June an explosion was imminent. On the 14th

THE PEACE SETTLEMENT, 1918-23 1918-26
Gouraud presented to Feisal an ultimatum demanding acceptance
of the French mandate and a number of other concessions. The newly-proclaimed king realised that his army was quite unable to resist the French and was in favour of surrender; but the Syrian Congress, backed by much popular feeling, demanded resistance. Moreover although the Syrian government agreed to Gouraud’s condition on the 2oth it was clear that the French commander, who had now set his forces in motion, had no intention of halting his advance. On the 25th he occupied Damascus. Even after his capital had fallen and his cause was clearly hopeless Feisal seems to have thought of trying to negotiate with the French; but by the end of the month he had been forced to take refuge in Palestine. Syria was still very inadequately pacified, however. There was little support for French rule except in the Lebanon with its large Christian population and long tradition of Catholic missionary influence. In 1926 a considerable revolt of the Druse tribesmen led to the temporary expulsion of the French garrison from Damascus. It is important, in view of its later growth to one of the greatest and most intractable of international issues, to realise that in 1918-20 the Palestine problem seemed to almost everyone less significant than that of Syria. Palestine was much smaller and poorer than its neighbour. Its people were less well educated and therefore less nationalistic. It was clear that they were bitterly opposed to the large-scale Jewish settlement envisaged by the Balfour Declaration; but this did not seem of great importance. There was never any question of Britain abandoning or even modifying the policy of a Jewish National Home, especially as the American and French governments had now promised their support for it. It should be impressed on the Arabs, wrote Curzon, by no means one of the British statesmen most favourable to Zionism, ‘that the matter is a chose jugée and continued agitation would be useless and detrimental’.1 It was realised, at least by the more intellectually honest British statesmen, that their country had entangled herself in a network of conflicting obligations from which it was now impossible to escape with honour, that the promises to the Sharif Husain of 1915-16 and the Anglo-French declaration of November 1918 could not be reconciled easily, or perhaps at all, with the Sykes—Picot agreement and the Balfour Declaration. ‘So far as Palestine is concerned’, wrote Balfour in August 1919 with some exaggeration, ‘the Powers have made no statement of fact which is not admittedly wrong, and no declaration of policy which, at least in the letter, they have not always intended to violate’.* Yet these moral dilemmas 1 B.D.F.P. ist series, iv. 329. 2 Ibid.

seemed to many of the statesmen concerned unimportant compared to the possibility of ending the dispersal and homelessness of the Jews. ‘Zionism’, remarked Balfour in the same memorandum, ‘be it right or wrong, good or bad, is rooted in agelong traditions, in present needs, in future hopes, of far profounder import than the desires and prejudices of the 700,000 Arabs who now inhabit that ancient land.’ Few of his colleagues would have accepted the implication that Zionist claims were above ordinary considerations of legality and even morality; but almost all would have agreed that they should carry more weight than the demands of the existing inhabitants of Palestine. Moreover might not the Arabs benefit from an influx of Jewish capital and skill as the inhabitants of Africa, or some of them, had from European investment and techniques? Events seemed for a time to give some support to such ideas. The Sharif Husain, or King Husain of the Hedjaz as he had now become, was still the leading representative of Arab nationalism: he had shown no particular alarm when the terms of the Balfour Declaration were revealed to him. In January 1919 the Emir Feisal made with Weizmann an agreement by which he undertook to co-operate in carrying out the Declaration and to assist Jewish immigration to Palestine. (Though in a postscript he made the execution of this promise conditional on the satisfaction of the Arab claims he had already laid before the Peace Conference.) Weizmann on his side showed himself remarkably moderate. When he presented the Zionist case to the conference on 27 February he asked for no more than ‘an administration not necessarily Jewish, which would render it possible to send into Palestine 70,000 to 80,000 Jews annually’. But it soon became clear that there was no hope of any real co-operation between Arabs and Jews. The King-Crane Commission told Wilson on 20 June, from Jerusalem, that both Moslems and Christians in Palestine were taking up ‘a most hostile attitude’ to Jewish immigration and that the dreams of the Zionists could be realised only by force of arms.1 A British officer in Palestine reported on 12 August that ‘Dr. Weizmann’s agreement with the Emir Feisal is not worth the paper it is written on or. the energy wasted in the conversation to make it’;? and the Syrian Congress repudiated it in spite of the fact that the Zionists had shown themselves distinctly favourable to Feisal’s claims in Syria. By April 1920, when the San Remo conference awarded the mandate to Britain, Palestine was settling down to that tension punctuated by massacre which was to

1918-22 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 be her lot for the next generation. The first serious anti-Jewish riots
broke out in May 1921. In Mesopotamia also Great Britain was faced by severe difficulties. The area was backward, though perhaps potentially more wealthy than any other part of the Arab world. Its communications and level of education were poor. It was divided by tribal rivalries, by the existence of minority groups such as the Kurds and Assyrians, and by conflicts between the schismatic Shia form of Islam, to which most of its population belonged, and the more orthodox Sunni form. Nationalism, though less developed than in Syria, was beginning to be influential. The Sharifian family, headed by King Husain, hoped to bring Mesopotamia as well as Syria and the Hedjaz under its rule; and in the later months of 1919 there was a considerable movement in favour of some form of Syrian—Mesopotamian union. The fact that arrangements for the assumption of the mandate by Britain were not complete till May 1920 and that the peace treaty with Turkey was so long delayed gave time for a desire for independence to develop. In August 1920 it burst forth in the form of a serious rising, largely tribal in character. This was suppressed, with some difficulty; but even in the following year Britain was maintaining in the country, at great expense, a garrison of about 100,000 men (against the 16,000 needed by the Turks before 1914). However by the end of 1921 the position had become a good deal more stable. Mesopotamia had by then become the kingdom of Iraq; and the Emir Feisal, dispossessed in Syria, had been established as its first king in the face of strong French protests. (He was installed at the end of August after winning a rather unconvincing victory in a referendum held to decide the wishes of the population.) As a Sunni in a predominantly Shia country he encountered considerable opposition. Nevertheless British officials were now laying the foundations of a reasonably efficient administration, the oil-wells of Mosul and Kirkuk were beginning to be productive, and the country had been forcibly jolted out of the stagnation which had so long afflicted it. By a treaty of 10 October 1922 Britain promised to give armed support if necessary to the new state, while in matters of finance and international affairs the advice of a British High Commissioner was to be binding on the government. British domination, however, though more acceptable than the French regime in Syria, never became genuinely popular. The concessions to Iraqi feeling made by successive British governments always lagged far behind the increasing demands of the local radicals and could be made to appear signs of weakness rather than of goodwill. Injured pride and frustrated ambitions had been to some extent

assuaged or driven underground in the 1g20s: they had not been weakened, far less destroyed. The war did much to intensify the nationalist (and hence inevitably anti-British) feeling which already existed in Egypt. The proclamation of a British protectorate over the country in December 1914 had stimulated nationalist resentments and hopes of future independence. The Anglo-French declaration of 9gNovember 1918 raised these feelings to a still higher pitch, while the economic dislocation caused by the war did much to increase hostility to British rule. By 1918 the Wafd party, which was for long to be synonymous with Egyptian nationalism, was coming into existence under the leadership of Zaghlul Pasha. His arrest by the British in March of the following year unleashed widespread disorder which had to be crushed by the use of troops on a considerable scale. Moreover his release after a short internment in Malta gave to many Egyptians an unjustified impression of British weakness. The appointment of General Allenby as High Commissioner led to some improvement in the situation; but Egyptian tempers were now running very high and the position remained unstable throughout 1919. A mission headed by Lord Milner, the Colonial Secretary, arrived in Cairo in December with the task of working out a new constitution; but it had already been made clear in a statement issued by Allenby that it was intended to preserve British suzerainty in some form. The result was that the mission was boycotted by the nationalists. After it had left Egypt in March 1920 Zaghlul, who was then in Paris, himself opened negotiations with Milner. These dragged on till November without result; but during them Milner agreed to recognition of Egypt as an independent and sovereign state, a concession of fundamental importance which no British government henceforth attempted to withdraw. In February 1921 it was made clear that abolition of the protectorate would be accepted in London as the basis of a settlement; but renewed negotiations between Curzon and an Egyptian delegation headed by Adly Pasha, Zaghlul’s most important rival, broke down in November. This was followed by Adly’s resignation and a second arrest and deportation of Zaghlul. This in its turn was inevitably followed by renewed terrorism. Finally on 28 February 1922, on the initiative of Allenby, the British government issued a declaration ending the protectorate and making Egypt an independent sovereign
state. This however reserved to Britain, at least for the time being,
the protection of imperial communications through Egypt, of Egypt
herself against foreign aggression, and of foreign interests and
minorities in the country. Even more important, the Sudan was
385


1922-5 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 excluded from its scope and remained, at least in theory, an Anglo
Egyptian condominium.
The self-government which had been placed in the hands of the
Egyptian people was thus severely limited. It was essentially a
compromise with the British arranged by the great Egyptian landowners, who were frightened by Zaghlul’s extremism and jealous of his personal power. As a result the Wafd denounced the declaration and attacks on British soldiers and officials continued, while the situation was further confused by the efforts of the Khedive, who on 15 March was proclaimed King Fuad I, to recover some of the personal authority wielded by his predecessors before 1914. Zaghlul was released once more at the end of March; and in November 1923 the Wafd, under his leadership, won a huge majority in the elections for the Chamber of Deputies. He remained, however, quite uncompromising in his opposition to the four ‘reserved points’ mentioned in the declaration of 22 February, particularly to that relating to the Sudan. Negotiations in London in September and October 1924 between him and the new Labour Prime Minister, Ramsay MacDonald, therefore collapsed almost at once; and his return to Egypt was followed on 19 November by the murder in Cairo of the Governor-General of the Sudan, Sir Lee Stack. Allenby, furiously indignant, presented to Zaghlul an ultimatum demanding an apology by the Egyptian government, the payment of a large fine, and the immediate withdrawal of all Egyptian officers from the Sudan, as well as a number of other concessions. This led to the resignation of Zaghlul; but it was now becoming clear that if Egypt were not governed by the Wa/fd it must be ruled autocratically by the king and his personal advisers. When Allenby gave up the High Commissionership in June 1925 and returned to England, the acute crisis of the post-war years was over. But Egypt’s difficulties and frustrations were far from being at an end, Independence, in spite of the promulgation of a relatively liberal constitution in 1923, seemed to many of her people a mockery while a large force of British troops remained in the country. The Sudan was further beyond her reach than ever. Her leaders, with few exceptions, were intriguing, irresponsible and often corrupt. Above all the antagonism between the monarchy and the Wa/fd, which British rule had done a good deal to stimulate, was becoming more and more acute. Until the revolution of 1952 this antagonism remained the main, almost the only real, issue in Egyptian domestic politics. But for it the collapse of what was left of British power in Egypt would have come much sooner, While it lasted far too high a proportion of the country’s political energies was channelled into

THE PEACE SETTLEMENT, 1918-23 1920s—30s
party intrigues and nationalist demonstrations and away from the more humdrum tasks of improving her administration and economic life. Egypt, unlike Turkey, thus found no solution for any of her fundamental problems in the years of change in the Near East which followed the First World War.

Conclusion
Wiru the Lausanne settlement the Eastern Question was no more. It had originated during the eighteenth century in the crumbling of the once-great Ottoman Empire and in the ambitions and rivalries this aroused among the powers. Throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries the empire continued to decline and the powers to quarrel, while the position was complicated and envenomed by the emergence of greedy and clamorous national states in the Balkans and the threat of their appearance in the Arab areas under Turkish rule. By 1923 the position had totally altered. The disappearance of the Habsburg Empire, the destruction of German influence, the weakening of Russia and the relatively small amount of attention paid to the Near East by the new regime there, had made the rivalries of the great powers more limited and innocuous than at any time for the last century and a half. The Balkan frontiers drawn after 1918 were in general as fair as was practicable and the events of the interwar period! tended to consolidate them. Unsatisfied territorial claims continued to be cherished by nearly all the Balkan states by Bulgaria to western Thrace and parts of Macedonia, by Greece to southern Albania, by Yugoslavia to Fiume — but these no longer threatened to involve the great powers and destroy the peace of Europe as they had sometimes done in the past. The incompletely developed nationalism of the Arab countries was as yet of secondary importance in international affairs; and its models and analogies lay in Asia rather than in Europe. National feeling in Egypt, by far the most advanced of the major Arab states, or pseudo-states, owed much more to the Russo—Japanese war and to the gratifying spectacle it offered of a great European power defeated by an Asian state than to the successes of nationalism in Italy or the Balkans. Above all after 1923 the contraction of Turkish power which had gone on for so many generations — slow, sometimes temporarily halted, ultimately irresistible — was at an end. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s the building of a drab but reasonably efficient

republic able to show promise of becoming a modern state went on.! Kemal and his associates, preoccupied by vast internal problems, pursued a consistently cautious and conservative foreign policy. After 1926, with the settlement of the Mosul question, they were slowly reconciled with Britain. In 1930 a treaty with Greece settled a number of outstanding questions between the two states. In 1934 Turkey joined Yugoslavia, Greece and Rumania in the Balkan Pact by which the signatories guaranteed each other’s independence and territorial integrity. In 1936 the Montreaux Convention abolished the Straits Commission set up in 1923 and gave Turkey once more the right to fortify the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles — an international vote of confidence in the Kemalist regime and its sense of responsibility. From 1939 onwards the Turkish government balanced with some skill between Germany and her enemies;? and Russian demands for the revision of the Montreux Convention, first put forward in June 1943 and broadened in August 1946 to include joint Russo—Turkish defence of the Straits, had no result. Until the First World War the Ottoman Empire had, by its very existence, been a factor making for instability, a dangerous nuisance in the affairs of Europe and the world. Its residuary legatee, the Turkish republic, was during the first two decades of its life by far the most stable political unit in the Near East. This contrast more than anything else underlines the fact that 1923 was the end of an epoch in Near Eastern affairs. At least from the 1830s onwards the powers chiefly concerned in Near Eastern affairs were Britain and Russia. To them alone the Near East seemed of first-class importance throughout most of the nineteenth century. They alone were consistently active there during the last hundred years of the Eastern Question. The Habsburg Empire was always interested, willy-nilly, in the affairs of the Danubian Principalities and the western Balkans. But its policies there were remarkably negative during the first half of the nineteenth century; and it was only the great defeats it suffered in Italy and Germany in 1859-66 which made it an active Balkan power. France, with a longer tradition of interest in Egypt, Syria and Asia Minor than any other European state, found from the 1870s onwards and to some extent even under Napoleon III that the weakening of her European position made it impossible for her to play a leading

political role in the Near East, in spite of her continuing economic importance there. Prussia, and the German Empire which she dominated after 1871, showed little sustained interest in the Balkans or the Ottoman Empire until late in the nineteenth century; and German activity in the Near East had always about it something forced and artificial. The fate of the area was never a German interest in the way that the retention of Alsace—Lorraine, the continued partition of Poland or the preservation of the Habsburg Empire were. Yet was not British and Russian interest in the Near East and their resulting antagonism there, at least during the half-century from the 1830s to the 1880s, also greater than the facts really warranted? Clearly Britain’s direct economic stake in the area, in the form of trade and investment, was slight as compared with those she was simultaneously building up in the United States, Latin America, India or Australia. Moreover the growth of Russian power in the Near East scarcely threatened Britain’s fundamental interests, at least while her naval power remained intact, just as the French invasion of Egypt and Napoleon I’s Near Eastern ambitions had never been a real danger to Britain while she retained command of the sea. Certainly Russian expansion in the Near East was more lasting and more varied in its forms than that of France. The appeal which Russia could make to the Orthodox of the Balkans and Asia Minor was more powerful and politically far more important than any French call on the sympathies of the relatively insignificant Catholic minorities of the area. Above all Russia, unlike France, had land frontiers with the Ottoman Empire, in Asia as well as in Europe. Yet were Russian ambitions in the Near East during most of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries really much more of a threat to vital British interests than those of France had been under the Directory and Napoleon I? By expanding in the Caucasus Russia could and did increase her influence in Persia. But Britain was always able to avert any danger of the country falling totally under Russian dominance either by direct military pressure of her own (as in 1838, when an expedition was sent to the Persian Gulf for this purpose) or by using Russia’s European preoccupations to force her to limit her Persian ambitions (as in the negotiation of the Anglo—Russian entente of 1907). In any case it was the Persian Gulf rather than Persia herself which was the vital British interest; and it was only in exceptional circumstances that Russian statesmen thought in terms of military penetration as far as the Gulf,) where

CONCLUSION Britain’s position was from the 1830s increasingly buttressed by a series of agreements with the petty Arab sheikhdoms along its southern shores. Russian influence in Persia never became the indirect threat to British power in India into which publicists from the end of the 1820s had feared it might develop. Again the expansion of Russian territory and influence in the Balkans, which created so many problems for Russia and aroused against her so much antagonism, affected Britain directly only insofar as it brought Russian power nearer to the Straits and increased Russia’s chances of passing her warships freely through them and even of gaining control of them. Would the free movement of Russian men-of-war through the Straits have threatened seriously any fundamental British interest ?The absence of any hostile reaction in London to the Russo—Turkish treaties of 1799 and 1805 suggests that until well into the nineteenth century no British government believed that it would. Moreover the ineffectiveness of the Russian navy against serious opponents does not suggest that it would have been a great threat to British naval power in the Mediterranean even had it enjoyed complete freedom of movement through the Straits. In any case Russian policy there, certainly from the 1850s onwards and perhaps even from the end of the 1820s, was far more defensive than was realised in Britain. It was rarely that any responsible Russian statesman seriously envisaged Russia acquiring physical control of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles; even the demands put forward in the negotiations of March-April 1915 with Britain and France were really a response to the initiative of the western powers.” More and more, as the weakness and difficulties of the Tsarist empire became apparent, Russian policy was dominated by the desire to exclude the fleets of the other great powers from the Black Sea. Insofar as the idea of a seizure of the Straits remained important it was for this essentially defensive reason; the attitude of Chicherin at Lausanne was the logical culmination of a change in Russian attitudes which had been in progress for many decades. British fears of Russia in the Near East then were always exaggerated, even unreal; and it should be remembered that until the 1850s anti-Russian feeling in Britain was based on resentment of the oppression of Poland and fear of Russian influence in Europe generally rather than on Near Eastern considerations. Until after the Crimean War Russian expansion in the Near East seemed dangerous to Britain mainly because it would increase Russian power in

THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 Europe as a whole, and thus threaten the balance of power there and weaken the forces of liberty and constitutional government. That war destroyed the conservative concert with the Habsburg Empire which Nicholas I had struggled so hard to maintain. The great changes in the political configuration of Europe which took place between 1859 and 1871 ended the possibility, which had seemed so menacing during the four decades after 1815, of Russian dominance of the continent. The Anglo—Russian antagonism which assumed such dangerous proportions in the 1870s was thus more exclusively focussed on the Near East than any previous conflict of the kind; and it is difficult to feel that the anti-Russian emotionalism of 1877-8 in Britain was justified by the real significance of the issues involved. On the Russian side also the attention devoted to the Near East was, at least at times, excessive and unrealistic. Russia’s position, however, was complicated by the fact that she was interested in the area on several different levels. She had a strategic interest which has already been mentioned, centred on the Straits and increasingly on the need to protect the southern shores of Russia from attack. She had an economic interest, again centred mainly on the Straits and on the desire to ensure the free movement of Russian trade through them. As the grain exports of Odessa, the heavy industry of the Donbas and the oil production of the Caucasus in turn grew in importance and Russia’s economic centre of gravity moved slowly to the south, the need for secure commercial egress to the Mediterranean became steadily more pressing. And underlying Russian policy during the whole of the period covered by this book there was the powerful emotional urge to protect the Orthodox peoples under Moslem bondage, to recover for Orthodoxy its former capital, Constantinople, and thus to assert in face of the wealthy, sophisticated but ultimately inferior west the power of Holy Russia. Moreover Russian influence in the Near East worked in different ways and through more than one channel, at least from the 1850s onwards. On the one hand there was the policy of the Russian government, formal, normally European in outlook, carried on through professional diplomats. On the other stood that of unofficial Russia, expressing itself through Panslav societies and newspapers or, in a different way, through the influence of Russian populists and socialists whose doctrines found an appreciable audience in some parts of the Balkans. From the end of the Crimean War until the revolution of 1917 it was these writers and political sectaries, at least as much as the diplomats and soldiers, who formed the image of Russia for the Balkan peoples. Russian policy in the Near East was
392


CONCLUSION 19th-early 20th Centuries
thus more complex, more influenced by conflicting cross-currents, than that of any other power. The real interests which Russia had at stake in the Near East and the real possibilities open to her there did not, at least from the mid-nineteenth century onwards, justify the depth of her involvement in the area and the intensity of her emotional attachment to it. After 1841 the regime of the Straits gave her considerable if not absolute security against attack in the Black Sea in wars in which Turkey was not a belligerent. Free movement for her warships through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles, still more physical control of them, would certainly have been a strategic advantage to her. But it is doubtful whether either, had it been achieved, would have been worth the hostility and suspicion which her allegedly aggressive intentions at the Straits continually aroused in western Europe and above all in Britain. Any real improvement in her strategic position in the Near East and in her ability to defend her southern coastline depended largely on the strengthening of her Black Sea fleet, an objective which attracted only intermittent and inadequate attention in St. Petersburg. Moreover there is no evidence that the growth of her trade through the Straits was hindered by the fact that she did not have physical control of them, any more than that of her commerce through the Baltic was impeded by the fact that the Sound was in non-Russian hands. Even Russia’s attitude to the Balkans and their peoples was irrational in the sense that all her victories there brought her no adequate return in territory or lasting influence. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries she was exploited, and allowed herself to be exploited, by the nations which were struggling into existence in the peninsula. To the independence of every Balkan state except Albania she made a major contribution; the autonomy of Bulgaria after 1878 was almost entirely her creation. Yet for all this she received a most inadequate reward in terms of political support. To some extent, above all in Rumania, this was the result of her own clumsiness, her overbearing policies and territorial greed; and over much of the Balkans popular friendship and respect for her remained strong after independence had been attained. In 1904, for example, prayers were offered in all Serb churches for her victory in the war with Japan. But in the nature of things the new Balkan governments were bound to follow their own interests. Gratitude
can never be a lasting force in international affairs; and from this unpleasant fact Russia suffered more than any other major state in the nineteenth century. Moreover her activity and influence in the
Balkans were certain to involve the resentment and suspicion of the
393


THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
other great powers and finally drew her into the disastrous rivalry
with Austria-Hungary which laid so much of the foundations of the
First World War. Nor did her economic weakness allow her to
compete in the Balkans with her rivals in what became, in the later nineteenth century, increasingly important means of influencing the politics of the area — railway-building, loans to governments and the supply of armaments. From the middle of the century and probably earlier her main opportunities of lasting expansion lay in Asia — in Turkestan, in the Far East and perhaps in Persia. This began to be clear with the great and rapid territorial gains which she made in eastern Siberia in 1858 and 1860 at the expense of China, and still more with those achieved in central Asia in the 1860s and 1870s. By the end of the century, with her dominance of Manchuria apparently established, it had become completely obvious to Witte and his followers. The revived interest in the Near East which followed the disastrous war of 1904-5 with Japan is easily understood; checked in Manchuria and Korea her expansive energies swung temporarily back to the Balkans and the Straits. But it was none the less a victory for tradition over realities.1 By 1829 Russia had made all the gains she really needed and to which she could reasonably aspire in the Balkans. In the Caucasus a similar position had been reached by the 1860s. In both areas the efforts of future generations failed to achieve any permanent improvement on what Russia had by then accomplished. The interest taken in the Near East by the great powers had in many ways unhappy results for its inhabitants. There were two obvious attitudes which the European states could take to the future of the Ottoman Empire. They might attempt to reform and modernise it while as far as possible preserving its political and territorial unity. They might, on the other hand, allow or encourage it to dissolve into a group of new national states, perhaps gaining some territory for themselves in the process. The first of these policies was pursued with remarkable consistency by Britain during the halfcentury from the 1830s onwards. But it involved a fundamental and ultimately insoluble dilemma. The reforms to be carried out by the Sultan and his ministers might be rooted in the history and traditions of the empire and in some sense hark back to the great age of Ottoman government in the fifteenth and first half of the sixteenth centuries. It was in this way that all changes, except those relating to the army, were envisaged in the eighteenth century.? Alterna

CONCLUSION tively, if they were to be distinctively European and to make the empire a European state they might be carried out by the powers themselves or under their supervision. Each of these possibilities had its own merits. The first, while slowing up the development of the empire in many ways, would have avoided a forcible break with the past and the importation wholesale from the west of foreign and half-understood ideas of justice, administration and fiscal organisation. It would have involved in particular retaining and adapting the old communal and millet system which had evolved over a long period in response to Ottoman conditions and which, with all its faults, had in the past done much to protect the individual against oppressive or rapacious rulers and officials. Ottoman institutions, if they could be made to work properly and enabled to use modern methods of communication and accounting, might provide at least as good an answer to the empire’s problems as European liberalism and nationalism. On the other hand reforms of a western kind imposed by the European powers, as envisaged by Stratford Canning and applied by Cromer in Egypt, also had advantages. They would inevitably arouse much resentment among those affected by them. But they might also give the empire the benefits of drastic modernisation of the kind partially achieved in India by a series of great reforming officials in the middle decades of the nineteenth century. In practice, however, neither gradual change based on Ottoman tradition nor drastic externally-imposed reforms could be achieved. By the later eighteenth century the traditions and ideas upon which Ottoman government rested were decayed and enfeebled. During the century and a half which followed they were undermined still further by the influence and example of a Europe which did not understand them and which, often unjustly, despised them. From the reign of Mahmud II onwards progress came to mean the adoption of European methods and increasingly of European ideas. Necessary change was thus imposed on the empire from outside, by foreign pressure and above all by the imperative need to increase Turkish military strength. An administrative and legal framework which, with all its glaring weaknesses, was at least a native product, was irretrievably destroyed. Railways, telegraphs and a modern army meant that the central government, though it could not effectively defend the empire against foreign attack, could tyrannise with unprecedented completeness over its subjects. Under Abdul Hamid and the Young Turks individuals and minority groups had less protection against oppression by their rulers than in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.

THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 This combination of weakness and oppressiveness in the Turkish
government might have been avoided if really thorough-going
reform had been carried out directly by the powers. But this was impossible except where European material interests were directly concerned — most notably in the foreign-controlled administration of the Ottoman Debt developed from 1881 onwards. Except in a few instances of this kind the rivalries of the powers and their wish to avoid direct responsibility for the intractable internal problems of the empire prevented concerted action. When a single power proposed drastic European-controlled reforms, as Britain did in regard to Asia Minor after 1878, it received no support from the others, its rivals or potential rivals. The result was that the Ottoman Empire gained the worst of all possible worlds. In it the process of reform was a continuous and unhappy compromise. The Turks were forced, partly by circumstances, partly by European and particularly British nagging, to carry out changes in which only an educated minority of them believed. This minority grew as the nineteenth century progressed; it was larger in the 1850s and very much larger in the 1870s than it had been in the 1830s. Yet its efforts were unsuccessful. In spite of the exertions of Mahmud II, of Reschid Pasha, of Ali, Fuad and Midhat Pashas and on the technical and administrative level of Abdul Hamid himself, the gulf between Turkey and western Europe in productive power, in military strength and governmental efficiency, was at least as wide in 1908 as it had been in 1774. Adequate reform of the Ottoman Empire and its maintenance within its existing frontiers were thus impossible. In the event, the alternative of dissolving the empire into a group of new national states triumphed and was perhaps bound to triumph. Yet it was a painful process which inevitably encountered its own difficulties. Parts of the Balkans — Macedonia, the Dobrudja, the Banatwere so mixed in their linguistic and ethnic composition that their fate was bound to give rise to violent conflicts between rival national groups. The western statesmen on whose decisions the drawing of Balkan frontiers often so much depended nearly always lacked, often through no fault of their own, the information on which to base just and rational decisions. Sir Henry Elliot complained that at the Constantinople Conference of 1876-7 ‘the new boundaries to be affixed to Vilayets, Sandjaks, Muderliks, or Nahiés, and the attributions to be assigned to Caimakams and Mutessarifs, were to be decided by a set of diplomatists of whom hardly one had even heard these names a week before, and who were profoundly ignorant of the distribution of the various races and creeds in the province (i.e.

The student of the Eastern Question can scarcely avoid an impression of sterility when he considers many aspects of it. For decades it bulked large in international affairs. Yet much of the diplomatic activity it provoked, and of the political and emotional energy devoted to it, was squandered. The powers strove to neutralise each other’s influence. They succeeded in creating in the Near East a workable balance between themselves and in delaying the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. More than this they could not accomplish. From the later eighteenth century onwards the area was integrated more and more firmly into the European state-system. No power was allowed to dominate it and therefore none, with the important exception of Britain in Egypt, was able to achieve there much that was truly constructive. The British in India, the Russians in central Asia, had a free hand. In both areas great administrative and economic achievements resulted. Over most of the Near East the mutual suspicions of the powers made such achievements impossible. Britain, Russia, France and at least in the later nineteenth century Austria-Hungary had all genuine Near Eastern interests. But in every case these tended to become distorted and magnified in the thinking of governments and the emotions of peoples by international rivalries and inherited traditions. Because the Near East was often the scene of great international tension it was easy to exaggerate its real importance. Russia could take pride in the aid she had given to the cause of freedom for the Balkan nationalities, 1 Some Revolutions and other Diplomatic Experiences (London, 1922), p. 280.

THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923 Britain in her sincere though limited efforts at reform in the Ottoman Empire and in her constructive work in Egypt. But their rivalries, and those of the other great powers of Europe, made the fate of the Near East for a century or more the most permanent of all sources of international conflict and the most intractable of all European political problems. And these rivalries were too often fruitless and too often irrelevant to the real interests of the states concerned.

Bibliography
Tuis selective and incomplete list is limited to secondary works, books and articles in the major European languages. It does not include memoirs, travellers’ accounts of the Near East or (with one exception) printed documents, though all of these are clearly very relevant to the subject. It tends to be weighted somewhat in favour of recent works, particularly of periodical articles which are more likely than books to escape the notice of students. Since it is intended primarily for English-speaking readers it may also give too much prominence to works in English.
GENERAL WORKS
L. S. Stavrianos, The Balkans since 1453 (New York, 1958), is a large and excellent textbook with an outstandingly complete bibliography, certainly the best general book on the history of the area. It deals with the internal development of the Balkan states as well as with diplomacy and is fullest on the twentieth century. W. Yale, The Near East, a Modern History (Ann Arbor, 1959), is a rather disappointing book which concentrates heavily on the history of the last fifty years. W. Miller, The Ottoman Empire and its Successors, 1801-1927, 4th ed. (Cambridge, 1936), is still useful as a source of information, mainly on the internal history of the Balkan states. On the Eastern Question proper J. Ancel, Manuel historique de la question d’Orient, 1792-1923 (Paris, 1923), is a useful compendium of facts, though now in many ways outdated. J. A. R. Marriott, The Eastern Question: An Historical Study in European Diplomacy, 4th ed. (Oxford, 1940), has for long held the field as the only general work in English; but it was first published in 1917 and is now out of date. I have not had access to a copy of F. Cognasso, Storia della questione d’Oriente (Turin, 1949). J. C. Hurewitz, Diplomacy in the Near and Middle East: a Documentary Record (Princeton, 1956), conveniently assembles in two volumes the major treaties and other diplomatic documents relating to the subject. On the Straits question the most useful general studies are still C. Phillipson and N. Buxton, The Question of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles (London, 1917), and N. Dascovici, La Question du Bosphore et des Dardanelles (Geneva, 1915). E. Anchieri, Costantinopoli e gli Stretti nella politica russa ed europea dal Trattato di Qiicitik Rainardgi [sic] alla Convenzione di Montreux (Milan, 1948), concentrates heavily on the twentieth-century history of the subject. Both J. T. Shotwell and F. Déak, Turkey at the Straits: a Short History (New York, 1941), and B. A. Dranov, Chernomorskie prolivy (Moscow, 1948), are written largely from the standpoint of the international lawyer. The second is the fuller and better of the two. Barbara Jelavich, A Century of Russian Foreign Policy, 1814-1914 (Philadelphia-New York, 1964), is a useful short
survey of its subject. The most penetrating study of the evolution of the
Eee)


THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
Ottoman Empire into the Kemalist republic is B. Lewis, The Emergence of
Modern Turkey (London, 1961), while Sir Harry Luke, The Old Turkey and the New (London, 1955), is interesting on the same subject.
Introduction The best book on most aspects of the life of the Ottoman Empire in the eighteenth century is H. A. R. Gibb and H. Bowen, Islamic Society and the West: i, Islamic Society in the Eighteenth Century (2 pts.) (London, 1950-7). It is considerably fuller on the Arab provinces than on the Balkans. The issue of the Slavic Review for December 1962 contains articles by W. S. Vucinich, on ‘The Nature of Balkan Society under Ottoman Rule’; by S. J. Shaw on ‘The Aims and Achievements of Ottoman Rule in the Balkans’; and by T. Stoianovich on ‘Factors in the Decline of Ottoman Society’, which throw light on a number of aspects of Turkish rule in the Balkans. T. Stoianovich, ‘The Conquering Balkan Orthodox Merchant’, Journal of Economic History, xx (1960), 234-313, is a long article of much wider interest than its title would suggest which contains much new information on the economic history of the area. On the Arab provinces there is A. Hourani, ‘The changing face of the Fertile Crescent in the Eighteenth Century’, Studia Islamica, viii (1957), 89-122. The slowly-growing influence of western ideas and techniques in the Ottoman Empire is discussed in the book by B. Lewis mentioned above and in E. Z. Karal, ‘La transformation de la Turquie d’un empire oriental en un état moderne et national’, Journal of World History, iv (1958), 426-45.
Chapter I The only work of any substance on the treaty of Kutchuk—Kainardji is E. I. Druzhinina, Kyuchuk—Kainardzhiiskii mir 1774 goda (Moscow, 1955), which includes a full account, from the Russian standpoint, of the diplomacy of the war of 1768-74. The old but still useful A. Sorel, La Question d’Orient au XVIII siecle, 4th ed. (Paris, 1902; English translation, London, 1898) throws light on various aspects of the same subject. The best general account of Russian policy in the Near East until the signature of the treaty of Jassy in 1792 is to be found in H. Uebersberger, Russlands Orientpolitik in den letzten Kwei Fahrhunderten, i (Stuttgart, 1913), while B. Nolde, La Formation de Vempire russe, li (Paris, 1953), gives a great deal of information on the growth of the Russian Empire in the Black Sea area, the Caucasus and Bessarabia. M.S. Anderson, “The Great Powers and the Russian Annexation of the Crimea, 1783-4’, Slavonic and East European Review, xxxvii (19581959), 17-41, discusses the diplomacy of one of the major Russian territorial gains of this period, while N. A. Smirnov, Politika Rossii na Kavkaze v AVI-XIX vekakh (Moscow, 1958), is useful on expansion in the Caucasus. On French policy in the Near East during this period the best book is L. Pingaud, Choiseul-Gouffier : la France en Orient sous Louis XVI (Paris, 1887), while the early part of A. Beer, Die orientalische Politik Osterreichs seit 1774 (Prague, 1883), is the only large-scale work on that of Austria. On the diplomacy of the Russo—Turkish war of 1787-92 there is much in R, H.

BIBLIOGRAPHY
Lord, The Second Partition of Poland (Cambridge, Mass., 1915), and, in a more limited way, in J. Holland Rose, William Pitt and National Revival (London, 1912). The best account of the crisis of 1791 is D. Gerhard, England und der Aufsteig Russlands (Munich-Berlin, 1933), chap. vi, while British popular resistance to Pitt’s policy is discussed in M. S. Anderson, Britain’s Discovery of Russia, 1553-1815 (London, 1958), chap. vi. B. Lewis, “The Impact of the French Revolution on Turkey’, Journal of World History, i (1953-4), 105-25, is useful. The standard work on the background to the French invasion of Egypt is still F. Charles-Roux, Les Origines de I’Expédition d’Egypte (Paris, 1910), while H. Déhérain, La Vie de Pierre Ruffin, orientaliste et diplomate (Paris, 1929-30), i, is also of interest.
Chapter IT
The best account of the diplomacy of the French invasion of Egypt and of the following years is T. Naff, Ottoman Diplomacy and the Great European Powers, 1797-1802 (London Ph.D. thesis, 1960). On a smaller scale there is J. Holland Rose, “The Political Reactions of Bonaparte’s Eastern Expedition’, English Historical Review, xliv (1929), 48-58, while S. Ghorbal, The Beginnings of the Egyptian Question and the Rise of Mehemet Ali (London, 1928), is an excellent account of the international rivalries involving Egypt down to 1811. P. Mackesy, The War in the Mediterranean, 1803-10 (London, 1957), brings out very well from the British point of view the interconnections of strategy and diplomacy. On Russian policy in general during this period there is the rather disappointing A. Lobanov-Rostovsky, Russia and Europe, 1789-1825 (Durham, N.C., 1947), which gives considerable attention to the history of military operations; and on Russo—French relations A. Vandal, Napoléon et Alexandre I® (Paris, 1891-4: 3 vols.), and the briefer S. Tatistcheff, Alexandre I°? et Napoléon (Paris, 1891). On Russian expansion in the Caucasus there are, in addition to the book of Nolde mentioned above, A. R. Ioannissian, Prisoedinenie Zakavkazya k Rossii i mezhdunarodme otnosheniya v nachale XIX stoletiya (Erevan, 1958), of which I have not seen a copy, and D. M. Lang, A Modern History of Georgia (London, 1962). On Russian policy in the Mediterranean and at the Straits there are the useful article of A. L. Shapiro, ‘Sredizemnomorskie problemy politiki Rossii v nachale XIXv.’, Istoricheskie Zapiski, lv (1956), 253-88; the important book of A. M. Stanislavskaya, Russko-angliiskie otnosheniya i problemy sredizemnomor’ya (1798-1807gg.) (Moscow, 1962); the same author’s “Grecheskii vopros vo vneshnei politike Rossii v nachale XIXv. (1798-1807gg.)’, Istoricheskie Zapiski, \xviii (1961), 142-62; and the significant article of J. C. Hurewitz, ‘Russia and the Turkish Straits: a Revaluation of the Origins of the Problem’, World Politics, xiv (1961-2), 605-32. There is a considerable literature on French activities in the Near East during the Napoleonic period. The most recent work is V. J. Puryear, apoleon and the Dardanelles (Berkeley-Los Angeles, 1951). More limited in scope are E. Rodocanachi, Bonaparte et les [les Ioniennes (Paris, 1899); P. Pisani, La Dalmatie de 1797 4 1815 (Paris, 1893); and A. Boppe, L’ Albanie et Napoléon (1797-1814) (Paris, 1914). P. F. Shupp, The European Powers and the Near Eastern Question, 1806-7

THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
(New York, 1931), is a creditable attempt to grapple with a very large subject. On the reforms of Selim III and the collapse at the end of his reign there is much in Baron A. de Juchereau de Saint Denys, Les Révolutions de Constantinople en 1807 et 1808 (Paris, 1819: 2 vols.); the most important modern work is A. F. Miller, Mustafa Pasha Bairaktar: Ottomanskaya Imperiya v nachale XIX veka (Moscow, 1947). The best biography of Ali Pasha of Jannina is G. Rémérand, Ali de Tébélen, Pasha de Janina (1744-1822) (Paris, 1928), which is based largely on the archives of the French embassy at Constantinople; J. W. Bagally, Ali Pasha and Great Britain (Oxford, 1938), covers its rather limited subject well. On the Serb revolt the standard works in a western language are G. Yakchitch, L’ Europe et la résurrection de la Serbie (1804-1834) (Paris, 1917), and E. Haumant, La Formation de la Yougoslavie (Paris, 1930). S. Gopchevich, Russland und Serbien von 1804-1915 (Munich, 1916) is also of interest; in spite of its title it deals almost entirely with the early nineteenth century and includes material from the Russian archives. A recent Russian view of the revolt is given in V. V. Zelenin, ‘Iz istorii agrarnykh otnoshenii v Serbii vo vremya pervogo vostaniya’, Novaya Noveishaya Istoriya, 1958, No. 5, pp. 79-93. On the background to the Greek revolt the most important recent work is N. Botzaris, Visions balkaniques dans la préparation de la révolution grécque (Paris-Geneva, 1962): it brings out very well the extent to which the Greek leaders originally aimed at the liberation of the entire Balkans and not merely of Greece from Turkish rule. The intellectual preparation for the development of Greek nationalism is discussed in R. Demos, “The neo-Hellenic Enlightenment, 1750-1821’, Journal of the History of Ideas, xix (1958), 523-41. C. W. Crawley, ‘John Capodistrias and the Greeks before 1821’, Cambridge Historical Journal, xili (1957), 162-82, is interesting; and D. Dakin, “The origins of the Greek revolution of 1821’, History, xxxvii (1952), 228-35, is a useful short survey.
Chapter IIT
The most complete general account of the diplomacy of the Greek war of independence is to be found in E. Driault and M. Lhéritier, Histoire diplomatique de la Gréce (Paris, 1925-6), i. There is an excellent English account in C, W. Crawley, The Question of Greek Independence, 1821-1833 (Cambridge, 1930), while C. M. Woodhouse, The Greek War of Independence (London, 1952) is shorter and more concerned with military events but includes an excellent introductory chapter. The same author’s The Battle of Navarino (London, 1965) covers the diplomatic background to the battle as well as the fighting of it. British policy is treated in considerable detail by Crawley and can also be followed in H. W. V. Temperley, The Foreign Policy of Canning, 1822-7 (London, 1925). That of France is covered by the dull but thorough V. J. Puryear, France and the Levant from the Bourbon Restoration to the Peace of Kutiah (Berkeley—Los Angeles, 1941). On that of Austria the only monograph appears to be E. Molden, Die Orientpolitik des Fiirsten Metternich, 1829-1833 (Vienna—Leipzig, 1913). On philhellenism the most recent and complete work is D. Dakin, British and American Philhellenes
402


BIBLIOGRAPHY
during the War of Greek Independence, 1821-1833 (Thessaloniki, 1955). On
Russia’s share in the achievement of Greek independence the best book is A. V. Fadeev, Rossiya i vostochnyi krizis 20-x godov XIX veka (Moscow, 1958), which is based on extensive research and much Russian archive material. S. S. Tatishchev, Vneshnaya politika Nikolaya pervogo (St. Petersburg, 1887), is an important older book by an official historian. T. Schiemann, Geschichte Russlands unter Nikolaus I (Berlin, 1904-19; four vols.) is useful, particularly since it prints in appendices, notably in vol. i, a considerable number of documents relating to Russian foreign policy in this period. O. Shparo, ‘Rol’ Rossii v borbe Gretsii za nezavisimost’, Voprosy Istorii 1949 No. 8, Pp. 52-73, makes some excessive claims but contains some interesting information. The most balanced general assessment of Mohammed Ali, though perhaps unduly favourable to the Pasha, is still H. Dodwell, The Founder ofModern Egypt: A Study ofMuhammad’ Ali (Cambridge, 1931). The early pages of N. Safran, Egypt in Search of Political Community (Cambridge, Mass., 1961) present a more critical picture of his regime. The most complete account of his foreign policy is M.Sabry, L’Empire égyptien sous Mohamed-Ali et la question d’Orient (1811-1849) (Paris, 1930), but the book is marred by occasional carelessness and a strong anti-British bias. The crisis of 1832-33 can be followed in Sabry’s book, in Sir Charles Webster, The Foreign Policy of Palmerston, 1830-1841 (London, 1951), i, and in S. Goriainov, Le Bosphore et les Dardanelles (Paris, 1910), Chap. viii (though in general this book hardly deserves its reputation). N. S. Kinyapina, Vneshnaya politika Rossit pervoi poloviny XIXv. (Moscow, 1963), is in the main a disappointing compilation from printed materials; but its treatment of the signature of the treaty of Unkiar—Skelessi includes new material from the Russian archives. M. Vereté, ‘Palmerston and the Levant Crisis, 1832’, Journal af Modern History, xxiv (1952), 143-51, is an article of importance.
Chapter IV
The books by Sabry and above all by Webster mentioned above continue to be important. V. J. Puryear, International Economics and Diplomacy in the Near East, 1834-1853 (Stanford, 1935), is opinionated but contains much material. Different aspects of Britain’s relations with the Ottoman Empire in the 1830s are illustrated by F. S. Rodkey, ‘Lord Palmerston and the Rejuvenation of Turkey’, Journal of Modern History, i (1929), 570-93; G. H. Bolsover, ‘David Urquhart and the Eastern Question, 1833-37’, ibid. vili (1936), 444-67; and H.L. Hoskins, British Routes to India (New York, 1928). F. E. Bailey, British Policy and the Turkish Reform Movement (Cambridge, Mass., 1942), Overstates its case and fails to prove it but is of some interest. G. H. Bolsover, ‘Nicholas I and the Partition of Turkey’, Slavonic and East European Review, xxvii (1948-9), 115-45, is an important article based largely on material from the Austrian archives, while P. E. Mosely, Russian Diplomacy and the Opening of the Eastern Question in 1838 and 1839 (Cambridge, Mass., 1934), is an excellent short discussion which draws on Russian archive materials. J. H. Gleason, The Genesis of Russophobia in Great Britain, 1815-41
(Cambridge, Mass., 1950), attempts to relate the movement of British

1921-25 THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
public opinion to that of British policy. Much light has recently been thrown on Mohammed Ali’s regime in Syria by W. R. Polk, The Opening of South Lebanon, 1788-1840 (Cambridge, Mass., 1963). On the crisis of 1839-41 there are, in addition to several works already mentioned, C.-H. Pouthas, ‘La Politique de Thiers pendant la crise orientale de 1840’, Revue Historique, clxxxii (1938), 72-96; F. Charles-Roux, Thiers et Méhémet-Ali: la grande crise orientale et européenne de 1840-1841 (Paris, 1951); and H. W. V. Temperley, England and the Near East: The Crimea (London, 1936), Book II. J. C. Hurewitz, ‘Ottoman diplomacy and the European state system’, Middle East Journal, Spring 1961, pp. 141-52, provides interesting background information with some particular reference to the subject of this chapter.
Chapter V
There are two useful recent bibliographical articles on the Crimean War: E. Hésch, ‘Neuere Literatur tiber den Krimkrieg’, Fahrbiicher fiir Geschichte Osteuropas, Neue Folge, ix (1961), 399-433; and B. D. Gooch, “A century of historiography on the origins of the Crimean War’, American Historical Review, \xii (1956), 33-58; the former is particularly full. The best-known large-scale treatment in Russian is E. V. Tarlé, Krimskaya Voina (Moscow-Leningrad, 1941-3; later editions appeared in 1944-5 and 1950). It lays heavy stress on the alleged economic causes of the war, shows a strong antiBritish bias (it is particularly hostile to Stratford de Redcliffe) and pays much attention to military events. From the British standpoint the most complete treatment of the causes of the war is ‘Temperley’s England and the Near East, referred to in the bibliography to the last chapter; V. J. Puryear’s International Economics and Diplomacy in the Near East, 1834-1853 can be supplemented for the Crimean War period by his England, Russia and the Straits Question, 1844-1856 (Berkeley, 1931). The best treatment of France’s share in the events which led to the war is still probably E. Bapst, Les Origines de la Guerre de Crimée : la France et la Russie de 1848 a 1854 (Paris, 1912), which is in some ways limited in scope but is based on a thorough use of the French archives. The Russophobia of much British public opinion in 1853-4 is vividly described in Kingsley Martin, The Triumph of Lord Palmerston, revised ed. (London, 1963); A. J. P. Taylor, ‘John Bright and the Crimean War’, Bulletin of the John Rylands Library, xxxvi (1954), 501-22, is interesting on a minor aspect of the same subject. G. B. Henderson, Crimean War Diplomacy and other Historical Essays (Glasgow, 1947), contains a number of penetrating studies of various aspects of the diplomacy of the war, while W. E. Mosse, The Rise and Fall of the Crimean System, 1855-71: The Story of a Peace Settlement (London, 1963), is a collection of essays, based on very thorough research, which deal with the peace settlement and the failure to uphold it. The relevant pages of the same author’s The European Powers and the German Question, 1848-71 (Cambridge, 1958), also provide useful background to the war, and the Vicomte E. de Guichen, La Guerre de Crimée
(1854-6) et Pattitude des puissances européennes (Paris, 1936), is important though rather poorly constructed. H. Friedjung, Der Krimkrieg und di:
404.


BIBLIOGRAPHY
Osterreichische Politik (Stuttgart—Berlin, 1911), is the standard work on the
wavering but crucially important attitude of Austria to the war, a subject
which is also touched on in F. Valsecchi, II Risorgimento el’ Europa: L’ Alleanza di Crimea (Milan, 1948). On Prussia there is K. Borries, Preussen im Krimkrieg (1853-1856) (Stuttgart, 1930), a substantial account based in part on Prussian archive materials. On the peace of 1856, in addition to the books mentioned above, there are H. W. V. Temperley, ‘The Treaty of Paris of 1856 and its Execution’, Journal of Modern History, iv (1932), 387-414, 523-43; and W.E. Mosse, ‘The Negotiations for a Franco—Russian Convention, 1856’, Cambridge Historical Journal, x (1850-52), 59-74.
Chapter VI
There is a good deal of useful background to many of the events discussed in this chapter in C. W. Crawley, “The Mediterranean’, which is Chapter xvi of The New Cambridge Modern History, vol. x. French policy is discussed in Alice E. Mange, The Near Eastern Policy of the Emperor Napoleon III (Illinois Studies in the Social Sciences, xxv, nos. 1-2: Urbana, 1940). Franco—Russian relations are discussed in F. Charles-Roux, Alexandre II, Gortchakoff et Napoléon III, 2nd ed. (Paris, 1913), and for the first years of the period in E. Schiile, Russland und Frankreich, 1856-59 (Berlin, 1935). There is no detailed account of British policy which covers the whole period; K. Bell, The Constantinople Embassy of Sir Henry Bulwer, 1858-65 (London Ph.D. thesis, 1961), is useful. There is a considerable literature on the question of the Danubian Principalities. The relevant chapters of R. W. Seton-Watson, A History of the Rumanians (Cambridge, 1934), provide a good general account. The most detailed study is T. W. Riker, The Making of Rumania: a Study of an International Problem, 1856-1866 (Oxford, 1931), which is based on very wide research. W. G. East, The Union of Moldavia and Wallachia, 1859: An Episode in Diplomatic History (Cambridge, 1929), is also useful though more limited in scope. V. N. Vinogradov, Rossiya i ob’edinenie rumynskikh knyazhestv (Moscow, 1961), is a substantial study. It covers the period only to 1859, but is based on extensive use of Russian archive material. W. E. Mosse, ‘England, Russia and the Rumanian Revolution of 1866’, Slavonic and East European Review, xxxix (1960-61), 73-94, is an important recent article. The Syrian crisis of 1859-60 is covered in the book by Mange mentioned above, and more generally in J. Nantet, Histoire du Liban (Paris, 1963). M. Emerit, ‘La crise Syrienne et l’expansion économique frangais en 1860’, Revue Historique, ccvii (1952), 211-32, throws interesting new light on this aspect of French policy. On the Cretan crisis there are K. Bourne, ‘Great Britain and the Cretan Revolt, 1866-1869’, Slavonic and East European Review, xxxv (1956-57), 74-94; and Maureen M. Robson, “Lord Clarendon and the Cretan Question’, Historical Journal, iii (1960), 38-55. N. lorga, ‘L,’Origine des idées d’indépendence balkanique’, Le Monde Slave, iv (1927), 73-93, has points of interest on the evolution of Balkan nationalism during this period. Of Bulgarian nationalism the best account is still probably A. Hajek, Bulgarien unter der Tiirkenherrschaft (Berlin—Leipzig, 1925), particularly chaps. vi, vii, x and xi. There is a recent Soviet account in the
405


THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
collective work Istoriya Bolgarii (Moscow, 1954), i, while C. E. Black, “The
Influence of Western Political thought in Bulgaria, 1850-1885’, American
Historical Review, xlviii (1942-3), 507-20, is an article of importance. The complexity of the Macedonian problem and the bitterness of the rivalries to which it gave rise find an original illustration in H. R. Wilkinson, Maps and Politics: a Review of the Ethnographic Cartography of Macedonia (Liverpool, 1951); E. Haumant, ‘Les origines de la lutte pour la Macédoine, (18551872)’, Le Monde Slave, iti (1926), 52-66, is a good discussion of the emergence of the problem in this period. The growing movement for political change in the Ottoman Empire can be followed in S. Mardin, The Genesis of Young Ottoman Thought (Princeton, 1962); in Yu. A. Petrosyan, ‘Nouye Osmany’ i borba za konstitutsiyu 1876g. v Turtsti (Moscow, 1958); and above all in the great work of R. H. Davison, Reform in the Ottoman Empire, 1856-1876 (Princeton, 1963). All make extensive use of Turkish printed materials. On Panslavism in Russia there are two substantial recent works in English: M. B. Petrovich, The Emergence of Russian Panslavism, 1856-1870 (New York, 1956), and F. Fadner, Seventy Years of Pan-Slavism in Russia: Karazin to Danilevskii, 1800-1870 (Washington, 1962). Of the older A. Fischel, Der Panslavismus bis zum Weltkrieg (Stuttgart—Berlin, 1919), Chapter ix is relevant here. A detailed recent Russian work is S. A. Nikitin, Slavyanskie komitety v Rossii v 1858-1876 godakh (Moscow, 1960). The standard work on the Suez Canal is C. W. Hallberg, The Suez Canal: its History and Diplomatic Importance (New York, 1931) ; Chapters x—xiii deal with the building of the canal, as do Chapters xii and xiv of Hoskins, British Routes to India. The Egyptian background to the canal project is brilliantly described in D. S. Landes, Bankers and Pashas: International Finance and Economic Imperialism in Egypt (London, 1958). B. H. Sumner, ‘Ignatyev at Constantinople, 1864-1874’, Slavonic and East European Review, xi (1932-3), 341-53, 556-71, is useful on Russian policy in the later 1860s and early 1870s, while W. E. Mosse, “The end of the Crimean system: England, Russia and the neutrality of the Black Sea, 1870-71’, Historical Journal, iv (1961), 164-90, is an important article.
Chapter VII
There are more good books on the crisis of 1875-78 than on any other aspect of the history of the Eastern Question. M. D. Stoyanovich, The Great Powers and the Balkans, 1875-1878 (Cambridge, 1939), is useful as a relatively brief but comprehensive treatment. There is also a sound general account in W.L. Langer, European Alliances and Alignments, 1871-1890 (New York, 1950), Chaps. iii-v. The first part of A. Novotny, Quellen und Studien zur Geschichte des Berliner Kongresses 1878, vol. i, Osterreich, die Turkei und das Balkanproblem im Jahre des Berliner Kongresses (Graz-Kéln, 1957) contains an excellent account of the work of the congress; the remainder of the book prints summaries of relevant documents from the Austrian archives. The same author’s ‘Das Berliner Kongress und das Problem einer europdischen Politik’, Historische Zeitschrift, clxxxvi (1958), is suggestive. On a larger scale there is D. Harris, A Diplomatic History of the Balkan Crisis of 1875-1878: the
406


BIBLIOGRAPHY
First Year (Stanford, 1936), which is an immensely detailed narrative of the events of 1875-6 based on very thorough use of the British and Austrian archives; and W.N. Medlicott, The Congress of Berlin and After (London, 1938), which provides an excellent account of the congress and of the detailed working-out of the settlement of 1878. On Russian policy the outstanding work is B. H. Sumner, Russia and the Balkans, 1870-1880 (London, 1962): S. Goriainov, La Question d’Orient a la veille du traité de Berlin (18701876) (Paris, 1948), in fact goes down to 1878, in spite of its title, and is based on the Russian archives; while D. MacKenzie, ‘Panslavism in Practice: Cherniaev in Serbia (1876)’, Journal of Modern History, xxxvi (1964), 279-97 throws some light upon Russian policy. G. H. Rupp, A Wavering Friendship ; Russia and Austria, 1876-1878 (Cambridge, Mass., 1941), is also important. On British policy there is much in several of the books already mentioned, especially those of Harris and Medlicott; there are also G. Wirthwein, Britain and the Balkan Crisis, 1875-1878 (New York, 1935); D. Harris, Britain and the Bulgarian Horrors of 1876 (Chicago, 1939); and R. W. Seton-Watson, Disraeli, Gladstone and the Eastern Question (London, 1933). R. T. Shannon, Gladstone and the Bulgarian Agitation, 1876 (London, 1963) does not really deal with the Eastern Question at all but is a brilliant study of British opinion regarding it during that year. W. N. Medlicott, ‘Bismarck and Beaconsfield’, in Studies in Diplomatic History and Historiography in Honour of G. P. Gooch, C.H., ed. A. O. Sarkissian (London, 1961), is an article of importance, while D. E. Lee, Great Britain and the Cyprus Convention Policy of 1878 (Cambridge, Mass., 1934), is a useful book whose scope is much wider than its title suggests. Two famous biographies, Lady Gwendolen Cecil, Life of Robert, Marquis of Salisbury, two vols. (London, 1921), and W. F. Monypenny and G. E. Buckle, The Life of Benjamin Disraeli, vol. vi, 1876-1881 (London, 1920), are of fundamental importance. On the developments of the period in the Ottoman Empire, in addition to the book by R. H. Davison mentioned in the bibliography to the last chapter, there is the thorough work of R. Devereux, The First Ottoman Constitutional Period: a Study of the Midhat Constitution and Parliament (Baltimore, 1963). R. V. Burks, ‘Romania and the Balkan Crisis of 1875-8’, Fournal of Central European Affairs, ti (1942-3), 119-34, 310-20, is the best short study of Rumania’s share in the events of these years; and V. I. Ado, “Berlinskii kongress 1878g. i pomeshchiche-burzhyaznoe obshchestvennoe mnenie Rossii’, Istoricheskie Zapiski, Ixix (1961), 101-41, is of interest on the reception of the 1878 settlement by Russian public opinion. R. W. Seton-Watson, “The role of Bosnia in international politics (1875-1914)’, Proceedings of the British Academy, xvii (1931), 335-68, is a useful article.
Chapter VIII
For this period the relevant chapters of W. L. Langer, European Alliances and
Alignments, mentioned in the bibliography to the last chapter, and of the same author’s The Diplomacy of Imperialism, 1890-1902 (New York, 1951), provide a detailed account of Near Eastern developments. For the period
immediately after 1878 there is the very thorough and perceptive W. N.
407


THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
Medlicott, Bismarck, Gladstone and the Concert of Europe (London, 1956), and
the excellent and enormously detailed W. Windelband, Bismarck und die
europdischen Grossméchte, 1879-1885 (Essen, 1942). For treatment of various
aspects of the later history of the 1878 settlement see C. Jelavich, “The revolt
in Bosnia—Herzegovina, 1881-2’, Slavonic and East European Review, xxx
(1952-3), 420-36; S. Skendi, ‘Beginnings of Albanian nationalist and
autonomist trends: the Albanian League, 1878-1881’, American Slavic and
East European Review, xii (1953), 219-32; and W. N. Medlicott, “The Glad
stone government and the Cyprus Convention, 1880-85’, Fournal of Modern
History, xii (1940), 186-208. The question of the Ottoman Debt and its implications can be followed in A. du Velay, Essai sur histoire financiére de la Turquie (Paris, 1903), and D. C. Blaisdell, European Financial Control in the Ottoman Empire (New York, 1929). On events in Bulgaria there is A. M. Hyde, A Diplomatic History of Bulgaria from 1870 to 1886 (University of Illinois Studies in the Social Sciences, xvi, No. 3: Urbana, 1928) which is competent as far as it goes but uses no materials in any Slav language. Much better is C. Jelavich, Tsarist Russia and Balkan Nationalism: Russian Influence in the Internal Affairs of Bulgaria and Serbia, 1879-1886 (Berkeley—Los Angeles, 1958), which uses the private correspondence of Giers as well as much printed material in Russian and Bulgarian. There is another excellent account of Russian policy in Bulgaria in S$. Skazkin, Konets Avstro—RusskoGermanskogo soyuza, vol. i, 1879-1884 (Moscow, 1928), while A. Hajek, Bulgariens Befreiung und staatliche Entwicklung unter seinen ersten Fiirsten (MunichBerlin, 1939), is a substantial study covering the period from 1877 to the fall of Alexander of Battenberg. Similar ground is very well covered in C. E, Black, The Establishment of Constitutional Government in Bulgaria (Princeton, 1943). The complex crisis or series of crises of 1885-7 can be followed in C. L. Smith, The Embassy of Sir William White at Constantinople, 1886-1891 (Oxford, 1957); W. N. Medlicott, ‘The powers and the unification of the two Bulgarias, 1885’, English Historical Review, liv (1939), 67-82, 263-84; the same author’s “The Mediterranean Agreements of 1887’, Slavonic and East European Review, v (1926), 60-88; and V.M. Khostov, ‘Rossiya i germanskaya aggressiya v dni evropeiskogo krizisa 1887g.’, Istoricheskie Kapiski, xviii (1946), 201-54. J. V. Fuller, Bismarck’s Diplomacy at its Zenith (Cambridge, Mass., 1922), is still of value on the events of these years. The best account of the British occupation of Egypt is to be found in Chaps. iv and v of R. Robinson and J. Gallagher, Africa and the Victorians (London,
1961); Chaps. viii, ix, x and xii discuss various results of the occupation. The
financial collapse of the Egyptian government in the 1870s is well illustrated
by J. Bouvier, “Les intéréts financiers et la question d’Egypte (1875-1876)’,
Revue Historique, ccxxiv (1960), 75-104, while L. E. Roberts, ‘Italy and the
Egyptian Question, 1878-1882’, Journal of Modern History, xviii (1946),
314-32, illuminates a side-issue of some importance. M. P. Hornik, “The
mission of Sir Henry Drummond-Wolff to Constantinople, 1885-7’

Chapter LX
There is a good deal on German activity in the Balkans and the Near East
in H.C. Meyer, Mitteleuropa in German Thought and Action (The Hague,
1955), and in the same author’s ‘German economic relations with south
eastern Europe, 1870-1914’, American Historical Review, Ixvii (1951-2),
47-90. Other useful articles on the subject are M. L. Flaningam, ‘German
eastward expansion, fact and fiction’, Fournal of Central European Affairs, xiv
(1954-5), 319-33, and W. O. Henderson, “German economic penetration of
the Near East, 1870-1914’, Economic History Review, xviii (1948), 54-64.

THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
1897-1912 (Danzig, 1934), is a competent published thesis based on printed
materials. The best general account of the economic activities of the great
powers in the Near East is to be found in the relevant chapters of H. Feis,
Europe the World’s Banker, 1870-1914 (New Haven, 1930). There is a considerable literature on the Baghdad Railway. Maybelle K. Chapman, Great Britain and the Baghdad Railway (Smith College Studies in History, xxxi: Northampton, Mass., 1948); J. Wolf, The Diplomatic History of the Baghdad Railroad (University of Missouri Studies, xi, No. 2, 1936); and L. Ragey, La Question du chemin de fer de Baghdad, 1893-1914 (Paris, 1936), are all good and relatively short accounts. There is still much of value in the older book of E. M. Earle, Turkey, the Great Powers and the Baghdad Railway (New York, 1923). I have not seen a copy of G. L. Bondarevskii, Bagdadskaya zheleznaya doroga i proniknovenie germanskogo imperializma na Blizhnii Vostok (18881903) (Tashkent, 1955), which appears to the only recent large-scale Russian work on the subject. Of the Macedonian question the best account is to be found in Dorothy B. Goodman, The Emergence of the Macedonian Problem and Relations between the Balkan States and the Great Powers, 1897 to 1903 (London Ph.D. thesis, 1955). It is particularly good on the Macedonian revolutionary groups and the policies of the Balkan states. Mrs. M. A. Harben, Great Britain and the Macedonian Question, 1903-8 (London M.Sc. thesis, 1963) is also useful. G. Monger, The End of Isolation: British Foreign Policy, 1900-1907 (London, 1963), though not specifically concerned with the Near East, throws much light on all aspects of British policy during these years. The growing tension between Serbia and the Habsburg Empire after 1903 can be studied in W. S. Vucinich, Serbia between East and West: the Events of 1903-1908 (Stanford, 1954), which makes extensive use of materials in Sebo-Croat. S. Wank, ‘Aehrenthal and the Sanjak of Novibazar Railway Project’, Slavonic and East European Review, xlii (1963-4), 353-69, throws some new light on the policies of the Austrian Foreign Minister, while B. Schmitt, The Annexation of Bosnia (Cambridge, 1937), is the best book on its subject. Russian policy in the crisis of 1908-09 can be followed in A. N. Mandelstam, ‘La Politique russe d’accés a la Mediterranée au XX2. siécle’, Academie de Droit International, Receuil des Cours, 1934, Vol. i, 597-802; in V. I. Bovykin, Ocherki istorii vneshnei politiki Rossii: konets XIX veka — 1917 god (Moscow, 1960), a useful survey based on printed materials; and in P. N. Efremov, Vneshnaya politika Rossii 1907-1914gg. (Moscow, 1961), Chap. iii, which is also based on printed materials only. I. V. Bestuzhev, Borba v Rossit po voprosam vneshnei politiki, 1906-1910gg. (Moscow, 1961), has important material on the state of Russian public opinion during these years. On the Young Turks the best book is E. E. Ramsauer, The Young Turks: Prelude to the Revolution of 1908 (Princeton, 1957), while there is a considerable literature on the growth of Arab nationalism before 1914. The
pioneering work of G. Antonius, The Arab Awakening (London, 1938), is still
important, while more recent accounts can be found in Z. N. Zeine
Arab—Turkish Relations and the Emergence of Arab Nationalism (Beirut, 1958);
M. Colombe, ‘Islam et nationalisme arabe a la veille de la premiére guerre
mondiale’, Revue Historique, ccxxiii (1960), 85-98; C. E. Dawn, ‘The rise of

Chapter X W. CG. Askew, Europe and Italy’s Acquisition of Libya, 1911-1912 (Durham, N.C., 1942), is a useful book, while A. Torre, La Politica Estera dell’ Italia dal
1896 al 1914 (Bologna, 1960), is an extremely detailed factual narrative account of which Chap. vi deals with the war of 1911-12. Charykov’s activities in the Turkish capital at the end of 1911 are covered in P. E. Mosely, ‘Russian Policy in 1911-12”, Journal of Modern History, xii (1940), 69-86; E. C. Thaden, ‘Charykov and Russian foreign policy at Constantinople in 1911’, Journal of Central European Affairs, xvi (1956-7), 25-44; and Chap. iv of the book by Efremov mentioned in the bibliography to the last chapter. On the Balkan Wars the standard work is the solid E. C. Helmreich, The Diplomacy of the Balkan Wars (Cambridge, Mass., 1938), while of some interest are E. C. Thaden, ‘Montenegro: Russia’s troublesome ally, 1g101912’, Journal of Central European Affairs, xviii (1958-9), 111-33; and H. Heilbronner, ‘The merger attempts of Serbia and Montenegro, 19131914’, ibid. 281-91. A. V. Ignatiev, Russko—Angliiskie otnosheniya nakanunye pervoi mirovoi voiny (1908-191 4gg.) (Moscow, 1962), is of some use though rather pedestrian. The most recent large-scale treatment of the events of 1914 and their antecedents is L. Albertini, The Origins of the War of 1914, three vols. (London, 1952-57) while there are stimulating discussions of the Sarajevo assassinations in J.Remak, Sarajevo, the Story of a Political Murder (London, 1959), and V. Dedijer, ‘Sarajevo fifty years after’, Foreign Affairs, July 1964,
pp: 569-84.
Chapter XT
H.N. Howard, The Partition of Turkey: a Diplomatic History, 1913-1923 (Norman, 1931), is still, though poorly-written and in some ways out of date, the best general account of great-power diplomacy in the Near East during and after the First World War. From the French point of view there is a detailed account in A. Pingaud, Histoire diplomatique de la France pendant la grande guerre, three vols. (Paris, 1938-40); while from that of Russia C. Jay Smith, The Russian Struggle for Power, 1914-17 (New York, 1956), is very useful. W. W. Gottlieb, Studies in Secret Diplomacy during the First World War (London, 1957), is interesting on Russian relations with Britain and France in 1914-15, while on the same subject on a smaller scale there are R. Kerner, ‘Russia, the Straits and Constantinople, 1914-15’, Journal of Modern History, i (1929), 400-15; and the same author’s ‘Russia and the Straits Question, 1915-1917’, Slavonic and East European Review, viii (19291930), 589-600. R. J. J. Mulligan, Great Britain, Russia and the Turkish Straits, 1908-1923 (London M.A. thesis, 1953), is a careful account based on published materials. On the Turkish war effort the best book is still A. Emin, Turkey in the World War (New Haven, 1930), while on Turkey’s entry into the struggle there is important new material in U. Trumpener, “Turkey’s
entry into World War I: an assessment of responsibilities’, Journal of Modern
4II


THE EASTERN QUESTION, 1774-1923
History, xxxix (1962), 369-80, and the same author’s ‘German military aid to Turkey in 1914: an historical re-evaluation’, Journal of Modern History, xxxii (1960), 145-9. The entry of Bulgaria into the war can be followed in J. M. Potts, ‘The Loss of Bulgaria’, in Russian Diplomacy and Eastern Europe (New York, 1963), and S. Sh. Greenberg, ‘Pervaya mirovaya voina i bolgarskii narod’, Istoricheskie Zapiski, xxi (1947), 202-21; that of Rumania is discussed in A. J. Rieber, ‘Russian Diplomacy and Rumania’, in Russian Diplomacy and Eastern Europe (New York, 1963), and V. A. Emets, ‘Protivorechiya mezhdu Rossiei i soyuznikami po voprosy o vstuplenii Rumynii vo voiny, (1915-1916gg.)’, Istoricheskie Kapiski, lvi (1956), 52-g0. On Serb policies C. Jelavich, ‘Nicholas P. Pasi¢; Greater Serbia or Jugoslavia’, Journal of Central European Affairs, xi (1951), 133-52, is of interest. On British relations with the Arabs and the Arab revolt the best book is E. Kedourie, England and the Middle East; the Destruction of the Ottoman Empire, 1914-1921 (London, 1956), while the same author’s ‘Cairo and Khartoum on the Arab Question, 1915-18’, Historical Journal, vii (1964), 280-97, is a stimulating article. The origins of the Balfour Declaration are discussed in C. Sykes, Two Studies in Virtue (London, i953), and, with greater penetration, in L. J. Stein, Weizmann and the Balfour Declaration (Rehovoth, 1964), which _ sums up many of the conclusions of the same author’s very detailed The Balfour Declaration (London, 1961).
Chapter XII
The best general accounts of the peace settlement in the Near East are to be found in H. W. V. Temperley (ed.), A History of the Peace Conference of Paris, Vol. vi (London, 1924), and in the relevant chapters of the book by H. N. Howard mentioned in the bibliography to the last chapter. C. H. Haskins and R. H. Lord, Some Problems of the Peace Conference (Cambridge, Mass., 1920), is a contemporary study with points of interest. On individual countries there are S. O. Spector, Rumania at the Paris Peace Conference (New York, 1962); R. Albrecht-Carrié, [taly at the Paris Peace Conference (New York, 1938); F. Déak, Hungary at the Peace Conference: the Diplomatic History of the Treaty of Trianon (New York, 1942); I. J. Lederer, Yugoslavia at the Paris Peace Conference (New Haven, 1963), and R. J. Kerner, “Yugoslavia and the Peace Conference’, in R. J. Kerner (ed.), Yugoslavia (Berkeley—Los Angeles, 1949). The Survey of International Affairs, 1920-1923 (London, 1927), is another useful source of information on many aspects of the settlement. The economic and social repercussions of the war in the Balkans are well discussed in D. Mitrany, The Effect of the War in Southeastern Europe (New Haven, 1936). For the settlement in the Arab areas and with Turkey H. H. Cumming, Franco—British Rivalry in the post-war Near East (London, 1938), is a useful study based on printed materials: Z. N. Zeine, The Struggle for Arab Independence: Western Diplomacy and the Rise and Fall of Feisal’s Kingdom in Syria (Beyrut, 1960), is more specialised in its scope, and the book by E. Kedourie mentioned in the bibliography to the last chapter continues to be important. Of the large literature dealing with the question of Palestine J. Marlowe, The Seat of Pilate: an Account of the Palestine Mandate (London,
412


BIBLIOGRAPHY
1959), and C. Sykes, Cross Roads to Israel (London, 1965), are the most recent and impartial large-scale treatments. H. N. Howard, An American Enquiry in the Middle East: the King-Crane Commission (Beyrut, 1963), is based on much hitherto unused manuscript material and throws a good deal of light on public opinion in the Arab countries. On the Kemalist movement the best book is Elaine D. Smith, Turkey: Origins of the Kemalist Movement and the Government of the Grand National Assembly (1919-1923) (Washington, 1959), which, though poorly written, is based on extensive use of Turkish printed materials. J. Benoist-Mechin, Mustapha Kemal, ou la mort d’un empire (Paris, 1954), is somewhat popular in style but useful; the best biography of Kemal is probably Lord Kinross, Ataturk: the Rebirth of a Nation (London, 1964), of which the first two-thirds cover the period down to 1923. R. H. Davison, “Turkish diplomacy from Mudros to Lausanne’, in The Diplomats, ed. G. A. Craig and F. Gilbert (Princeton, 1953), is an excellent relatively brief account. The Lausanne conference can be followed in the Earl of Ronaldshay, The Life of Lord Curzon, iti (London, 1929), and in Harold Nicolson’s very readable Curzon: the Last Phase (London, 1934). I have not seen J. C. Grew, “The Peace Conference of Lausanne’, Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, xcviii (1954), which is written by a participant. Russia’s policy in the Caucasus and with regard to the Turkish settlement can be followed in E. H. Carr, The Bolshevik Revolution, 1917-1923 (London, 1950), Vol. i. On Egypt there is a useful article by E. Kedourie, ‘Sa’ad Zaghlul and the British’, St. Anthony’s Papers, Vol. xi: Middle Eastern Affairs, No. 2 (London, 1961), 139-60. There are important general treatments in Lord Lloyd, Egypt since Cromer (London, 1933), and M. Colombe, L’ Evolution del’ Egypte, 1924-1950 (Paris, 1951).
