Lecture 1:

This is going to be gross.

Is it supposed to go?

I hope so.

Yeah.

It's pretty clear to us.

As a result of.

This.

Yeah.

I think.

So.

What is.

This?

Yeah.

I didn't set this course, but.

This one.

Did they put it last night?

No.

The middle is like a blank page with an x

y and with a B.

That's correct.

It's like an X-Men.

Assignment.

I was like, what about my voice?

I'm.

I'm not sure I like this one.

I'll tell you this for.

Sure.

Yeah.

Yeah, I think.

I understand.

Okay.

Um.

Okay, so those of you that don't know me, my

name is Jesus Levy.

Uh, I work.

My research and teaching are mostly in political class.

Um, sure.

We go around just to have your names and whatever

you in which you steal from.

So I am one, and I'm a fourth year.

I'm doing marketing.

But the reason I'm here is because I'm interested in

working with entrepreneurs and helping people.

Right.

That's awesome.

That's.

Yeah.

That's awesome.

Okay.

I'm watching.

I found yourself and I'm doing the same thing 30

years in the programs.

I'm doing this behaviour and.

I'm Laura, I'm doing the second year here.

I'm not doing a second yet.

I'm here and I'm doing this.

Uh.

I'm Ellen.

Uh, I'm a visiting student here at LSC, at my

home universities, all through university in Finland.

Uh, I'm.

I'm Mr. two student, and, uh, I'm, uh, I'm first

year student.

Has an interest in political economics and development.

Okay, so your first year.

Yeah.

For the PhD student.

Which student?

Sorry.

First year?

Yes.

Okay.

And you have time to pay.

All right.

So, um.

In terms of the structure of the course, uh, in

this term, uh, I'm splitting it with Thorsten Russell.

And what I'm going to do today is just give

you an introduction lecture to political economy, and then Torsten

will take over.

So he will teach four lectures next two, three, four

and five.

Then and then.

Okay.

Um.

This basic sort of, uh, what I, you know, what

we're doing in this course.

So, uh, there are going to be so we have

the lectures.

I'm sorry.

The the Moodle page is not updated here.

Lecture notes should be sorted out hopefully this weekend.

Um, throughout the lectures, uh, I will give some sort

of, uh, ideas for the problems that I would like

to So, uh, so there will be no formal process

that you need to, to submit, but, you know, it

will be your responsibility to actually work on this stuff.

Um, it would be great if you, you know, the

once I sort out the list because the pages moved

with the course was to have you.

Read as many papers as you can.

Um.

Last year, the the feedback was that it would be

good for students also to present some papers, ideas and

so on.

I'm a bit torn because there is a lot of

stuff that I want to tell you.

Uh, but if you want to present something.

So then then we can dedicate.

You know.

Paper.

So I will wait for you to initiate it.

Okay.

There is a paper that you think is interesting and

is sort of theory oriented then.

But I'm happy for you.

Okay.

Is there anything else administrative?

You.

Do have any questions?

Okay.

So start with with some history.

I want to tell you something.

So there are three seminars that you can go to

if you're interested.

Okay.

So one seminar, uh, is the main seminar when we

have where we have external visitors.

It's called the PSP seminar.

PSP is the political science and political economy.

That's on Tuesdays.

2:00 to 330.

And that's in room 305.

In the economics department, there is political, economy and economic

history student seminar.

It's called Speech seminar in Political Economy and Economic and

Economic History.

Okay, good.

And that's on Thursday.

That's 2:00.

I think it's 204.

And finally, there is a political economy work in progress

that is organised by the government department.

But a lot of students, our students are participating in

that.

Um, and that's on Wednesday.

That's 1:00.

Including lunch and pizza.

That's in the main sort of central building, six room

facility.

If you want to get on the reading or the

email list for these seminars or this, you can stick

around.

Uh, and these people write to me.

Okay.

Okay.

So political economy, uh, there was initially if you go

back in history, there was no economics.

That was not political.

So politics and economics were thought about as, you know,

something which is, uh, interconnected and, you know, really not

surprising when you think about economics.

I mean, of course, policy is such a part of

economics.

So Adam Smith and Ricardo, they were considered political economist.

Uh, and then actually, after the formation of all the

journals like the QG, which was the first journal, proper

journal in economics, uh, in the at least that I

know of in the Western world, uh, Chicago created the

Journal of Political Economy, but also most of these papers

at that point actually economics took on and political economy

as we know it today from the field early on.

And what, uh, what do we do in political economy?

So initially.

Initially there were two main strands.

Uh, one strand is to say, okay, let's stop.

Let's take everything that we've done in economics, okay?

Everything that we've done in economics, typically we think about

government making some fiscal policy or we think about some

benevolent planner.

Right.

But it doesn't make sense if we think about political

incentives.

These people do not necessarily have the benefit of society

in their mind.

So let's just repeat all the models that we did

in economics, mostly in macroeconomics, and replace the incentives of

the Okay.

Well, so it was not, you know, to a degree,

it was not, uh, a political economy discipline or political

philosophy of just let's take our economics model and change

them a little bit to make them more realistic.

Okay.

And the second strand, which is the more important one,

was to sort of look at fully integrate politics and

institutions and private decision makers, sort of a general equilibrium

theory.

That was the aim.

Uh, so think about, you know, if you think about

so many actors in the, in the political setup, you

have to I mean, similar to the general theory of

economics, you want to think about, uh, technology preferences, uh,

what are the different institutions that can mitigate these preferences

into a particular outcome.

It would be nice to get some general equilibrium results

in the political system.

The political system is to some degree and market.

Okay, I'll think about some of these parties is providing

maybe products to the consumers.

That is the voters.

You know, there may be other actors.

Uh, and we would like somehow to get the system

into an equilibrium and to and to and to get

some general result.

Now, you know, we can't really do it.

So we don't have general agreement theory, but we have

a lot of theories of partial equilibrium focusing on few

of these actors and trying to understand.

Okay.

What are we trying to understand?

If you come from political science.

There are a lot of questions that will be interesting,

like how many parties are we going to observe in

the parliamentary parliamentary system?

If you come from economics.

You know, it's a less, uh, it's a question that

is less interesting for you because you really want to

understand what is the eventual outcome.

So the number of parties is not interesting.

What we want to study, how it affects policy or

whether.

So that would be typically the questions that we would

be interested in.

You know, how does all this structure at the end

of the day affect affect?

Okay.

So what I want today is to give you to

to do two days to give you, um, so it's

going to be a little bit of a chronological introduction,

but I would also.

You know, take some detours and give you a taste

of the political economy.

I'll give you the basic models of electrocution.

Okay, so this would not repeat again in the introduction.

There would be there would be um, there would be

some content together with the important questions that we would

mainly tackle in the course, but also, you know, the

still ongoing questions that we don't have necessarily answer to.

From an historical point of view, uh, going to be

the ABCd lecture.

So we're going to discuss Aero Black Dance.

This is the basic thread.

Um.

Yeah okay.

So let me.

Let me just.

Start.

Can you stop me at any point for questions, discussion,

anything that comes to your mind if you go.

So we should interact.

Okay.

good.

So, uh, the important point for the start of modern

political economy is Arrow's impossibility theorem.

Uh, which was the the bedrock of what is called

social choice theory.

The idea of social choices to.

Um, think about the following.

So we know that individuals have preferences over different products.

So let's think about the society of individuals is different.

From these preferences that we think of as satisfying, the

requirement of rational preferences would be completely transitive.

From these preferences, we would somehow like to come up

with the mapping, the to take the set of preferences,

and would spit out associate degrees.

The cleanest way, from an economist point of view to

think about, you know what?

What should oh, how do we describe society?

Or also take it to normative, uh, discussions of what

society should be?

Okay.

So it would be somehow really ideal to think about

simply a machine, uh, nowadays algorithm, but in general, a

function that would map any set of preferences to a

social preference, social preference that would order all the different

alternatives.

Okay.

Let's abstract terms.

Okay.

Maybe people have, uh, endowments, uh, technology preferences and so

on.

And then from all of this, we decide how do

we decide how much to the equations.

Okay.

So that's the idea of social social choice.

And it would allow us both to rationalise political outcomes

that we observed.

So we can say, are these societies implementing those outcomes?

Typically we don't see the full order.

We only see we would hope to see maybe the

top outcome.

This society uses this outcome because these are the questions

okay.

But also we could put some requirements on this meeting.

Right.

We could say we would like this mapping to satisfy

fairness conditions.

Maybe so we can play with some normative requirements and

to say okay, this is given these preferences and the

moral requirements or not necessarily moral, maybe some stability requirement,

these requirements, then this is what we see in future

societies.

So we can come with uh with a recipe for

what what society.

And typically when we start with this complicated program problem,

we think, okay, what do we actually see around us

then?

Is this right?

If we're going to rationalise some some outcomes and we

see some procedures that are used to aggregate preferences, we

that's, that's maybe our first, uh, stab at the problem.

Okay.

So what do we see most.

What we see most is majority rule okay.

So that's a way to map preferences into a social

outcome okay.

Okay.

So is majority rule a good way to aggregate preferences.

So even though I said a b C d it's

not going to be I'm not going to start with

a I'm going to start with Condorcet okay.

French aristocrats 1750s and 60s something like that.

Um, so Condorcet.

State.

Has a deficient philosopher and has a lot of works

in political economy, we will encounter again.

Um, so Condorcet put up the following paradox.

Not sure the paradox is the right word, but he

said as follows.

Let's say there are at least let's say there are

three voters or three groups, and we have three options

A and C.

And let's look at the vector of preferences okay.

So voters one prefers a to b to c rather

two prefers b to c to a.

So this is one.

This is two.

And voters three prefers uh c.

So uh b.

Okay to be okay.

Okay.

Now let's do majority rule.

So if you start, you know the majority were between

two options.

So if you if you do a vote between A

and B it's 2 to 1, right.

Voters one and voter three prefer A to B.

So A is winning.

Now I'm painting A against C if you do A

versus C.

So here I was winning A versus C.

Now she's winning right.

What is two and three different states okay.

So you think okay C will be the outcome.

But then I can come and say wait, you know

why don't we vote between C and B.

Between C and B.

Now B is the outcome.

But of course B is losing two C to A

right, which is how we start.

Okay.

So what's the problem?

The problem is that the social preference is not.

Transitive.

And the same way that we wouldn't want any individual

person to have no trust.

We also wouldn't want society to have.

To a degree you can think about this as a

non stable outcome for society.

You know we can always find something that would be

better for the population.

So what did we use here.

We used uh at least three options because if we

just had two options we would find them.

Okay.

Let me think about the differences.

Okay.

So at least three options and uh, and and and

a particular set of.

Right.

We're not saying that for any set of preferences that

he would reach a long term outcome.

We're saying, look, if you're looking for something general that

would apply for all preferences, it's not going, you know,

we're not this majority work does not create a mapping

that would always guarantee to us, uh, a rational thought.

Okay.

So that's the that's that was the negative result of

going to say already.

250.

Yeah.

Good, good.

Okay.

Good.

Okay, so here comes the arrow that formalises this problem.

Okay.

Arrow formula.

So.

You know, we waited 200 years for a general formulation

of the problem.

So it's not surprising that the arrow worked on this.

So, you know, writing the general equilibrium paper, having this

idea of, you know, let's look at society and how

we aggregate preferences now.

So it's it makes a lot of sense.

Okay.

So arrow sets up the following problem.

Okay.

So we have an agents.

So three and more okay.

We have a set of alternatives.

As we as we've seen here we want to and

more.

Otherwise we I mean, it's a trivial problem.

And typically we have more than two alternatives.

Each agent has a preference relation over the set of

alternatives.

And we start with rational preference relations a compact consistent

transitive complete.

And we we allow we look at the, the you

know the the largest set of possible values.

So all preferences are there as long as they are

Russia.

And the social welfare function is a function from a

vector of preferences.

So preference relation for each individual to a social preference

on the same set.

It does require a lot so it requires a full

order.

Okay.

So the problem is quite in that it's quite restrictive.

Perhaps if we would, you know, only require the top

right.

What we really want to implement now that can weaken

that the weaker.

Moment to look.

So for this one function so that for any profile

of preferences it's in order for us.

Okay.

So what do we want.

I love this word Desiderata.

What what do we want from this aggregation rule.

So the requirement that the arrow put forward are the

following.

Um, first of all, as I said already, we don't

restrict this expression okay.

So we look at all possible.

It's very general, right?

It's very general.

The only requirement in Sinai we don't put any structure

on this.

Okay.

So it's not like, you know, something from left right

or no structure.

Okay.

Um, so no structural alternative and only structural.

Preferences is that.

They are rational.

A very reasonable requirement for an economist is to efficiency

in a very weak form.

So if all agents prefer outcome A to B, it

has to be that the social preference would be A

as ranked higher in the world.

Okay.

So that's very good.

The second requirement is.

Dictatorship.

What do we mean by dictatorship.

Imagine a person.

Uh, and think of this person.

As fixed.

And the preferences of all the other people could possibly

be changing.

Okay, so we look at, you know, me, plus you.

But, you know, maybe I can change you, or I

can change your preferences.

I would have been a dictator.

If no matter what preferences you have, my order would

essentially be the society.

My preference would be exactly the social preference.

Right?

That would be.

That would be the definition of a dictator.

Okay.

So sure, it could happen for one set of preferences.

The social preference mimics exactly mine.

But if it would happen no matter what the preferences

around me, then we would clearly say, okay, this person

is a is a dictator.

And that's a moral requirement here, is that we don't

want such and such a.

We don't want such, uh, a sorry social welfare function,

social choice function that would essentially Create an environment such

that, you know, no matter what other people want.

I always get it.

And the final requirement is that it's called independence of

irrelevant alternatives.

When you rank, when society ranks preferences between A and

B, it should take into consideration the individual preferences.

Only between and so other alternatives should not matter.

Right.

So the fact that individuals you know, some individuals prefer

A to C to B and some prefer A to

b to B and some.

So you look at the preferences of A, C and

d that should not affect your society's preferences between them.

Okay.

And arrows result.

There was impossibility.

Theorem says the following.

Uh.

There exists no social welfare function that satisfy Pareto efficiency,

universal admissibility, non dictatorship and independence of irrelevant and.

The populist way of describing this result is to say

if you want a social preference that satisfy satisfies Pareto

efficiency and, uh, independence of irrelevant axioms, then you have

to live in a dictatorship.

Okay.

So that's that's a proper thinking about this.

So if for any general function, for any social welfare

function that you think it would always violate the.

Of course.

Also remember the requirement that the social preference need to

be rational.

So majority rule is already ruled out.

So we knew that the outcomes would sometimes be anti

majoritarian right.

Because it would never be equal.

So some of the ranking would be an Italian.

But I was saying it's more than that if you

want also the other stuff you know for efficiency in

IEA it would all always be according to one purpose.

Okay.

It also means that one other way to think about

this is to think about, okay, if I know what

is a social welfare function and somehow, let's say I

know the preferences of others, I could always manipulate what

I said is my preferences have to get open.

It's another way to think about this and their sort

of theorems, uh, of strategic manipulation, of revealing your preferences

so that you can get what you want.

Okay.

So that's the starting point.

And that essentially tells us.

Um.

So from that point onwards, the literature took two direction,

one direction.

Uh, continue to follow arrow steps, arrows and steps and

to tinker and tweak the different, uh, requirements.

Okay.

And to think about, you know, different ways of formalising

what are the model requirement that we wanted.

So so my concern as one of the leaders on

that.

It has a really beautiful book on, on uh, trying

different, different, uh, moral, uh, Desiderata.

Uh, so it's a book with, with uh, each chapter

is divided into two.

One is more verbal.

And the second part is, is fully mathematical.

And, uh, it's a very nice and, and sort of

this branch of the literature continues to, to nowadays.

And there is an even now a connection with computer

science that are doing algorithmic social choice, trying to find.

Right.

So again, taking this problem from an engineering problem to

a degree, right.

Besides the question of what are the moral or what.

What what.

What does it mean?

Okay.

So we're not going to touch all this stuff.

The second, uh, strand that error created essentially the model,

because the idea was in modern political economy to say,

okay, this is very abstract.

Okay, this let's try and think, you know, how do

we actually think about society?

We don't think about very abstract preferences.

We don't think about all possible preferences.

You don't think about abstract options.

We have some institutional we have elections.

We have patients running for office.

Let's try this and see what we get to think

seriously about.

You know what's really behind this.

So it doesn't work.

It could work if you if you tweak some of

the some of the requirements here.

But.

You know.

Let's let's take it to somewhere the same way that

economics, you know, following a general equilibrium theory, we do

a lot of partial analysis.

We put some content into it.

Into it.

Okay.

So the next step is to say, it is to

say, you know, how can we you know, let's leave

that aside.

I mean, not not really.

Leave that aside.

Leave aside.

You know, the idea of finding something very general.

And see what we can play with.

We can play with the number of options, maybe, or

the type of options.

We can play with the preferences.

Maybe we put some structure on the preferences.

Right.

A lot of economics environment we put structure preferences welfare

theorems preferences okay.

Um and we can.

Play with some institutions that would sort of dictate the

types of options.

That is, is going to be.

The first attempt uh.

Supposed to add this institution and to say to the

to the basic majority what I described to you.

Right.

We had a winning against B, C winning against A,

B winning against the and again a win.

So when people looked at the world they said, look

actually, you know, you don't have this circle of stuff

and we have some sort of uh typically an agenda

setter if you think about legislation.

So we have some, you know, maybe the first stage

people vote between A and B, and then the winner

is pitted against, you know, which is the winner.

And we can see if if A is the winner

a split.

And then whatever happens.

So in this case you know a wins here and

then C wins here.

Right.

That would be C C won against it right.

That would be the outcome.

Um but as you could see of course.

And it's related to the initial problem.

If I would have changed the agenda.

right?

I would start between A, B and C, then we

would win right then and then between the B and

A and B okay.

So there is a lot of agenda power.

And even more than that, if you think about what

I described I just described people voting naively.

Right.

So we will vote in between A and B from

our preferences.

It was winning and then C was winning.

Hey, if I really hate C, okay.

For example, I'm the first voter.

That C was the last option for me.

Okay I the first voter that these were preferences okay.

So I really like a but I shouldn't vote for

a here.

I should make B win because then I know that

everything is okay.

So some people looked at the gender power.

Uh.

Again.

You know, part of the issue is that manipulation, right?

We shouldn't think about the voters as being sincere or

naive here.

They should think strategically.

And then.

Okay.

So that was sort of a one.

One detail from Social Choice that people have worked on

a bit, but not too much.

Okay, so the most successful direction went in this way.

We're going to.

We are going to limit the set of options.

You think about all the options is being ordered in

some.

Way.

Okay.

So let's just think about you know, order in which,

you know, options increase in size.

So think about the options between 0 and 1.

So now I have a precise set of options.

Okay.

Think about it.

It's finitely ordered.

Or maybe it's fine too.

And given this set of options, I'm also going to

limit the preferences that are allowed in a way that

is very palatable to people that think about politics.

What I'm going to think about is voters or widows

in society having preferences, which are single picks.

What does it mean?

I have some ideal policy, and whenever I go, the

further I go from this ideal policy, they were saying.

So the only structure that we put.

I mean, it's a lot of structure.

And so if I would describe some utility function doesn't

have to be continuous.

But the utility function is such that, you know, some

options give me the peak of my utility okay.

And there is only one peak.

So that so that my utility from other options.

You know.

Goes down in this direction like this.

Oh.

Okay.

The very simple result of leq.

Is as follows.

Okay.

So just formally, if theta is my ideal policy, if

option Y is less than, remember we can order them

okay.

If option Y is less than x which is less

than theta, then x is preferred to Y because it's

closer to my ideal policy.

And if option y is greater than x greater than

theta, also x is preferred y because it's closer to

my ideal.

Okay.

And black says.

The Condorcet winner exists.

Okay.

So before the Condorcet paradox, we couldn't find a winner.

Winner exist.

And it is.

Let's take all the ideal policies in society okay.

And let's take the median ideal policy.

So the theta the ideal policy of the media.

Who is the media?

The media is such that 50% of the people in

society have ideal policies to her left, and 6,050% of

people in society have ideas for.

Okay.

And this is the conduit.

So.

So actually we've simplified the general problem a lot.

So we set up a very particular set of options

a very particular set of preferences.

And we're just choosing one option.

The top option without creating is all.

Good.

If you want to do it in some way you

take this policy out.

And now the second point and so on.

Okay.

How do we know that the median ideal policy is

the killer?

We're going to pit it against any other policy.

And if it always wins, then we know for sure

that we don't have this cycle.

Right.

There is no way that we can decide.

Okay, so if this is the ideal policy of the

medium.

If you pit it against some policy X here.

Okay, we know that.

That.

For everyone that has ideal policies to the left of

the median right, including the median itself, they prefer the

theta m to.

X.

Right.

So it will be.

It will be the exception.

So we have 50% for sure that we didn't do

x.

And similarly for any policy x here we have everyone

with ideal policies to the right of the media that

prefers statements so very.

Very proof.

And.

I will put.

Some structure that, you know, you already see the, the

structure resembles sort of daily life or things that we

can see in the real world.

And we also are using the favourite mechanism of control.

Okay, so let's now take it a step further and

think, okay, we know in theory, if you do such

mechanisms that the aim would be all the time pitted

against other options, we can have a stable.

Okay.

But how actually does it happen in real life we

don't see somehow option two is putting this option.

How is it work?

Don't really see.

Right.

We don't really see something very abstract like this okay.

We know that this option potentially could win against all

others.

But how would these options be.

Developed.

Thank you.

Sorry.

We're going to that's exactly what we're going to.

So we're going have to think about an electronic computation

model.

Okay.

Put some structure on what happens.

And we're going to see.

If.

The electronic computation model is going to be okay.

And what are the assumptions.

Okay.

So just to remind us where we are, we started

with error.

And we simplified error to black.

That just gives us the sort of the quantum winner.

And now we're going to put some political structure.

Okay.

So that's the paper by Downes I think it was

1957.

Dance was inspired by telling ten B.C. location model firms.

Prince of diamonds thinks about okay, let me find an

Italian.

A sort of allocation model for politicians, right?

Makes it.

Okay, so here are the assumptions.

We're going to have two politicians.

They're going to simultaneously in a one, uh, one stage.

Okay.

They're going to offer platform.

You said.

So two politicians.

That means that just two options are going to be

offered to the voters.

At most.

Okay.

What do they want these politicians okay.

We have to specify a utility function.

Okay.

Let me assume.

So just that what the politician wants.

The politician wants to win.

So we typically call it office rents or ego rents.

What they want to do is win.

So you can think about this if I if you

want to fully specify utility function, if I'm winning the

election, I get one.

If I lose, I get zero.

If I win with some probability I do expected utility.

So uh, the probability that I will I get 12

plus probability I get you okay.

So the politicians of platforms maximise the probability of winning

given what the other country is offering.

Okay.

And then voters, they just have two options okay.

And we're going to use majority rule.

Okay.

It's probably the simplest, simplest political structure that.

You can think about, you know.

Which is it's good that we share something.

But we need more assumptions.

We need to use the black assumptions.

Right?

We need to use structure that actually the options that

they can offer.

So the platforms they can offer our audiences will perform

okay.

And the voters have single activities.

Right.

We want to implement this result from black.

So you can pick utility on one dimensional set.

Options.

So let's just think about the zero one.

Yeah.

Okay.

So let's highlight right?

I mean we have a candidate in mind which is

the median ideal policy okay.

So let's put it somewhere here.

And now we're looking for Nash equilibrium okay.

So we already have Nash 1951 okay.

So we're looking for Nash equilibrium.

Uh.

Okay.

So could it be an equilibrium that one politician offers

equality here and one politician offers a policy here.

So society is going to be split somehow between these

two okay.

if society is split.

So people that this policy.

So everyone here with ideal policies here for sure is

going to vote for this policy.

This one and the other way around here.

And then the people in the middle depends on where

exactly the utility okay.

If society is split so that one policy wins for

sure against the other.

Okay.

So I know that there is a majority, let's say,

for this policy okay.

Then it means that the other politician.

So this one is not best responding.

Because what do you want to do.

You want to win.

You can move in this direction.

In particular you can move to the policy of the

medium.

And you know you can.

So it cannot be it cannot be that one that

they offer two different policies and one of them win

solution.

Okay, okay.

Could it be that they offer different policies and each

of them wins with probability 0.5.

Right?

So that tie meaning that the median is exactly indifferent

between these two.

So now we're looking at a possible equilibrium in which

the policy is such that the median is indifferent to

society.

Split 5050.

Okay.

Again, what am I getting here is a politician, given

what this person is offering, and we're getting a utility

of 0.5 times my winning one, let's say okay.

But I can do better.

I can win with probability one.

Right.

Again, moving this direction.

Move to the ideal policy of the median eigenfunction.

Okay.

Which is what we've shown so far is that it's

not possible for them to offer two different voices.

Not again, not what we see in real life, but.

The model is clearly the price.

The politicians must converge.

And what do they converge to?

They must converge to that idea.

Why?

If we are both offering a policy which is not

the medium, again, I will use mobility point five.

I can do better.

I will use probability one.

I'm okay to converge to 96.

So that's the first proper model that we have an

electron computation, very clear, clean, uh, using like very, very,

very clear intuition okay.

Any questions about.

Okay.

So when we see a model like that we and

that's you know when we do the theoretical model you

do a lot of empirical stuff.

Also with Thorsten if you take the second half unit.

But I'm going to be focussed on theory.

So if you see a model like that you want

to start understanding the role of the different assumptions.

Okay.

And also maybe, you know, maybe question the result and

see what assumptions are the result set up.

Maybe align more with me.

I don't always see people.

I mean, of course the result is extreme.

We don't expect to see exactly this way in reality,

but a lot of times.

Okay, so let's think about the assumptions.

One first assumption that that, uh, people have questioned question,

question.

Uh.

Was this idea of, of his friends thinking that maybe

if if politicians are ideological and care about policy.

So in your utility function, you don't only want to

win, you also want you gain higher utility if you

implement something that is close to your own anyways.

Therefore these politicians that have some ideal policies, um.

Okay, so these were papers by Calvert.

And.

Whitman.

Two different things.

Um, okay.

So let's think about that.

Let's give them some utility function.

Okay.

Let's say that the politicians, uh, so they have the

idea for this data AI and the utility increases the

closer.

Right.

We have a single peak.

So theta is the peak of the politician politician either

to politician and theta star is the winning policy okay.

So this is a quadratic loss preference right.

Uh that depends on your ideal policy and on the

implemented policy.

Okay.

It's just simple symmetric single fixed activity.

So if you move away from your ideal policy if

this is data I.

Said.

Okay.

Your utility is negative and it's symmetric in the two

distances.

It doesn't have to be symmetric for the purpose that

we are just giving you a simple simple.

Picture.

Okay.

So your pick is here.

You get utility zero and you suffer losses.

Okay.

This is just something for creep to think.

And what's the intuition?

The intuition is actually if I really care about the

policy I want to push the winning policy in my

direction.

Right.

So let's repeat the exercise that we did before.

Okay.

Let's repeat the exercise.

Before I think about.

Think about whether we can have polarisation in the divergence.

Okay.

So let's think about these two policies that I looked

at before.

Okay.

This is for condition one.

This is two.

Uh let's even make them very extreme.

So that just, just for just for the sake of

argument, it doesn't matter.

Okay.

So let's say politician two ideal policy is really the

extreme option on the right.

And also let's call the left right politician the leftist

politician very extreme.

So that should encourage more and more polarisation.

Okay.

So let's say let's ask ourselves if this can be

in the room.

Um, let's repeat the same exercise.

Could it be an equilibrium in which, uh, the right

wing politician wins for sure.

If the right wing politician wins, for sure.

The left wing politician gets utility from this policy, right?

Because she's losing.

So her utility would be the utility that she gets

on this policy.

Any other policy here would be better for her.

Right?

So for sure, any movement in the direction in particular

to the media, she knows she beats this policy.

Okay.

And then she gets a higher utility because this policy

is closer to.

Okay.

So we cannot diverge with one policy function.

Okay.

Clear.

Okay.

What's next?

Let's do the 5050.

Yeah.

So let's assume now that these two policies I don't

want to define new ones.

These policies are such that the median is different.

So what am I getting this partition.

I know, that, uh, with probability 0.5.

This is going to be the policy.

So 5050, we assume.

Yeah.

Think about this as probability 0.5.

The left is elected.

By the right.

Okay.

So with probability 0.5 I'm getting this.

Let's say I'm left okay with 4.5.

So I'm getting a lottery over something which is closer

to it and over something which is quite far away.

Okay.

What can I do?

Okay.

Even without risk preferences, I describe it even without recursion.

You could move a tiny bit.

Okay.

Really tiny bit.

Win for sure.

Why?

How do I know that?

You could win for sure.

Well, the median was indifferent before.

Now you're moving towards.

You can win for sure.

And with a policy that is only marginally worse than

your best policy.

So even though our intuition and the basic intuition of

everyone that tried that was that ideological preferences would create

the divergence.

The median voter result is so strong that adding ideology

ideology here is meaningless.

I mean, only kicks in if you win.

So your motivation to win is so strong that we

still get.

To the median.

If the cost function is not like quadratic, but it's

like the penalty is larger.

Yeah, but in the market if they win the competition

you make that work.

It's still the case that you know.

I mean.

A small given that there is a difference between the

policy, which is 50/50 with the infinitesimally small movements I

can guarantee with for sure, with this policy is all

almost the same as what I would want before.

So as long as I rank the two policies in

a different way.

I don't have the sensitivity between the two policies.

So.

If you start at the baseline.

If I like risk, if I like risk.

Uh.

No, I still think there is a dominant, dominant market.

I'm not comparing that to the certainty equivalent, but during

that.

I think this rests on.

Does it rest on the politicians?

I think it is.

Uh.

I think I think I.

Think it does.

A pretty stupid example, right?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

If I if.

Yeah, of course, you know.

Well.

So your left has is decreasing and then right has

decreased decreasing that like they also have exactly the same

used to the far right.

That the difference between the left policy and the right.

So if for some reason they have these utilities.

Right.

And this is my topic.

Yes.

Good.

Okay.

So how can we get polarisation divergence.

So within this ETA with this size within this ETA.

We need the ideology ideological motive and another assumption okay.

The other assumption that we need is.

That the politicians are not sure about the meeting.

They're not sure whether it means something about society.

The politicians are facing uncertainty about the diffusion of preferences

in society.

And, you know, maybe the media could be anywhere.

What they have in mind is maybe a medium of

mediums.

Okay.

So they can have an expected media.

So they did something on and I don't have ideology.

I don't have ideology.

Okay.

So let's be let's be clear.

You made assumptions for polarisation.

Or you need ideology plus uncertainty on where the politicians

are.

If you don't have the ideology but you're not sure

where the where the median is.

Your best bet about where the media you know what

to do is go to the median of the median.

Okay, now just data.

In fact, I'd say the median of the median.

Okay.

I only care about winning.

So I just want to go through this.

So it's the same argument.

Okay.

But now let's think about, you know, ideology plus uncertainty.

And let's ask ourselves can they be.

It's like the opposite argument.

Can they be converging on the median.

So that what happens with probability one.

I'm getting this okay.

But if I deviate slightly with some probability I'm still

getting this because the other politicians, and with some probability

I'm getting something closer to my voice.

All right, so what's the meaning of the meeting?

Well, the distributions.

You can think about.

Uh, you're drawing the median from some distribution okay.

And in expectations, looking at ex-ante point of view and

thinking about all the possible.

Uh.

Distributions, the median of the median tells me the expectation

50%.

Just computing the points.

Such that, okay, averaging over all distribution according to my

prior.

So they need to have a prior.

They need to have the same prior.

Then I can figure out.

More generally with ideology and uncertainty, even forget about it.

At any point we cannot converge because I have a

dominant strategy.

I don't know.

So whatever you're doing is the other politician, I'm better

better off.

Moving slightly towards the deviation is such that, not the

equilibrium deviation is such that I can slightly.

There is a probability, strictly positive probability that it will.

Okay.

And I'm moving towards my.

You're already offering this.

What's the point of me offering the same I.

Promise I can increase my utility in some.

Way.

It's like a weekly dominance.

Yeah.

So this is the 50% or something.

50% or this situation.

Yeah.

So the equilibrium itself, we didn't solve this.

We have to balance.

Right.

So we know that the politicians would diverge.

They would have to balance.

I mean, there's going to be a first order condition.

So we can't solve, you know, just by drawing the

first order conditions such that if I move there to

the right, I'm losing everything.

Um, so given what the other is doing, we have

to believe in.

The larger certainty, the more.

We have to quantify.

What we mean by larger than.

What we call variance in where the median is.

I will allow myself to diverge toward my idea, but.

Also, I think I.

Implicitly thought about the ideal conditions, you know, as to

the right and to the left of this stream or

around the median or.

So sorry I missed the black hole.

Yeah, yeah, because that went out.

Because we restricted preferences to a cardinal utility.

It's it's it doesn't matter.

Is it?

Or is it.

Oh, no.

It's just.

Just thinking.

About that that we also the IEA as well we

restricted to one dimension.

We restricted to one.

So I guess I guess yeah.

It's it seems to have the same, the opposite have

the same belief of the uncertainty.

Yes, yes.

So.

Like they if.

They don't have the same belief then given the option,

you know, I mean we have to think about something.

If I get the signal.

Each of us gets a signal.

But it's not the same for.

Each of us gets a signal about the distribution of

preferences.

Okay.

Then in equilibrium, given where you are located, I would

learn some information about your signal.

Right.

So the location of each of us would take into

consideration my signal and what I've learned.

So it's a.

Much more complicated problem.

With.

The.

Cost again divergence because I don't know if it should

be even larger and I don't know exactly what.

So I'm allowing myself to.

There are other assumptions here that we could change, right?

Uh, you know, why do politicians.

Okay.

Uh, there may be entry, either of politicians or even

why do these two politicians want to.

So talk later on, uh, when we think also about

multi-dimensional policy space.

I talk about keeping this for later.

Another assumption is that the.

As voters, as people, I'm sure I hope you voted

in your life.

Uh, surely don't always think the campaign promises implementation as

being something that would improve.

be satisfied?

I'm sure.

In this model, the politicians have full commit.

Okay?

Whatever they offer to the to the voters.

The voters think that this will be implemented.

This is a very strong assumption.

It allows them to do whatever they want.

Right.

All these deviations were allowed because.

Because coming to a right.

To a degree it fits together with the office.

Right.

That's right.

Because if I'm if I just care about winning, why

shouldn't I?

It's not a big thing.

Actually, there is some game in the background and thinking

about the election idea properly to do it.

But if we think about ideological politicians.

Okay, or.

We'll talk later on.

But that could be swayed by interest groups.

So, you know, maybe if I think they have some

preferences, some stuff that they want to implement, either their

intrinsic preference or something that they would like to do,

then I'm probably not thinking that they can implement.

So again, I'll talk about this later on today.

A model that thinks about both entry and issue of

commitment.

So okay, so this would come this would come later.

Um, of course these models were being used also to

check other types of, of, uh, rules.

You know, when you extend to more than two politicians,

think about proof of voting.

You can think about a lot of stuff, but also

you get into the problem of what to you think

about both?

Imagine somehow the three politicians and.

Okay.

And they offer these platforms.

Voters could naively believe in the sense, in the following

sense that they do not take strategic consideration into the

decision to vote.

Okay, the naive or sometimes we call them sincere.

They vote for the option that they like most is

regarding the equilibrium behaviour of other people.

Think about.

That sense, the naive sense here.

Which in many elections if you know we will talk

also later.

Of course.

Why do we vote in the first place.

We are not affecting the result, right?

Okay.

Zero.

Okay.

So naive.

Let's say people just look at let's say that the

roughly all these people vote for this.

Okay, so once you have more than two politicians, no

more than two politicians that offer model two platforms, you

know, naive voters could vote in this way.

And strategic voters, you know, could potentially coalesce around two.

Right.

We think okay, with which are the ones that are

most likely like we did with the agenda setting relationship,

for which of the two options are the most likely,

uh, will let me vote for the one that I

prefer.

Uh, the networks are more right.

So if I'm thinking, for example, that, you know, somehow

we all coordinate on just voting for one and three,

okay?

And then I decide which one I prefer.

So that will happen in an equilibrium with strategic voters.

And then politicians have to take this into consideration.

All right.

So once we have more than two politicians, right?

If with just two options, they even rational behaviour is

exactly the same, right?

We don't have to vote for the option that once

we have more than two options, then we get into

this question, which is an empirical question.

In some elections we have some tactical voting.

How does exactly do that?

In my case, though, that's that's not an equilibrium point.

We can define what people want in this case.

If the politicians again.

You know I could think about politician three.

So now we go back to the politicians, for example,

and ask ourselves this.

If the expected outcome, if I'm not affecting the result

or, or if I'm losing for sure, maybe I want

to drop out of the race, or maybe I want

to offer something else, even if I have commitment or

not.

Again if the expected outcome falls here.

Even if I win with some probability, let's say one

third, one third, one third if the expected outcome falls

here.

Maybe also I want to draw from the right.

So again to depend on official ideology make good.

Uh.

Okay.

So the model that looks at, uh, no commitment and

entry and comparison is called decision candidate.

I will get to that even though I said it's

ABCd and we've done ABCd.

It's not the end.

Okay.

Um.

Okay.

So we looked at all the assumptions, but also looking

at the the key result, which is convergence versus the

that has been uh.

That's been a big thing in the economy to understand

what generally what what politicians are offering.

Uh, there are also measure issues what is good for

the voters.

I mean, on one hand, the median voter seems a

sort of a good focal moral point that we would

like politicians to offer.

But sometimes maybe there is also an argument that voters

need choice, uh, certainty.

So they're more the models in which, you know, actually,

polarisation is good for the voters.

If the reason.

That that, uh, that has been a convergence of the

voting machine that.

Again, the focus should be on divergence to look.

At.

Whether it's mostly for political scientists.

This machine.

Okay, so this is supposed to be a three hours

lecture.

So it would be good if we think, you know,

take a break in the middle rather than two breaks.

So we have 20 minute break.

Break.

So they have a dialogue and uncertainty.

The outcome is going to be I'm going to state

my preferred policy.

Right.

No no no you have to buy the.

Policies that way with a higher probability than just this

model.

So this.

Is going to result.

In outcome.

Balanced distribution.

But it doesn't exactly move closer to the.

Just a few of you.

Are you getting to me?

You know for sure that.

They're.

Going to reach out to us.

Good.

Okay.

Yeah.

You know.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

No.

I want to show you.

Yeah.

See you.

Jeff.

Yes.

Thank you.

Sir.

All right.

Oh, yeah.

Sorry.

Excuse me.

Sorry.

Yeah.

That's true.

That's true.

He saw me this morning.

I wasn't sure what.

Exactly.

It's about.

I think it's great.

I think it's like this.

Like they don't want.

To give you some scholarships, I think.

How is everything going with.

Your third class?

Yeah, yeah.

I am upgrading.

What not to say to a comic theorist.

Sorry.

What do you want from the masters?

So I also do a program.

Like.

I started.

Yeah.

So first year, I think, like, I'm good at it.

So this is a very It just gets so confusing.

But we just got in like five years.

So I'll just say I'm sorry for studying to.

Be truthful.

But can you show some of those in the class?

Right.

Oh, it's a different it's kind of like simple, right?

I like this one right here.

I just I just don't go, so.

You know.

Oh, you are the same as you are thinking, like,

doing something like that.

Yeah, I was wrong like that.

Oh, okay.

So what did you ask?

So is something about, life.

I try to see, like the way we kind of

framing the question or like changing the question, kind of

like kind of the big update method.

So that's my thing.

Well, I will say, as I say, I know economics

is broader, right?

That's exactly the way.

I also thought in the later part I'm going to

put like, yeah, you.

Kind of have some ideology with it because I believe

in the very rational way.

I think always all the information is a lot of

different variables.

So we have all these differences and all the other

things.

So those kind of things you're listening to.

Yeah.

So originally I thought, this is like the way this

handled.

But how do people process it when they receive the

information for it?

Oh yes, I remember there's a time.

And how do they process it?

One to analyse.

How do they update.

Doing that versus is that the way of the way

to elicit the kind of knowledge that the use of

the method and to change the experience.

But I think so how would you.

Well you just.

Yeah.

I was thinking, how do we really think that these

two different questions.

Right.

Or us like, oh, imagine that your friends or something.

So, so I use a very neutral environment, like, you

know, like the bottom of the bowl, like, you know

how the experience of this is like.

Yeah.

I used to like that.

Huh?

So, uh, what do you think?

What is that?

I mean, if you are like a patient, you're thinking

about, like, the probability that the box has been selected,

and then you think about like, okay, so what's the

next ball?

Yeah.

But if I ask them directly, like.

Yeah.

Just like, really follow the baseball and just think about

like maybe there are like frequencies.

Just look at.

Other methods.

What do you think about if I ask the question,

is there anything that you could say to you in

the wrong direction is what is wrong like?

I mean, right, like if I use a the vibration

I see, I see, I get the right one.

But if I kind of complicate it.

Based on the way I ask them to do the

motivation.

So maybe the reason is trying to try to simplify.

So you kind of idea how you use your base.

So you have a set.

Yeah.

The way they change and like the projector like it's

just like this base on the board.

So I can not use the word family for example.

And then there is saying, you know, like changing the

light.

You can.

See it in my room.

Let's say you.

End up going to use it right now.

Maybe like this is like a frame friend.

Like, if you tell me you have one second to

decide.

What?

One second you decide that, you tell me your answer

versus you tell me you have.

So then.

I give you one second.

I mean, I was just thinking, like, some other time.

Anyway, I'm just thinking like this.

Yeah, I think.

So.

So, like I said, so I kind of, like, hold

down the right way.

So people.

Should know that I don't know, I don't really know.

I mean, like.

And because of that secret also, you have to go

fast.

Yes, but you don't know.

What else could be hours, you know, like.

So one is more likely one thing.

I went away from behaviour that it does not like,

you know.

And like I can, like, I like I did not

think like seven years.

Ago I know, like.

I like a lot of locations.

For what I like.

But in any case, it's not like I was really.

High school.

Right?

So how does that affect our decisions?

It's a whole industry.

Yeah, well, it looks good, but I also think it's

a little more subtle.

Plus that's great.

But like the first one, I'm thinking.

Yeah, because I'm just.

I'm just thinking about this.

Right now I have two experiments.

One is selection and one is about technology for me

in Romania.

So we we gave this is what the world.

But basically we have to give like up to $100,000

for the technology.

So there will be this answer is we're going to

measure technology.

But but we want to think something more interesting than

that.

That's what we're working on now.

Something more about the market stuff like again and again

and again like.

it's not like, how do you get the money?

Well, I guess what my problem so is because it's

it's a world Bank problem.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

No, no, no, my project is about like the something.

So yeah, I can just try to sell them.

Yeah.

Because I'm not basically the people that the, the respondent.

I mean it's merely it would help, you know.

Wow.

That's great.

You know it's huge.

There's some money but it doesn't.

But that's already happening.

So I don't know how good is going to go.

But we're trying to find interest.

That's my job right.

In a way.

Like for like sales instead of hobbies.

So we're thinking something like they would think like, how

can I think more about consumers?

Like, I think there's something interesting there.

I'm not sure what I was trying to think about,

but you already do that.

I mean, I do, I agree, but, you know, things

can wait.

I'm still waiting because, like, the program is happening right

now.

Oh, you take this one.

So right now I do a lot of reports.

And analysis.

Yeah.

But I was thinking, like, I could try, like I

am, I can just go.

Yeah I know.

But but but I agree.

Like if, if I don't have time because I have

other things I have to watch.

You didn't interview me.

But you know what it's.

Like to come to this movie.

And, you know, I never know when someone.

And.

I know.

Yeah, some people just joined together, but they're all murdered

by police.

Yeah.

There are so many stories.

Yeah.

Uh, someone should just leave a.

Message.

I don't think so.

Don't go down those.

Things.

Go.

Down to the basement.

That's a lot.

So it's good.

That it's directly related to, like.

Programming.

And.

Stuff.

There's some uncertainty in the number of people like each

people.

So.

Basically it is very complicated.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Because you said like it goes in two stages, right?

Yeah, yeah.

But it's not like that.

So you're gonna make two people basically targeting another program.

It's just a program that's probably.

About.

All time.

Yeah.

Oh, okay.

Yeah.

Thank god.

I think it's cool.

I mean, it's very interesting.

Yeah, it must be quite.

I don't like it.

I don't want you to think anything involving this high

risk and then going inside and.

Expecting a very specific.

Extreme one.

And then it gets really like it's not.

Even people.

Right.

It's really tight.

Yeah.

There is more evidence to come on the subject of

that.

Yeah.

So it's back through here?

Yeah.

I mean, you can just set up based on random.

People like quite a lot of people.

Like, it seems to be like.

It's kind of like going to a museum and basically,

you know, you cannot use like a, like outside or

like you cannot open or not.

But.

Many people, probably because it is basically for free.

Those people that are here, maybe.

Good for you.

I don't know.

I actually like to talk about things because I have

something.

I don't know.

Do you have, like, a just like.

Yes, I have like this.

So.

I'm also like asking if you have.

Enough of an idea if you want to go with

it.

Yeah.

Right.

Right.

So.

Yeah.

So I want something that is something that could be

like.

I think it's like sometimes you're only.

Because they see you next year.

Oh.

Sure.

Well.

You know, I never thought that I could.

It seems that eventually.

I was going to.

But then I followed that idea to, like Daniel, like,

and said to me.

Okay, that.

Makes it to the finish line.

You know, you should do.

This.

You.

Do that.

I think I will go through tonight.

So I did two things.

A lot of internet shopping.

Right?

Yeah, I'll be fine.

But I will talk to the development guys.

Besides, maybe because.

I find it.

I don't know what it is.

I have many.

Questions.

Yeah.

Like all together, they don't really have to make each

other.

Uh, so you basically, you know, if you communicate.

You can, you know.

You can.

Write.

Several things.

You.

Just have.

I don't.

Like it.

That is why it's like I have nothing else to

say.

That would be cool.

Then suddenly.

New ideas become a.

Kind of second.

I thought.

Maybe.

Maybe try to.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I think I can.

I think I like you.

Somewhat.

Anyway.

Did you.

do.

Okay.

So.

You know.

In public, it's all different.

Do you think, like, you know.

Yeah.

Like I got it.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah, I can get.

Any I like.

It's just.

Yeah.

Yeah, I agree it doesn't.

Really?

Happen.

Nothing.

Anything.

Okay.

Um.

So we started with the situation.

Result.

We have the possibility.

Result in a very restrictive environment.

But then we try to actually implement in the real

world, uh, we're still far away from the centre, but

we're still a bit further from the real world in

the sense of asking ourselves, what are these policies, right?

I mean, if we want to actually check, if we

want to actually check, uh, any sort of.

You know, economic implications, uh, compared.

You know, check the data, whether we see these policies

and so on.

We're still we're still far away.

So the next step I'm going to do is to

sort of look at a model that tries to take

something which is roughly the structure and give us some,

uh, prediction about rather.

Than a question about, uh, yeah.

So if we extend that to two dimensions.

But, uh.

Let me talk.

About.

And then right below what I'm going to talk about

may not be what you're thinking, but okay.

It's a huge I mean I will talk about this.

So you've seen it is more than one dimensional.

Okay, cool.

Um.

Slow down to discuss this.

There is something which is similar to black that I

just want to mention.

Uh, it's by Robert in 1977.

Kevin.

Robert.

He was at LSC when he wrote this, and then

Oxford, and now it's just retired.

Um, instead of thinking about the single big preferences, we

are thinking about single crossing property.

Okay.

So we're still ordering options.

Think about this from left to right.

So increasing in some metric.

And.

We are saying if I is greater than J on

this metric okay.

And option x is greater than option y.

For example if I is, uh, poorer.

Okay, that's a bit confusing.

If I is poorer than J and X is a

higher tax rate than one.

That's something to think about.

Okay.

If I prefer to the one that is higher, or

if I prefer the lower option, then I definitely should

prefer the low end option.

If the poor person prefers the lower tax rate, then

the richer person should be referred to.

Okay, if you think the poor is not great, that's

the single crossing property.

So but you can see how it's related to the

single fixed.

Right.

If somebody more on the left prefers, uh, a right

wing option to the left one.

Definitely something more.

Under the single crossing property.

Again, the winner would be the median voter's ideal policy.

And I repeat this, I.

I just bringing this forward because the next paper that

applies these ideas to economic models uses property results rather

than rather than okay.

Okay.

So this is a very famous paper by Milton Region.

This is 1985.

Uh, it's actually surprising that only in 1995, whereas a

paper that sort of gives us a prediction of whether

we're going to have a positive or negative tax rate.

The paper has no political structure besides the median voter

to characterise what are Dominion voting preferences.

So the paper relies on all this to say the

political outcome will be the median voter without getting into

political structural prohibitions on political outcomes.

So the only issue is, you know, who is the

median and what are the preferences.

Starting not from some abstract preferences okay.

Absolute preferences on taxes, but starting from basic elements that

we think about in economic models like productivity.

Okay.

So what people differ in is not abstract ideal policies

but productivity okay.

The tax system is, you know, t is the linear

tax that we're going to employ.

And capital T is the level of redistribution.

The preferences of citizens.

So first of all my utility is such that the

utility Directly from disposable income.

So this is the level of redistribution that I'm getting,

plus whatever is left for my income.

What is my income?

It's my productivity times the number of hours that I

work.

Okay.

So n is the number of hours that I'm working.

I will choose this optimally.

Okay.

So we have proper economy in this paper and the

productivity and people will choose labour.

Uh, the amount of labour that they're exerting.

Okay.

Taking into consideration the, the tax level and their own

productivity.

So their indirect utility function is based on the political

decision tax system.

Okay.

It looks like two dimensions.

But it's not because every all the tax revenues are

redistributed back.

Okay.

So whatever t low t middle T is not cheap

to capita is determined by taking into consideration the average

income which will be defined.

So mu is the average income.

So your indirect utility is a function of your productivity

and the tax rate because directly you're choosing your optimal

labour level okay.

And then um so this is L is going to

be an endogenous and endogenous okay.

So that's a yes.

Sorry.

So the practice match on the right hand side.

Then we'll see what we maximise okay.

We need another.

Bracket.

Yeah.

Right.

So maximising or we don't need a bracket here.

I'm maximising my utility which depends on two elements utility

income come and do.

This you do that.

Okay.

So we can define the optimal level of labour which

depends on alpha and the tax system okay.

And then your income is going to be for any

alpha it's going to be alpha times L star okay.

So.

You can see that we have the indirect utility function.

Everything is going to be the function of alpha and

the taxes okay.

What they are using is a an applied result in

robots.

So robot is the one that actually showed that within

this economic model the single crossing condition holds if income

increases enough.

Okay.

So we started with individuals and differ in the productivity.

And we see that the higher is the productivity, the

higher is become.

It could have been different right.

Sometimes.

So so they did.

The right one.

If the higher is the productivity the higher is the

income.

We also have the single crossing condition a lot on

how different productivity stress different taxes.

So if you have a higher productivity and you prefer

a higher tax, definitely a person with a lower productivity

will also prefer the higher.

Okay.

And this comes this arises if if income also increases

productivity.

We know that sometimes income does not necessarily activity depending

on your activity conditions.

With income increases in productivity.

It's also the case that we have the single crossing

condition and then we can use the median.

So this is how literature develops.

You know some papers show that, you know, median filter

can work.

And then other papers just take it for granted and

just say, okay, now we use.

Okay.

So we're going to assume that the utilities are such

that you can increase the activity.

We can figure out what is the average income.

Right.

It's just that the next expression is an expression for

the average income.

We know how to tie together.

Uh, so the average income is a function of the

tax system.

So now we have the condition of the budget balanced

for the government.

You know, everything is spent back on redistribution.

Okay.

And now we can figure out what is the ideal

tax for the medium.

Right.

So we are now maximising the indirect utility function over,

uh, t, which also determines the redistribution level given the

productivity of the medium.

Okay.

So we we've used all these steps in the way

that we have, you know, we have established a single

crossing condition.

Also we know it's the medium and that's what we're

looking at.

So now it's just a basic first order condition of

the indirect utility of the medium.

So the indirect utility you know the tax is going

to be here.

Okay.

So this is going to be why.

Because of the media.

And this is going to be written three times mu.

So if you take the derivative of you respect to

the first element with respect to t, you get y

minus mu with respect to the second element you don't

need to take because of the envelope theorem were already

the maximum right where we are looking at the negative

function.

Okay.

So we have the derivative with respect to the first

element.

Here is u minus y that I promised before okay.

Plus there may be effect of the on.

There is an effect of the on on me.

Okay.

And this is the result which led to huge literature

afterwards.

What is the result?

The result says the tax.

The society will choose the tax according to the medium

it's going to be.

So this is assuming that taxes are not to distortion

of the.

Tax according to the median, is such that if the

median income is less than the mean income, there will

be positive taxation.

If the median income is higher than the average income

would.

Be negative.

Or not.

Okay.

So very basic intuitive right?

I mean, you know, your the direct effect on your

utility is that tax takes away your income and gives

you something in to order of the average.

So what is the meaning?

Which is sort of how we would think about less

equal society.

So I think it's not fully accurate now because we

have this denominator effect here, but some imprecise terms, the

more unequal in society, we should expect that to be

higher.

Definitely just about this discreetly unequal societies should have taxation

equal societies.

And they have subsidies.

You can think about this is just let's say let's

let's fix it at zero.

So like.

Oh.

Okay.

So here we use the single crossing which is like

single peaked.

And we reached the conclusion that, you know uh, inequality.

Leads to taxation particular inequality in the form of median

method.

So we forgot here all the other stuff that tells

us that with other assumptions and that if you don't

get the median I mean, the median is strong result.

But no, we're not looking at all the tweaks that

we did to the model and say sometimes there is

polarisation.

We are using sort of a strong focus result of

the median and we reach an empirical prediction.

Okay.

And this created a huge literature because this empirical prediction

actually is not.

It has a very mixed appearance.

Okay.

Typically the big comparisons between U.S. and Europe, uh, US,

is all unequal.

I mean, it's also more unequal because the taxes are

lower but unequal and taxes are lower, whereas most European

countries and even within Europe you have higher education countries.

What creates work?

So this feeds into an even in countries in which

there is taxation, higher taxation.

Still it is.

Uh, it is it is not perceived as high as

a lot of our models.

Okay.

So there is a big sort of question of, uh,

a more, maybe a more crude question of why don't

the poor expropriate rich poor of our numerous.

Okay.

And, uh.

The analogue of this question on the other side is,

why do the rich agree to live in a democracy

in which they know that some taxation, they would have

to face exemption?

Maybe they don't want the.

So a lot of what we would think about in

this course is actually reasonable question.

Okay.

Because when you think about economic outcomes?

What do we really think about?

Most of the time, some form of regulation can be

right.

And what are the economic outcomes of political systems?

The general economic distribution distribution would be a good solution.

Um.

You know, there are a lot of decisions in the

political system that seem to be more cultural or more

free of.

Liberal, uh, human rights and so on.

But they also have a lot of effect on the

ability to the work force is gaining, uh, you know,

some part of the population cannot go to work, uh,

or cannot attain the jobs that other people can attain.

So it's like so.

So it's a lot about redistribution of, you know, it

could be about economic power, labour bargaining power and so

on.

Essentially, we will capture this by thinking about by thinking

about redistribution.

So there is mixed empirical support.

And if you look generally in the studies, many countries

together.

So observations for example, are that, uh, separately from 96

little evidence of negative relation between quality and fixation.

So it doesn't really explain cross country differences.

And it doesn't come out when you pull all the

countries together.

It doesn't say, for example, you don't see big difference

between democracies and non democracies in the tax rates.

Uh and the relation to quality.

Although if you look at if you separate democracies for

being less diverse and more diverse or stuff like that,

the less diverse Democracies do have typically higher tax rates.

General taxation.

So.

What could there be?

You know what could be explanations of why?

Of the complicated relations between income inequality and taxation.

Uh, it could come from the political system itself.

Okay.

So next time we will talk about what's next time

in ICU.

We will talk about schools.

Uh, and we would also talk about thinking of more

than one dimension of conflict, how these play together.

So we think, you know, most of the explanations that

we think about go back to, to some sort of

institutions, either interest groups or how parties combine different dimensions

and, and create sort of compromises that sometimes may result

in lower and lower expression.

So most of the explanation would be fusion.

Okay.

But given that this is sort of an introduction, I

do want to do a, you know, even larger detour,

uh, to mention an explanation that relates to sort of

the culture.

Of the culture in.

Okay.

So again, the question that we're asking, you know, why

is this, this obfuscation between income inequality, taxation, especially the

continental divide between US and Europe?

Um, and some people mentioned this idea that attitudes towards

redistribution play a big role in politics, attitudes, beliefs.

Uh, if you think, for example, that it's all about

luck then.

And that's why we have different activities and different incomes,

then you might be more receptive, receptive to the idea

of succession.

Okay, maybe I'm lucky, but.

It's not going to be as lucky.

Um, I do tax.

Uh, but if you think it's all about hard work.

You know, want to maintain the gains that they make

So when they were working hard.

And so it might be that these beliefs account for

some countries.

Which could either mean that maybe the fundamentals are different

across countries, or maybe people in some countries have their

own needs.

So I just want to skim through to them sort

of skimming through.

Um, in general, what I'm going to do is not

more than two papers per lecture could involve one that

is more theoretical and one is more inclined.

That's my talk to them.

Okay.

So I want to mention the paper of Piketty.

This was actually a drama series before he started writing.

This is not.

important data.

Um.

So it has a model in which people are learning

through time.

About the role of luck versus the role of heart.

Okay.

So when you think about people, think about dynasties okay.

So I have, you know, my own dynasty.

I might have learned something from my parents.

And I will transfer some things to my kids, and

I will update throughout my lifetime and then and so

on.

Given these beliefs, I'm going to choose how hard I'm

going to work, because if I'm thinking that it's mostly

luck, I shouldn't work.

Not work.

Okay, so this is the element of hard work.

And the luck element is some shocks to income.

Okay.

So I'm choosing how much to work I'll show you

the precise income function.

So I'm choosing how much to work I know how

much I'm working but I don't know.

You know, what's the effect of work on my income

and what's the effect of luck?

So there is two dimensional uncertainty.

Then I get my income.

So for my income, given that I know my effort,

I can update jointly on the effect of work and

effectively I update my belief.

I transfer them to my children.

And then I also mentioned to do something else before

I die, I vote on the text.

Okay so here are the specific utilities.

Before tax my income will be the function of.

So I'm dynasty I is a function of or individual

I.

It's a function of uh luck which is fine okay.

So I'm drawing you know so so this lack of

parameters are going to be the same for the whole

population when we think about the fact that.

Uh.

They're the same in the sense of the distribution.

But of course I may draw low income or high

income, depending on my luck today.

Plus theta I times e.

So theta I is the effect of effort on my

income.

Here is my effort.

So there is cost of effort.

And benefit of effort to theta.

Okay.

So again the indirect utility is a function of the

tax.

We have again the simple tax system everything is remunerated

back with general distribution.

So my income is one minus t times y which

is a function of e minus the cost of effort.

So I'm choosing E to maximise this utility function.

And then there is a simple condition on the level

of effort which effort increases.

The higher is the higher I think that the effort

is effective, the more I think that effort is effective.

And of course it decreases.

Okay.

So that's pretty straightforward.

Okay.

So my beliefs over time evolve over these two parameters.

Pi I think he assumes just the binary level for

very low or high and theta.

Okay.

It could be anything.

Okay.

And again we're going to use the median outcome.

So at any period voting is taxation is determined by

the median preferences.

So again we would see the taxes are higher if

the belief that theta is if beliefs are such that

theta is low right.

Think about the median.

If the median thinks that the theta is low, then

it's the luck that plays a big role.

Uh, and then.

I want to choose if you want to have redistribution.

Also if the difference in the price is high.

And as before, if your distance from the meaning.

What is, uh, on one hand complicated?

On the other hand.

Interesting here.

My beliefs are going to depend on my endogenous action.

Okay.

So if I have some belief, for example, that, uh,

that is very low, I'm going to exert low effort.

Okay.

I'm going to exert no effort.

And the income that I see, I will update based

on this lower.

I will update my beliefs based on this lower.

Okay.

If, on the other hand, for some reason I was

choosing high effort, then my beliefs would have been updated

in addition to I given the same income.

Of course the distribution of income is change, but if

this process would be different.

So beliefs determine the level of effort.

Which then of course resulted in various taxation and so

on.

Effort determines the level of beliefs.

So beliefs and effort evolving.

Okay.

Two key assumptions.

Such a model in which you know you have infinite

horizon.

Individuals here choose effort myopic.

So they just focus on this period in which they

are alive and choose their effort.

They don't care about.

Manipulating the level of effort so that future generations can

learn.

Okay.

So even though when they choose taxes, they as if

they maximise their utilities, but they don't experiment.

They're not saying, okay, let me choose a very high

level of effort so that I can learn all of

them, or choose zero level of effort so that I

can learn time effectively.

They don't, they don't.

They just choose this.

Well, their second assumption that is more debateable is that

you only observe your own dynasty, so you don't observe

the people.

There are some choices.

Okay, so it's as if we look at each dynasty

separately.

Uh.

Why is that?

If we would observe everyone and there would be, you

know, different beliefs in society to start with, we will

learn.

A lot of information, a lot of different effort decisions.

Okay.

And then what it does here is sort of blocks

learning in some way.

Books learning in some way so that you know the

videos can search, they can learn different things in society.

And second, they will not necessarily.

The truth.

Is.

Potentially possible to learn the truth, but not necessarily.

Okay.

Um.

One technical element is that beliefs are a martingale process,

meaning that your, you know, mu is the just the

two dimensional beliefs that you are updating on.

So your expected beliefs that the next period equals your

beliefs now.

So you don't expect to know more given what you

know, okay.

It implies that beliefs must converge in the limit.

Your your dynasty is getting information more and more, so

beliefs must converge to such that they would not.

There will be state.

Okay.

And the key result, which is, you know, it's very

obvious when you look at it, but, you know, you

do need all the assumptions of the way.

So let's Istar and let's start with the true parameter

okay.

And E star is the equilibrium level of effort.

Beliefs must converge to justify the the income that you

observe.

Right.

Because if they don't justify the income then you will

update.

The income that you observe under the true parameters is

what's on the right hand side.

So pi star plus theta star times is the that

you're choosing.

Why are you choosing one star?

Because I'm assuming beliefs of converge.

So there is a clear effort of choosing okay.

So this is the income you observe.

You don't observe the Pi style To start to observe

some level of income, and on the left hand side

is the possible pi and theta that will justify what

you're doing.

Okay, so given a star, the data has to be

at the total level of income according to your belief

should equal what you reduce.

It's a very simple point.

There is a two dimensional answer.

So two things to know.

First, there is two dimensional uncertainty okay.

So even if a-star was not endogenous but you know

someone would someone else who determines for me okay.

Because of the two dimensional uncertainty, I cannot identify if

it's data.

So I may have the wrong beliefs.

I may think that pi is too low and theta

too high, or the other way around, as long as

the total income is the same that is acceptable.

It's just not ideal.

But the second point is that the E star is

endogenous.

Okay.

So potentially you could have individuals in society which think

that theta is zero.

We're not asking how do they get there.

It's usually okay.

It's possible.

Theta is zero which means that they would put zero

effort, which means that they would learn pi star for

sure, or they will have the wrong beliefs about theta.

They will sort of, uh.

You know, allude themselves to the they will imagine the

zero and and they don't need to exert that effort.

There's no point in exerting effort.

Uh, alternatively, in the opposite direction, there could be individuals

that would overestimate theta and take the plug.

Is not playing any wrong Okay.

Or very little Ron.

Uh, they they would understand perfectly.

That'd be the star.

Okay.

They think maybe that, you know, the Pi Zero star.

And, uh.

So.

I mean.

The.

The actual analysis is a little bit more complicated.

So in society, if you have enough people that think

that that is zero.

I think it's all about luck.

They will have taxation that is quite high, which will

even, uh, depress the incentives to work of the individuals

that have different beliefs.

Okay.

On the other hand, if the majority is such that

they think that theta is high, they have low taxation,

um, and hence outcomes are actually going to agree more

on luck because the, the For those that don't work,

for those that have opposite beliefs.

Okay.

So individuals will not necessarily converge on the truth.

There is some history depending on how you know, the

outcomes that you observe is going to direct you to

which beliefs potentially allow us to explain this cross country

variation.

Say, okay, you know, if there is an attitude of

beliefs such that we think that it's mostly luck, we're

going to have low vaccination and hence very unequal economies.

Right?

Okay.

So you can explain inequality together with globalisation.

Whereas if we think that it's mostly about luck, we

will have more equal economies because we will be.

Okay.

It's not it doesn't give us a lot of predictive

power because lots of stuff can happen.

We just have essentially this equation.

So it's not that useful.

But it.

Does introduce an important role for attitudes beliefs.

Sometimes it's called culture.

It's very hard to define what.

What do we mean when we speak about culture.

You know, it's also something which is considered.

You know, the current focus on information, fake news, wrong

beliefs and so on.

I mean, it's clearly that something if you think about

how people form decisions to vote, yes, the development of

preferences, but the formation information could compose essentially is about

feelings.

Okay.

So that was uh, you know, I don't I don't

expect you to fully understand this model, but if you're

interested in it, it's a good paper to start on

this literature of endogenous, uh, endogenous formations of economic actions.

Taxation is this thing plays several roles.

Sorry if this can play several rounds in the past.

It's an infinite horizon game which which is converging on

this section.

But the political party, they can also use the policy

to change the like this structure.

Then the political game itself is just assuming medium form.

Uh, so you think about the image.

So everyone here was myopic.

So you can think about all these, uh, conditions can

affect changes.

Uh.

In which I might extend information that you have.

Here is just one example of the experimentation of other

households.

Yeah.

I mean, currently we have a much.

So this is already 30 years ago.

We have a much larger literature that looks at what

beliefs, belief collection, uh, and how belief changes.

So.

Good.

So, um.

Okay, so we went in one direction, which sort of

roughly covers the big things that were done, just flips.

Uh, so if I go back to sort of the

changes that we wanted to do, two arrow.

Uh, so one big change is more than one dimension.

So we've we've assumed, you know.

So we start this form abstract preferences that could have

been multidimensional of course.

And then we specialised in one dimension.

And uh, empirically there is sort of data that looks

at voters of people, Congress members, people, etc..

And a lot of this data tries to argue that

actually look at how they vote.

And you can summarise a lot more there.

So everyone that votes, uh, you know, right wing on

economic issues also votes right wing on MoveOn.org.

But it's first of all wasn't always the same dimension.

So for example, in the US, uh, those that first

went against slavery, the Republican Party won and then.

Banks 1360 and 1962.

We saw this dimensions change.

And what are the dimensions that we're abandoning?

Change.

If you think about Europe in the beginning of the

previous century, there was issues of rural versus urban.

There were clerical, the churches.

Churches that you mentioned that are very different to the

dimensions.

Of today.

So there could be something in the political system that,

you know, takes this multi dimensional real world and somehow

some dimension together that we can potentially observe one dimension.

So the question is, you know, just focusing on one

dimension.

Or it sort of breaks some of our understanding about

what the question, such as, you know, is the tax

rate the correct one if we just focus on one?

Or why are we getting it?

Okay.

So it's a big issue in political economy.

Uh, when people took downs and try to solve it

in more than one dimension, you can see that it's

going to be just a very basic model in which

you have two politicians that can't commit, that can commit.

This multi-dimensional, uh, essentially creates an environment in which there

is no pure strategy for general distribution.

Okay.

Why?

I mean, think about any multi simple multi dimensional problem

like, uh, three players.

Okay.

Three players trying to divide a dollar between them.

Okay.

So each node here represents uh, we should say.

Okay.

So each node here represents everything goes to player one.

Player three everything goes to the two.

Think about this model.

The model is just majority rule right.

So if I offer something here.

Okay.

Then let's say let's say I offer something here.

So once we get something equal then two can say

to three politicians can also two and three a better

division.

The three will get more and now two will get

two.

Right.

Okay.

And so, so whenever you offer something to two players,

a third player can take one of them, offers them

an epsilon more and Process acting on that one mindset.

Okay.

In economics, we would just say that the core is

empty.

Okay.

So there is no correlation.

It is stable when you just need two to agree.

So it's exactly the same thing when you think about

the three dimensional multi dimensional state space.

When you have two partitions one politicians you know often

something gets some sort of a majority.

The other politician is something else right.

So no pure strategy okay.

Unless the distribution of preferences satisfies that people are exactly

the same medium.

I mentioned something very non generic distinction.

This baffled the political scientist saying, you know we're going

to be in a state of chaos.

I mean, no, we're going to be able to have

a mix, right?

But we really didn't like it.

Describe what it is.

And make strategy.

Okay, so the last paper that I want to look

at.

Yes.

Is dependent with adjustment analysis.

So not.

I don't think that in this this particular model.

But the paper right now yes hasn't changed.

Okay.

So the paper that I will describe now the citizen

candidate model, there are two papers literature.

One is by post and.

The other is basically encodes our theme.

One is 94, one is 95 or maybe 95 and

96.

The different the exactly the same models besides the fact

that we encode Analyse it for strategic voters and skilful,

naive or sensitive.

But they do so.

So it's a general model that can allow us to

solve stuff in the policy space.

But they do an additional change to changes from dance.

So it's not only two dimensional.

There is uh.

No commitment.

Assumption.

Which we haven't really discussed.

So I'm discussing few changes in the same no different

assumption.

What does it mean?

Okay.

The idea is that the politicians or citizens like us,

when they run for office, they can either offer the

ideal policy or not run it.

That also introduces entry.

And we're going to assume that there are some cost

of entry a little bit related to your adjustment, for

example, exactly the same.

You can also introduce benefit from winning.

So office friends.

But let's think about this.

So the model is is following in the first stage.

At the entry stage the politicians are playing the game

and they just as before the politicians are often platforms.

Now they decide to run right.

The citizens are assumed to have perfect knowledge of the

ideal policies of those who run.

And also, you know, Everyone that could see, right.

She considered deviations.

Uh, because.

I know perfectly well when they run.

I know perfectly well.

Here is.

Of course, this is the extension of this.

Uh, and then given the set of politicians that run

for office, people vote for simplicity.

Let's think about the neighbours.

Okay, so voters know the ideal policy of politicians.

We have an election stage and to a degree this

entry cost.

So the friction that limit entry and deviation like what

you want to do for an adjustment that may not

be worthwhile for me to enter the competition.

So if we limit the creations in this way, we

are more likely to find out.

How do we even start thinking about equilibria?

So first of all, I'm going to first describe equilibrium

in one dimension because the model is also relevant to

one dimension, right?

It's interesting to compare it to the ground model.

Okay.

And the way to think about this is to think

about equilibria and distinguish them by simply the number of

people that run.

Okay.

So we can ask ourselves, do we have equilibrium or

equilibrium with just one politician running?

So let's say that, uh, zero politician running is never

an equilibrium, so that the entry goes to such that

if you if we don't if nobody runs society, you

know, you get two minus three.

So there is always one person.

So if I take the one dimension, remember we have

some medium here.

So we can ask us if do we have an

equilibrium.

Which one politician is running after this.

And if so, what is the policy that these politicians

are uh, in who's run.

So for sure we have an equilibrium in which the

medium is running.

Right.

Because I said that, you know, given that no one

else is running.

It's better for me to run rather than not run.

And society collapses.

So that's my assumption.

Okay.

Note that because of the entry codes running, running for

office now is also some provision of a public loop.

Right.

So if if, for example, someone that is relatively close

to the median is running.

Okay.

So now let's forget about the median running let's say

140.

Let's look at the equilibrium in one in which one

politician is running.

And this politician is relatively close to the median.

So it could be.

So who could win against this Against this one.

I mean, I guess the set of politicians here will

eventually, I guess this against this red dot, if the

entry cost is such that, you know, winning and gaining

this difference in utility in terms of the utility from

the outcome is not worth it, then it's also an

equilibrium in which someone other than the median is running.

And.

So already in the one dimension we get different results.

But by by looking at this, uh, running.

So that's how we classify it sort of equilibria with

one platform.

Now we can move on.

Think about the equilibria in which two politicians are running.

We have a before we didn't have this type of

model for information and the logical.

But now because of both, uh, you know, entry cost

and because of the fact that I, I can't, you

know, deviate by switching to another point.

Right.

Switching to another policy is like a double deviation.

I'm not running and someone else decides to run.

So I'm limiting the deviation.

So I'm going to have a larger set of equilibrium.

Okay.

So for example you know I could have an equilibrium

in which two people are running.

Each of them is winning, you know.

So the median is indifferent between these two.

Before we said, ah, you know, one politician would move

a little bit.

Now the politician cannot move.

You can only decide not to run.

So it has to be that for each of these

politicians, the cost of running is such that it's worthwhile

for them to win for maybe 50% against the other

guy.

That would mean that the polarisation has to be large

enough, right?

Because if we were to close it out, on the

other hand, polarisation cannot be too large because if it's

too large, then maybe someone like the media finds it

worthwhile to enter and then grab, you know, larger shifts.

So the distribution of preferences and the cost of running,

that is exactly the region in which this polarisation.

Can be sustained.

So it's it's quite different types of reasoning.

Think about the politicians here.

Uh, you can see already the, you know, restricting the

deviations allows us to find a large.

So particularly complicated stuff here because, uh.

For example, I said they can't be too divergent because

then maybe the medium will enter.

And I was using the fact that photos of voting

early.

So if it's too divergent, the medium can get them

both.

But if both is a strategic and for some reason

ignore coordinate on ignoring the deviation of the media and

keeping on voting to these two that could be staged.

So introducing equilibrium effect coordination.

Uh.

Ruins.

This possibility potentially is a way to ruin this possibility.

So yeah, I think it's a bit too much and

definitely in terms of understanding the key I just think.

You know, to a degree.

Uh, let's think for a second about three platforms and

then discuss these names and share a little bit more.

If I think about three platforms.

It's actually very similar to what we discussed before.

Remember, the politicians are ideological.

And now if the expected outcome falls, if I'm the

right wing one, the expected outcome falls here.

I should not enter.

Okay.

I should not enter because I like splitting the vote

of the right.

Is that the right wing scrapping?

And if I leave, then all the voters.

All my vote.

This person is a better.

Expectation.

Because of his naive voters, meaning that I can.

You know, I know exactly what voters are going to

do once I set the platform with new voters in

this candidate environment.

We don't have a free platform.

It's a little bit like thinking that like the politicians

coordinate.

Right?

Some sort of equilibrium coordination.

Competition allows the voters not to split the votes too

much.

So even if they're naive, there is some coordination that

is done by.

Okay.

Or alternatively, we can think about the politicians not doing

this coordination and then strategic voters can call them.

It seems very difficult for, you know, the large group

of voters to coordinate and their expectations of, you know,

we should vote for if there is a deviation compared

to actually the politicians coordinating this.

So this type of reasoning, it's as if like, you

know, it's not that we are explicitly coordinating here as

politicians, but, you know, being implicitly in equilibrium creates a

situation as if from the outside, we would think that,

you know, the centre right is coordinating centre.

Okay.

And then I'm throwing a lot of stuff in the

lecture.

But then if you think about this and taking into

consideration.

There's nothing, you know, special added in this intuition.

Uh, the only thing is that the cost of running,

if you can somehow, you know, split the voters, maybe

half, half you could get rid of, like this.

Um, no one else, you know, given to running.

No one.

No one else.

So, yes.

Should be.

The one that should be, uh, you should be able

to defeat it and get votes and win again with

the right.

Yeah.

I'm sorry.

Okay, so what I would like you to do is

to actually wait.

You can read both, but I think it's efficient to

think, uh.

We will build on that, especially doing some more interesting

analysis, thinking about how parties actually combine several dimensions to

sort of to bundle them, uh, so that, you know,

sometimes in society we can observe one dimension, for example,

that it comes from a, an endogenous process.

Ah.

Okay.

So we've explored, you know, so this was one dimension

restriction.

We explored only a little bit.

Just uh.

a very faint first taste of you know we think

about multi dimension.

But then.

We discuss the continuation of the course.

Uh then there was a literature that looking at explicitly

keeping the social welfare, social choice function, general options and

preferences.

But give up on the idea the independence of irrelevant

axiom which means that the cardinality method.

So how much some people value one option compared to

others, and so everyone slightly values A to B.

And I really, really, really hate to be, you know,

maybe there there are ways to, to get, uh, to

get compromise, which is better for everyone.

It makes sense.

Uh, there are some social welfare function that, that, that

look into that.

So both done was actually the same generation already offered

the social welfare function.

It's called the Golden rule.

This is the same rule that we use with the

Eurovision Song Contest.

Have you seen it?

Okay, so what do you do?

It's cardinality matters because you're giving 12 points for your

top ten, and then you go down one by one.

Okay.

So there is a different different bigger difference in your

top three compared to all the others.

The numbers matter and the numbers are added.

So you've got 29m and so that.

Yeah.

So I didn't like this this time.

Another interesting thing about Kundu says he was a big,

uh, advocate for women's rights, uh, both voting rights and

also reproductive rights.

Okay.

So we're mainly going to go over different types of

institutions uh, legislators parties.

And that's what I would focus on mainly thinking about

these questions of, you know, how do we resolve issues

such as such as redistribution and how is it manifested?

We would ask questions like, are they good institutions?

What do we mean by good?

Uh, do they aggregate preferences in the right way?

Uh, do they aggregate information in the right way, even

if we all have the same preferences?

But information is somehow decentralised, uh, decentralised economy.

You know, we've seen some examples.

We can, you know, it could be that everyone has

the same parameters, but profit is extended, but somehow information

is aggregated just by assumption.

They're This is not allowing people to observe one another,

but also because effort was endogenously affecting what you can

observe.

Um, so this is also sort of a valuable question

to ask.

How do these institutions arise?

That would be a more sometimes general discussion that we

might want to think about.

Uh, and then I've mentioned sort of a less institutional

explanation, thinking about beliefs, political attitudes, uh, some other religious

organisations, uh, talk about discrimination.

Um, yeah.

So I think so.

A reminder if you want to present something, let me

know.

Or so last year I, I, I did the last

two lectures on discrimination.

People were interested.

But if you're interested in something else.

I think.

Um, if you want to talk to me, I'm happy

for the time.

I have a formal office hour, but I'm sure it

will be fast.

So just, you know.

And next week.

They were just skimming through what they said.

Um, yeah.

And I want to move the page.

I've been running a couple of days, and I've sent

you messages.

Good.

Thank you.

Okay.

Is that.

Okay.

Yeah.

No.

No, no.

Leave me alone.

I think you said.

That.

Ah!

What's the matter?

Why didn't you say anything?

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Well you shouldn't.

Yes.

No.

I have to shut up.

Yes.

Yes.

Good.

That's a good one.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Right.

Yes.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Exactly.

Okay.

Yeah.

That's.

I think.

Yeah.

Yeah.

This could be paralysing.

Any ideas?

Yeah.

What was I thinking?

That a lot of my better ideas of ones that,

like, I'm just gonna have, like, enough stuff to be

able to write so I don't really fit in in

a second year context.

I'm not sure.

Okay.

Doesn't have to be right.

Yeah.

Okay.

I think.

Something interesting.

All right?

Yeah.

It's just a message.

Yeah.

What are you working on for Tim?

Uh.

Well, I think.

None of this might save you because.

Lecture 2:

Step, right?

So I'm looking for.

My.

Hello.

Are you.

Look up.

Are you?

I would you say I sent an email?

Yeah.

Okay.

All right, all right, all right.

I'm looking for with local knowledge about the because they

changed the computer system, so.

You are more than you have from Marion and Dennis.

Hello.

For all the university in Finland.

Okay.

Hello there.

Hi.

Hi.

Are you in the system?

Sorry.

Are you Yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

Okay.

Do you know how long the switches on the screen

are?

Okay.

It should be here, I think.

Then.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

Here we are.

Very good local knowledge.

Hi.

How are you?

Thank.

Okay.

So how many people should I expect given last week?

More like seven, I think.

The wrong.

Around seven people around seven.

Yeah, okay.

Sorry.

Can you see this?

I'll bring it back.

Yeah.

Okay.

Will you wait until five after?

I decided.

To do it.

Okay.

It's better.

What?

No.

Thanks.

Just.

It's closed.

It's okay.

Did you check right there?

No, sorry.

It's okay.

Thanks.

Yeah.

Yeah.

What I was thinking this year.

Like.

Next year.

Is what?

I think it's going to be a pretty big storm.

But afterwards.

Yeah.

What?

Should I do next?

Okay.

Probably not.

So it's.

Probably not available.

Yet.

Yeah, I.

Couldn't find.

It.

Okay, I ask and I'll do it.

There you go.

Yeah.

I want to talk to you.

Oh, I have to thank you.

So I.

Think that's awesome.

Okay.

So, um.

Hi.

In the interest of maintaining a reputation right now.

Um, so.

Hi, I'm Thorsten.

Uh, you're gonna see me this week and the three

subsequent weeks.

Um, and, um.

Yeah.

Uh, this nominally, this should be uploaded to the course

page.

I asked em to do it, but she hasn't gotten

around to it yet, so you don't need to take

meticulous notes.

They will be available, so focus on that understanding.

No.

Thank you.

Um.

Anyway, maybe since, uh, I recognise one face or two

and maybe you can just tell me, uh, where you're

at if you, uh.

Yeah, the city or elsewhere and, uh, what the area

of info is.

I am Juan, I am a fourth year, I'm from

London Business School, and I'm doing marketing MBA here because

of political.

Yeah, yeah, I'm watching and I'm from UCLA.

Doing a PhD.

I mean, my surgeon, right?

Yeah.

I'm Alex, I'm at the NSC.

I can say that.

And also in NSC and.

Also I'm here to Emory's students in economics.

Their main interest is the the political.

Yeah.

Hi, I'm Ellen.

I'm a visiting PhD student from alpine, and, uh, I

think Alison.

And Andrea and.

Primary, uh, first year PhD student.

And I'm interested in.

University.

Environment.

And I'm Laura, and I'm at second year as well.

Okay, excellent.

Very good.

And, uh, and by the way, um, you have a

little bit different backgrounds, but, uh, you know, uh, do

stop me if I'm insulting your intelligence by going too

slow or time, you know, making myself incomprehensible or sort

it out, man.

So the scope of my section of the course will

be roughly two in this week and the next.

Uh, I'm continuing a journey that, uh, started last week,

namely sort of some of the basic building blocks that

we use in political economics.

And then in.

So that would be mostly applied theory or only applied

theory.

And this in week four and five, I'll zoom in

more ruthlessly on, on a particular topic, the topic of

political selection.

So you know who becomes a politician and become a

politician.

How do the architecture, the political leader and uh.

And more generally.

So I'll try to survey this theoretical in some theoretical

empirical tools.

And then of course these applications are not random, but

they are there to illustrate, uh, the practical use of

those tools as well, kind of the insights that we

get right, applying them.

So you can think of this, uh, what I do

is to look at two overall questions.

So one is, you know, we see economic policy theory,

uh, we see it vary across time, vary across place,

vary across institutions, political and others.

And so, you know, how can we understand such variation.

Uh, that's the these do these building building blocks the

basic theory.

Help us get a perspective right.

And the other for political selection is, as I said,

who is selected into politics and how do leaders use

their power?

They, uh, get up to give a very lucid introduction

to the field as a whole, but I control myself.

So let me say, my perspective on the field of

political economics is kind of the way I like to

think about it, is that it somehow amalgamate, um, different

traditions in economics and political science and put it together

into a more coherent whole whole, and hopefully sort of

deals with some of the weaknesses that these approaches had

from the beginning.

So in particular, uh, the theoretical approaches we'll be looking

at is, you know, comes from, from Three Roots with

as my perspective on the field, one is the theory

of macroeconomic policy.

So this is a literature in economics that started with,

uh, London at Prescott's uh, uh, famous paper from 1937

on the timing, consistency of economic policy, you know, subgame

perfection in, in, in game theory.

But people didn't understand exactly at the time, uh, and

uh, that emphasised, you know, rationality, some micro foundations.

But the in retrospect that the politics were pretty naive

and, uh, you know, limited to.

Yeah.

Suppose there is a medium there.

We apply what do we get uh, and discount this

credibility, uh, literature turned into political economics.

Literature is, you know, basically you think about an equilibrium

outcome.

When you think about credibility, you say not all policies

are equally interesting because only some of them are credible.

So we should focus on the credible policies because those

are the ones that we will observe.

But the step from that to, you know, not all

policies are are equilibrium because only some are politically feasible,

uh, given the constraints.

That's a pretty small step that.

Yeah, took that step at the time.

And let me.

See.

Then there's, um, an older tradition, uh, known as public

choice.

You know, it's still the annual meetings of the Public

Choice Society and all of that.

So this goes back to work by people like Buchanan

and Manser, also on the famous books from the from

the 60s, which are very strong on things like agency

constitutions, interest groups, free riding.

Uh, but maybe one has to say in after a

mass that relies on feeding values, methods that were not

mainstream in economics.

Always.

Sometimes they were necessary.

Then there is a school in in political science known

as rational choice, which sort of has its roots to

some degree in Anthony Downes theory of democracy and as

an economist to wrote the famous thesis at the University

of Chicago, uh, that helped us think about the political

process in elections.

But then there's also more, you know, fundamental work, uh,

perhaps by, you know, people like William Riker, who was

a big hero in among quantitative political scientists, ruled Rochester,

uh, became a top three four department under his leadership

and was for several, um, several decades.

And that literature kind of looks at the institutions collective

choice procedures.

But if there is some fault with it, one might

say that the policies that that, uh, are looked upon

here, I take it very seriously at some point in

our, uh, space of thinking.

And so the interaction with the economic side.

Uh, then, as I said, I think we have seen

some gradual improvements on, on this theoretical front.

And maybe we have the best traditions united in the

field.

On the empirical side, you know, this was not a

field that was had a lot of empirical work to

the extent there was some empirical work, it also suffered

from some from zero.

Identification was not very convincing.

But this was before the credibility revolution.

So.

And nothing new there.

Test of the theory were not, uh, very precise.

Now people use more solid theoretical foundations.

You know, institutional detail was not really taken much into

account now.

And, um, much of the findings that empirical political scientists

have come up with.

And then first, uh, you know, when you do empirical

work, if you put it in, you get shipped out

or say more positively, you don't get better, uh, more

interesting results and the quality of your data.

And in the beginning and the, you know, the work

relied on so very high quality aggregate data issues with

related or unrelated to the to the questions investigated.

Nowadays we have richer individual or group level.

Uh, data.

Uh, and then things become much, uh, more clear.

And the in the second half of my share of

the course, we illustrate how one can bring to bear

a very rich individual level register data for my own

country to bear on these questions of political selection.

Okay.

So let's dive into, uh, electoral competition.

So what I would aim to do is to then

begin this or continue this survey of workhorse models that

we use to think about policy choices.

And so that's a little very, uh, kind of Logical

purpose.

But in the process, we will also kind of illustrate,

uh, political forces that help certain benefits, uh, take advantage

of the political process and then than others.

And, you know, I don't know if you, uh, read

Alexander's, uh, exciting book on the Cuban missile crisis, uh,

a fantastic book, um, which sort of has the point.

He takes a look at the Cuban Missile Crisis and,

you know, there was almost a knock out over it.

Russian missiles, uh, on their way to Cuba.

And he says, no, let's look at this set of

events, and it talks about several events from three different

angles, three different theoretical angles.

And then the point is you look at 100 different

street lights, uh, of the.

this theoretical framework.

You see different things.

And so the explanations you come up with for, uh,

for them, why the Russians eventually drove back and how

the Americans acted, you know, you you get a different

perspective.

And similarly, when we use different theories or different theoretical

models to look at the same kind of political process,

we shed light on different aspects.

So that will come out, I hope.

Uh, so methodologically, uh, I will try to hold the

policy problems constant.

So, you know, we will deal with two things that

the government has to do.

One, uh, yeah, we do two models of government spending,

how to, uh, determine government spending.

And then the, um, the outcomes are going to hinge

on the assumptions that would make it about electoral rule,

uh, capacity or not, but politicians to commit themselves to

a policy, uh, and the objectives that politicians have, or

alternatively speaking, the types of politicians by sort of in

the same environment over these two models.

So government spending will hopefully this rate how its modelling

filters out different factors, determinants of uh policy.

So uh, first I'll introduce those two models.

Then we'll look at the very classical dancing framework in

electoral competition I call it uh, we'll see that uh,

sometimes that give us a very clear conclusion.

Sometimes it doesn't give any conclusions at all.

So we'll expand, uh, that setting with what's known now

as probabilistic voting form a random utility from the viewpoint

of politicians.

And then we'll, uh, expand it once more.

Uh, in the beginning, they will just be voting by

by individuals in the society.

But then there are interest groups, and they can also

affect the political process.

So we'll expand the framework once again adding such interest

groups.

See what happens.

Uh, and then we'll go from the downside and electoral

competition where politicians are assumed just that the opportunistic they

want to hold power.

And that's a goal in life.

And that's it to kind of point it in competition

with politicians or instead, like most of us, driven by

ideological concerns to some degree.

And, you know, how does that change the change the

picture.

And then at the very end will be running for

time.

But then I'll try to get back to this question

about, you know, which groups are politically powerful according to

what we have done.

Okay.

So you have general questions.

Now is the time to post them because next we'll

dive into the modelling.

Okay.

Very good.

So the first um model of government spending I'll look

at I'll call the size of government.

By the way this is I'm following a bit, uh,

self-centred by the text that I've been, uh, writing on

this a long time ago now with with the Bellini.

And, uh, so the material here is in scattered a

little bit over that book, but.

Mostly chapter three and chapter seven would be references for

this.

So think about, uh, a continuum of orders, uh, and

the population size or formerly the mass of the population.

And we call that n.

Then there are consumers, taxpayers, voters, individuals of different types,

and we'll denote types uppercase J.

And uh, they will run across.

There will be a large number of groups.

Typically um a member of group J has quasi linear

preferences.

So that is determined by a private consumption C j.

So j is superscript is the group indicator.

And then uh, it's augmented by uh a utility.

Of public goods.

Right.

H is a concave function.

Um, and notice that the G here doesn't have any

group index.

In particular, we assume that these public goods are provided

equal to, uh, provision to everyone.

Uh, so so that's, uh, uh, that part of policy

is, you know, quite a bit.

It's just for everyone to benefit from to the extent

that it fits within this function.

Uh, and then the, the second piece is that, you

know, this stuff has to be financed with an income

tax.

That is also the same for everyone, so no targeting

there either.

So that just closes the model saying that the private

consumption of an individual.

This is a static world.

Uh, is given by a gross income y j equal

to everyone with a member group.

J times one minus tau is the income tax rate,

right?

So where's the rub?

And where does the politic enters?

Well, it enters via the income distribution.

So this is going to be the source of political

conflict and the only source of political conflict.

So let's assume that this YJ this group level incomes

uh, are uh, the CDF, um, which we call uppercase

F, uh, with the properties that, you know, we've just

introduced the notation that, you know, the expected value or

the average level of income is equal to y.

It's just, uh, you know, J means it's an average

or the economy y.

So here is the average level of income.

And then if we evaluate that CDF that one half

I when we split the population in half, then the

level of income that's associated with that group or that

individuals is lower than the average, uh, level in society.

And it's a qualitative assumption, but it's a very weak

assumption.

You know, I've seen many measures of income distributions that,

uh, in the history of, of our field and all

of them has skewed the right.

Okay.

So how about the group structure.

So So this is great because they are distinct groups.

So let let there be script j groups.

Uh so and let's introduce the convention that J this

index of group belonging runs from one through J.

Um in such a way that, you know, we go

in the order of increasing income.

So group one group script J establishes.

There are population shares associated with these groups.

Uh, they are always below one half.

So no group has as their own majority.

Good thing about the large number groups.

And this will be trivially fulfilled.

And the group shares sum to one.

And a few times, just to make a point, uh,

I will specialise this to an example with three groups

when I consider, you know, the poor white income of

the poor, the middle class and the rich, uh, you

start to wonder, why do we require the population that

has to be less than one half?

If, uh, if they were, if one population share above

one half, then most models with their second participation would

just have that group win and dominate them.

So what's the utility function?

Sorry.

What were the utility functions?

Utility functions were quasi linear.

Uh, in in private consumption linear.

And then this concave.

Yes.

Okay.

So finally we need to do to close the model

is to, um, introduce the government budget.

And, uh, you know, we can write that, uh, sort

of some basic principles.

This is, uh, the group share times the income of

each group.

We're summing over those, and we're multiplying by the common

tax rate that gives us total per capita income because

it's weighted average.

But, uh, using this notation, we can write that as

how and why.

Because average income is by definition y.

And then that has to be equal to the per

capita spending that the gap is.

So we have two government controlled things floating around.

We have the tax rate.

We have the have the capital spending level.

Um, obviously only one of them is independent.

If the government is required to fulfil its budget constraint,

and here there's no borrowing.

Uh, touchstone.

That's true.

Uh, and sometimes it matters which policy instrument you deal

with in this setting.

It doesn't.

So I'm going to treat g spending level as the

one dimensional policy instrument.

And that's going to be a scalpel.

Right.

Now the next step we have to take is to

express these individuals who are consumers and are hit by

these taxes are beneficiaries of the spending, but as so

they will be voting based on their policy preferences.

So we want to express that policy preference as a

function of the policy variable that we have assigned.

So as a function g.

So then we take that utility function which was linear

in consumption.

And we just replace it from the government budget constraint.

So it was one minus tau times yj that I

replace uh uh by g over y and I replace

one by y over y.

So I can write it in this way.

And then I have the utility of, uh, of spending

here is why did I write it in this way?

Because this is, uh, you know, illustrates the, the tension

that there are between different, different people or different group

members.

And in particular, we can think about y, J or

y as a tax right.

That person of a particular group is for having government

spending supplied, uh, to them.

And broadly speaking, the poorer you are, the less you

pay on.

On the margin for an expansion of government spending, the

richer your, uh.

What are you paying?

Uh, on the margin.

And therefore there's going to be less points for for

members of these groups that are monotonically varying with income

and simplicity.

Most of what I said was that poorer people would

like a higher level of spending, because they're paying us

more.

The share rich people want less.

So if we say, right, GJ for the for the

lowest point of group J, we can take the first

order condition here, which would be just that the derivative

of, of uh, utility public good is equal to the

cost, and the cost is YJ over y.

So take that first order condition, invert it and called

the inverse function that you obtained for G.

Just get some simpler notation.

And then that would be a declining function.

Uh.

So this, this policy preferences in this policy example, uh,

are very, very well behaved, uh, in terms of, you

know, the properties that they have and the ease with

which, uh, they let themselves analysed.

So now this policy preference is concave because that's h

is and it's also single peaked in policy I, there

is a unique optimum level from the viewpoint that every

group.

As we have already said g is monotonic.

It's monotonically decreasing in.

True incomes.

The derivative of the policy preference is monotonic in this

tax.

Right.

So you know that's the reason why we get this.

So sort of version of single crossing would withhold.

And all of this together means that there exists what's

known as a counter, say a winner and for that

matter a unique contract.

So let me just check your your background.

So what what is the conversation?

Uh, someone okay elucidate us on that?

Unique majority winner.

And the first thing.

Yeah.

Okay.

So Condorcet, who was he?

He was a French mathematician, philosopher, genius in the 1700s

who came up with different things.

And he studied, you know, uh, some voting problems.

And he postulated that a good property, uh, of, uh,

of a political process is that, you know, it finds

the, the, uh, unique policy or finds a at least

a policy.

It's a unique policy that can beat any other policy

proposal.

In a pairwise vote in the election.

So that's what this means.

So if you take this policy and you pitch it

against any other possible, uh, for capital spending, then this

one will win.

Uh, and the argument for that is very simple.

It relies on this monotonicity.

So, you know, suppose that uh we pitch the the

the medium motor solution against a higher level of spending.

Then, uh, you know, the media prefers it.

Uh, but, uh, my construction, um, because it's the optimal,

the median.

But, uh, on her side, she also has everyone, uh,

who is richer than herself because they hate large spending

even more than the median in this example.

So there will be a majority for sure for this

proposal.

And then you can repeat the argument for a smaller

level of spending of the, of the coalition.

Uh, like it's so that's the, uh, a property that

is sometimes useful and it holds in this model.

Yeah, I have some, uh, some normative, uh, thing, but,

uh, about what?

What would be the socially optimal level of spending?

Uh, but there are limits to what you can say

about, you know, socially optimal in a, in a world

where there's an income distribution and people have linear utility

in consumption.

So it's a little bit, uh, but for what it's

worth, if you were to maximise average utility here, which

is what this problem is, you would find that, you

know, you get utility function by aggregation here.

That is linear in G.

Uh, because there is, you know, average tax prices equal

to one.

And then, you know, you just pick the, the, the

policy that equates the marginal utility of public spending to

that average tax price, which is one, and I call

that which is not referred to it, to come to

terms.

Now, of course, this was a very specific example, but

uh, it exemplifies, uh, you know, a large number of

problems that has been studied in, in the field of

political economics.

Um, we in the text we call the this kind

of general interest politics, uh, in the sense that there

is some one dimensional non-targeted policies that gives rise to

some monotonic policy preferences.

And in particular, we saw how the the relative income

of each group, uh, dictated those policy, the direction of

those sports preferences.

So the political conflict that we are looking at is

a vertical policy conflict across these individuals or across these

groups of individuals, and it is tied to, you know,

the redistributive cost of providing government spending.

So, uh, you know, we can think about it as

a, you know, somehow capturing the left and right.

Uh, dimension in politics, which is really about class or

redistribution as such.

And as I said, that has been a common theme

in, in, particularly in the early literature.

Okay.

So now let's go to the other example, which I

instead called the composition of the outcome.

So again this will be very simple.

Notation will be very simple similar.

We'll have skip j groups from one through J with

shares.

That's up to one.

Now we are not going to have any income heterogeneity

whatsoever.

So within a group people have the same income.

That's how it was before but also across groups.

You can have the same income.

So everyone has the same income level maybe the average

income.

What are their utilities.

Again things look very conspicuously similar to what we had

before.

So utility of a member group J is linear in

consumption of that of that group.

And then it's h of g h of government spending

a concave function.

But there is A1A notational very important difference.

This GJ before this was the average level, uh, which

was non-targeted.

Now, this is a spending level, uh, by government that

is solely directed to this group.

Uh, so only Group J has utility out of this

particular spending item, and each group has such a spending,

I of course, we could study things where there are

spill-overs.

So, um, between, uh, spending levels, uh, but that would

just mess up the algebra without making it much wiser.

Conceptually.

Quantitatively, maybe very important, uh, to to take that into

account.

But so here, government spending is not, uh, represented by

us by a scalar.

It's a vector, uh, one targeted level of spending for

each group.

And I'll call that, um, vector Gee, this is slight

abuse of notation.

I should perhaps use a boldface here such to define

as a vector, which is convenient abuse of notation, because

it means that, you know, uh, it's still going to

be the case that I can write the policy preferences

now as a function, g is just that g is

a vector in this case.

And therefore I'll be able to carry the analysis, uh,

of these two models to a point, uh, before I

specialise it.

And some of the lessons we will get will be

common.

That's just a categorical metric.

Okay.

So how how do we interpret these groups?

Well, we we appeal to people may have different preferences.

The government sometimes supply opera and theatre.

Some people like that.

Other people are like sports.

The government is subsidising sports so it can be defined

by preference structure.

The government spends on different things indirectly that benefits different

people because there are supplier suppliers in those sectors that

supply those things.

So that could be another, uh, interpretation.

Perhaps the most natural one is that people live in

different places and, you know, you build a bunch of

roads and, uh, some roads are mostly, uh, giving utility

to people in the north.

And so it's a very generic property of any government

program.

Now, how about the politics?

Well, uh, if we were to look for a utilitarian

optimum here, then we would sort of maximise the sum

of the utilities.

This item here, subject to the constraint that.

Let's suppose that we can convert, uh, government goods and

private goods, one for one.

And this is the appropriate constraint.

That's, uh, uh, that's our objective.

And then, you know, we, we maximise, uh, uh, that

then we get that for each group, we should equate

the marginal utility of man spending to the tax cost.

Everyone has the same tax cost, namely one.

So this defines the optimum provision of every member of

this sector.

So this would be could be implemented by decentralised spending

So let each group pay for the roads.

So pay for the road.

Pay for their, uh.

Whatever.

Uh, so then the groups would all internalise the full

cost of, uh, of providing that good and the right

level.

So this doable, but, uh, that would be kind of

boring.

Uh, I think it would be, uh, much, you know,

much insights into politics.

And, you know, this is not what governments do.

Uh, a lot of that work.

So instead, we're going to study a centralised government budget

rather than, you know, letting each group finance its own.

Uh, good.

So g the vector now is funded by common tax.

Uh, it could be an income tax, but since everyone

has the same income, it doesn't that much.

So I am just writing this resulting budget constraint is

wk equals to income minus that had tax and that

had tax is set at the level such that it

can finance this whole vector of government.

Now we do get the political conflict.

And this relates closely to a point that was made

or already by early scholars in particular, mass revolts were

pushing, pushing, pushing and pushing it this point, namely, that

targeted spending will be oversupplied because groups have an.

Incentive to free some others.

If I'm only paying a share of what the cost

is to me, I'd rather have it than not have

it while I have more have until I exhausted that

three possibility.

And that's, uh, what this, uh, simple example will illustrate

too.

So write the policy preferences of Group J as their

income minus their head tax, plus the utility of the

spending directly to them.

And we call that WJ of G.

Now this is the abuse of notation.

This is a policy preference expressed over G.

But now G is a vector.

And scalar has previous exam.

So here we see that you know each group would

only internally share alpha J which is its share of

the cost that is paying for for goods to itself.

And then we want a free ride on others.

So in this case I said that WJ uh was

very well behaved.

This, these policy preferences are very ill behaved in the

sense that they don't fulfil a single condition of those

that, uh, people have put policy preferences in, in the,

in the literature you can check.

Chapter two of the text, if you want to look

at some of these conditions and none of them are

fulfilled.

And in particular, it's very hard to write down any

monotonic policy preferences here.

So there is not going to be a Congress anyway.

In other words, you know, uh, I pick a pick

a policy, uh, that needs some other policy, but then

someone else can beat that policy by picking out another

policy proposal.

And that's already called cycling will just continue.

And there's no rest point in that that process.

So the this example, the composition of government, it also

exemplifies a class of politics, uh, that appears in the

real world.

I would argue very strongly and also in the literature,

of course.

And we call that special interest politics here.

Sometimes political scientists talk about this as cake splitting problems.

Uh uh, you know, a larger share of the cake

is each group going to.

Yeah.

And here in our example, the size of the cake

itself is also.

And Orchard Park, whatever solution we can come up with.

So here then policy is not non-targeted.

It's targeted towards groups.

It's not one dimensional, it's multi dimensional.

And so this is not on this vertical policy conflict

across a group feature.

It's sort of horizontal policy across groups at whatever their

income level is.

You know it would be a big difference if I

did that.

Okay.

So that's so much for introduction.

And now let me take you through, uh, one the

first example, which is, you know, uh, roughly what Downes

proposed in, in his, in his thesis in the, well,

60 years ago.

Um, anyway, so it turns out so here are the

sort of conventional assumptions that that people associate with with

down.

Or spatial electrical competition.

It's not exactly what downstairs and uh, but uh close

enough.

So five assumption.

So first one there are only two candidates.

They are given.

And uh uh, no, no entry or exit out of

politics.

We label them, I see per candidate and try to

give a better name.

A and B, uh, those are the two candidates.

What?

What they do, they simultaneously commit themselves to an electoral

platform.

So I.

They make a promise to the voters.

If you elect me, this is what I'm going to

give you.

And that's, uh.

that's that's, uh, you know, irrevocable commitment that cannot be

broken, exposed.

It's an assumption.

Uh, but that's what we did.

Turns out that the clear promises tend to be more

often fulfilled than, uh, than one thinks.

Yes, there are exceptions.

So watch my lips.

Yeah.

No, no new taxes.

But, uh, I didn't push it on that one, but,

uh, yeah, 70, 80% of of outright policy had to

be capped.

But maybe there are other forces coming.

Who knows?

Here is you.

You commit to a platform.

So it says G, A and B for SGB.

And now for this level.

This is the a scandal.

If we were in the in the example of sister

government, it could be a vector if it's a composition.

So they make those promises before a plurality election, meaning

the majority.

The who collects a majority wins and implements our platform.

Everybody votes.

We don't consider it as a participation decision or not.

Uh, that's a whole subject about how to think about

electoral turnout.

There is, uh, you know, the voting, paradoxically, uh, you

know, the very oriented argument would be I'm an atom,

you know, at least in a large election.

Uh, my, if I think about the Prospective benefit from

participating would be to change the vote.

Then I wouldn't vote because it's costly to vote.

You know my goal changing the outcome is zero.

So then the only thing approach is to to turn

out to be to appeal to some sociological notion.

You want to do your duty.

And so there are group oriented models involved in such

matters, but not here.

So everybody in the election and when the candidates make

these commitments.

Yeah.

Do that just for, uh, opportunistic reasons.

Informally they want to expect their maximise, their expected ignorance.

So let our bar be a positive number which captures

the, you know, the value to a candidate holding office

and the expected and you get by multiplying that number

which you see where is the probability PC denotes the

probability of winning for candidate.

Okay.

So this is the probability for for candidate A that

is going to be a function of the sending promises

that is to uh candidates make uh and conditioned on

those things.

It's the probability that the vote share pi a vote

share of candidate A is above than or equal to

half.

It's a.

Nice.

Thing here about how we break is this inequality.

But you know such a there would be exactly if

there are other even number of voters.

Yeah.

I'm escaping.

Just saying it too.

Um, can it be.

Has the complementary probability.

Uh, and so that's that.

Those are the assumptions.

Now let's look at the that in, in the size

of government case.

Um, and uh, so what we need to understand is

how this probability of winning function behaves as a function

of, uh, those, uh.

Commitments, policy commitments that the candidates make and, uh, yeah.

So we just assume that people are participating.

They don't take this, uh, uh, decision to participate, given

that they are participating.

They're voting for the for the candidate whose proposal gives

them the highest utility.

Right.

I'm voting for candidate a third proposal.

Uh, gives me higher more than candidate this proposal.

And the desire is to give me in the same

way than flipping a coin, uh, or such.

So now the monotonicity of these policy preferences that we

discuss, uh, these rights back is going to be very

short on this Condorcet Condorcet reasoning will imply, uh probability

of winning function that is very discontinuous.

Right.

So if the median group is like the A's proposal

relative to candidates B Proposal.

Uh, then probability of winning of candidate A will be

equal to zero.

And that's because the median is joined by either everyone

is richer or everyone that is poorer.

So they cannot be a vote share of the, uh,

candidate A that is uh, equals to one half.

On the other hand, if the median uh group likes

A's proposal better than B, so does another half of

the electorate because of the amount of city and therefore

the vote share of A will always be above one

half.

So the probability of winning is.

The median voters indifferent between the two proposals.

And yeah, we can assume that this split coin uh,

I mean, uh, coin toss about wins and the probability

the winning of both candidates will be one half.

So there is this stark discontinuity of the probability, the

winning function at any pair of proposals such that the

media group is indifferent.

So one interpretation of this, if you want to have

a real world interpretation, is that political competition is very,

very stiff.

It doesn't take more than a year to, uh, to,

to, to, to change the probability of winning for the

candidates.

And as you, you know, Nash and Condorcet will agree

here if we study a national average of, of this

game, to think about this as a game and study

the Nash equilibrium of that game, then, you know, there's

only one rest point, and that is that both the

candidate offer what the medium would prefer, because this is

their only chance of having a positive probability of winning.

Uh, and that's the only thing they care about is

winning, because they are still our motivation.

So that's what.

Yeah.

So what do you learn from this?

Well, we get certain predictions.

Uh, since it focuses on this model, focuses on inequality,

it's natural to look for predictions in terms of inequality.

Uh, so it would say that if we considered a

large number of jurisdictions, say, all the municipalities of Sweden,

which would be 291 of the states of the US,

we can choose to pick.

That's only 50.

But yeah, you can think about your, your favourite, uh,

uh, you know, the municipalities in Korea as a whole

country or Japan, whatever.

Uh, uh, then we get that more inequality is associated

with a higher level of spending, but it's more inequality

in a very specific sense.

Right.

So in um, in particular, it is the income of

the median participant in the election to the average level

of income.

So this is not the Gini coefficient.

This is not a 9010 ratio, uh, or some other

measure of inequality.

Uh, and, you know, there's a big literature, particularly from

the early, uh, early work.

I didn't find much support for this assumption.

Uh, part of it may be that they were, you

know, not thinking about the connection between the theory and

the measurement and supporter theory ahead of measurement.

Um, but, um, uh, even if they had done so,

uh, they wouldn't have found much support for, for this,

uh, this prediction.

So another prediction would be the time series data that's

the same jurisdiction, but over a large long period of

time, maybe, you know, over to the early 19th century.

You can measure things in the US government or, uh,

in some other countries with plausible and good statistics.

Then this would say that those time series data for

a single jurisdiction, then, uh, we should see growth of

government if the pivotal voter becomes relatively poorer.

Namely, that pivotal voter has a.

Lower income share of the average income, then, uh, you

know, not clearly.

It's always as well identified, but people have looked at

time series and exploited reforms of the, uh, of the,

you know, electoral rules.

So eligibility has been changing.

And of course, in the early days, the income requirement

from voting in the US, you have to pay an

income tax.

And in many countries there was an income limit.

You were serious enough a citizen to participate politically, and

then you change that.

And that's, you know, again, assuming turnout goes along with

with that eligibility, then the pivotal voter gave the link

of holder with the pivotal voter would become relatively poor.

And we should expect that higher spending.

Yeah, we do see these things coinciding.

And we do see that a shift that is associated

closely with the reforms that I'm not.

So that's kind of, um, you get some insights, uh,

but not all of them borne out by.

The composition of government example is this can be very

rich.

Uh, you know, we don't have any predictions because there,

uh, for the reason of cycling that we already discussed.

We can find the Nash equilibrium.

Uh, you know, given this this vector of targeted spending

joking around in the game, how much like that we

don't find the rest point.

Um, that kind of existence problem was, uh, sort of

it's related to that paradox, uh, if you know about

that, it was the fatal problem in, in the early

literature and social choice and many people who went to

school now, they are not so many of them left,

uh, around, but to, you know, study these things in

the, in the 60s and 70s and they, they sort

of learned that political economics is an impossibility, uh, because,

yes, we we're looking for a voter outcome when things

are multidimensional, there are no median outcomes.

Or, you know, there's no no way that we can

study these issues.

So it happened to me in my beginning of my

career.

So when I started working on political economics, you know,

when you go to something like the, uh, or Econometric

Society at large, you meet someone over coffee and you

start talking and the, the gentleman or an elderly lady

and, and they ask us, what are you working on

with that?

Trying to work politically?

I think that's very hard.

Uh, you know, there are no equilibrium.

So.

That was the lesson, uh, in the early, early literature.

So what we.

Know here is, by the way, um, how do we.

We have until my preference, but you tell me otherwise.

It is to go to maybe half the time, then

take a substantial break and then that.

Okay.

Right.

Okay.

So so then we get to the next station on,

on this training thing of thinking, uh, on, on electric

competition, which I call probabilistic voting.

So in fact, this is a literature that has its

foundations in attempts to grapple with this, uh, problem, um,

that I just, uh, mentioned.

And this is a set of early work, uh, papers

by, I think the first penned by Melvin and Hynek

and people like Peter order sugar and others to work

on this in the in the 1970s.

Late 70s and early 80s.

Uh, and the, the basic idea in that literature was

to say, okay, so the the root of this existence

problem is that there is this huge discontinuity in the

probability of winning function.

I give you, uh, one that you give me another

and it jumps the probability of winning.

So what we ought to do is to somehow smooth

out those discontinuity.

And at the same time, it was sort of, uh,

work going on by McFadden and others that turned out

to be fundamental for econometrics, uh, which is based on

so-called random utility.

So there are shocks to People's preferences.

Uh, so firms would face, uh, a demand, uh, that

has some stochastic component.

And so here the idea is that when politicians design

their policy proposals they are facing, they are facing kind

of random.

I mean, because they are short to to the way

people look upon their performance on that in the mapping

from proposals to models.

And this way we can smooth out the and we

can solve this problem.

Okay.

Um, there is, uh, you know, the first people who

started taking this, uh, more seriously as a way to

think about political process is probably, uh, as a lean

back.

And your, your label, uh, uh, is now deceased.

is still working at the Stockholm School of Economics, a

Swedish couple.

So they published a paper in and in Public Choice

in 1999 where they sort of 87 perhaps some such

year where they proposed the the, the probabilistic voting model

as a as two to analyse redistribution and think about

it as a, you know, as a library piece rather

than a set theory.

Uh, these.

Um, so.

That's, uh, I already said these, but so how do

we implement this random utility idea from the viewpoint of

politicians?

We're going to assume, uh, following Linpack available and many

others that follow them.

Um, this is also exposed in the, in the in

the text.

So voters have some innate candidate body preferences.

But these innate preferences are, you know, a component of,

uh, that is not related to the policy proposals that

are being made.

Then those components are subject to both idiosyncratic popularity shocks

and popularity shocks.

So that's just shit happens in the electoral campaign.

And, um, yeah, we can always find an idiosyncratic component

by taking out the average component.

Uh, right.

So think about it in that way.

So formally think about a member of Group J before

it was just, uh, the policy preferences that we derived.

But now add a second part of utility.

That individual I that belongs to group J has uh

of life.

So I get the, the the utility according to policy

preference the policy preference.

But then they get an extra kick DB is an

indicator variable which is one if candidate B wins and

zero otherwise.

And then if that event happens, then there is an

extra kick or extra loss to this individual's utility.

Because sigma I j is this idiosyncratic?

Can be a positive number, can be a negative.

Uh, so that just gives me some utility.

And then there is a, you know, an average component

of that.

So uh, is delta is positive.

Then candidate B is generally more popular.

If it's negative B is generally less popular because people

have preferences over candidate.

So there are some attempts of deriving these things from

kind of what's known as non pliable policies.

Uh, you know, in here we mean maintaining the this

assumption that politicians can commit to a particular policy.

But maybe there are things, dimensional policy in which they

cannot commit or Kamala Harris, uh, cannot commit to supporting,

uh, a ban on abortion.

And people have different views of that, that that's one

of them to go in behind those preferences is really

about some different dynamics of poverty.

Some some countries are religious, others are not.

Some are men, some are women.

And therefore, you know, there will be there will be

like, I'm not going to pursue that here, I just

mentioned.

You know, of course it depends on the distribution of

those jokes.

So we're going to make very specific assumptions here, simplifying

assumptions so as to make the algebra as simple as

possible.

So let's look at the distribution of this sigma ij

uh it is in traffic shock uh across people inside

group J.

So let's draw a diagram.

This is sigma I j This is a frequency function.

This is zero.

So I'm going to assume that that this distribution is

uniform.

So it has a constant density.

And I'm going to assume that it's symmetric.

So it has a mean of zero.

So in particular it's going to.

Be.

Going to look something like this.

So this is going to be what I call it

minus one over two pi j.

And this is going to be one over two pi

j.

So this is imposing the symmetry.

This is imposing the, the uniformity.

Uh, and, uh, you can check that the now given

the properties of, of, uh, uh, this function, the the.

The the height of this distribution must be, uh, five

J multiplied by J with the, the length here, which

is one over five J and you get one, which

must be true.

Right.

That's just the property of the uniform distributions okay.

And now the popularity shock is also uniformly distributed and

symmetric but with the different density bending sign.

Okay.

So how does this, uh how do these shocks enter

what the timing is such that we want the politicians

to face this uncertainty when the policy choices, but of

course has to be realised before the election so that

they factor in this uncertainty into the into their calculus.

So parties will know the the distribution parameters, namely one

fee per group.

They will know the the distribution parameter of this aggregate

shock, but they don't know which person will have what

realisation of them.

You know, you're really, uh, sort of using the just

pure logic.

Then they could target policies to people who are positive

to them.

We don't allow that.

Just allow things to be targeted by group as before.

Right.

So they know this Distribution when they said gee, but

the shocks are realised before the election.

So now we're going to look at how politicians think

about each, uh, group.

And, um, what I want to do is to define

a swing voter in each one of the groups.

So who's the swing voter?

The swing voter is the one who is absolutely indifferent

between the two.

So move this to the side and this to that

side.

So this was the utility you get out of the

electing candidate B this is the one you get candidate

A and by this definition, um, I have defined where

this is different between the two candidates.

And that's Definition of the swing voter is very useful

because we can now approach how large the vote share

will get in body language.

So everybody with a realisation of the city is in

shock, but is smaller than the swing voters going to

support a because, you know, positive sigmas are preference for

B and everyone with a higher score.

So in this picture, if the swing voter.

Is this person, then the vote share of a party

is going to be.

Based.

Right.

Just the area of the surface.

Moreover.

That the vote share is going to depend on policy,

given that Sigma J was defined on the previous page.

Conditional on the policy promises that that that the two

candidates are made.

So by changing their policy promise, candidates can predictably affect

the future by moving the identity of the swing voter

in this group J.

And if you think about it already, now, that's going

to be a smooth function, because, you know, I'm affecting

on the margin in my policy terms.

I'm just including this swing voter little pad to the

right of the left.

so I'm going to affect my vote share, but in

a continuous fashion.

So we are somehow on our way towards identifying the

continuous problem.

So now.

Those vote shares are still groups specific, but we can

get an aggregate vote share by just summing them over

the groups with the relative group sizes.

So that will give us, you know, the probability that

A wins in the entire election.

And given that know how that vote share behaves as

a function of policy, we can derive an expression for

the probability of winning for the probability of that voucher

to be larger than half for candidate.

This is a good exercise.

I'm not going to do this derivation.

So whatever we did here and then use the definition

of the probability of winning which the probability did taken

over deltas and that the uh voucher is above one

half.

And you just gonna use 2 or 3 steps and

you will get this particular expression, which, uh, has one

half here.

So if this term was zero, then the probability of

winning one would be one half.

And see that trivially, given that this is how this

looks like, if they came up with the same policy

and the term would be zero, then they would have

the same probability of winning maybe one half.

Uh, then in terms of parameters, psi here is just

the density of that aggregate.

Uh uh.

So it comes from, from this, uh, probability.

And then phi is just the normal normalisation, which is

the sort of the average value of the densities of

these, uh, these different groups that we introduce the group

distributions.

But here.

So now let me make the argument, uh, more forcefully

to this is the probability of winning.

It is everywhere.

A continuous and concave function.

It's concave because from the viewpoint of candidate A, you

know, this is taken as given.

And I'm optimising.

And so WJ is a concave function.

So it must be a concave function.

It's a continuous function because these are continuous functions.

And it's kind of the argument that.

Before on the board before.

And that's true independently of the dimensional.

Whether g is a vector or whether g subscribe.

So this much holds in both examples that we are

entertaining.

So it's just to, to go and uh, and uh

okay.

So.

Uh.

Okay.

So yeah this is just saying.

So if we were to study electric computation mainly under

the Townshend assumption, uh, and the committee platforms and maximise

It's very ego expected.

Ego runs where the probability of winning is given by

the expression that you will learn how to derive.

Then we get an equilibrium where policy converges to a

unique convergent equilibrium, where both are candidates are offering the

same policy.

I call in that GP for this voting outcome because

the two parties have an identical decision problem.

Uh, you know, the.

Yes, if the A has the probability of winning, but

it takes GB as given.

So you know, maximise this uh, over this.

But then candidate B would have one minus P and

one minus P would uh invert these things.

And therefore, you know, when you take gas given you

identical problem because the WJ comes from the rotor sometimes

just.

Um.

So in order for this to hold, this holds on

definitely under the assumptions we are made, we have made

some assumptions, such as in particular make these distributions uniform.

If they weren't uniform, then we have to think about

how the, uh, you know, how this the densities behave.

We change policy.

And roughly speaking, the, you know, the densities cannot, uh,

undo the concavity of the, of the, of the decision

making problem.

So there's some.

Uh.

You know, uh.

Condition on On the on the likelihood, uh, functions and,

uh, the I think it's must be spelled out somewhere.

I always go to Steve Coates webpage.

He has lecture notes for political economy.

Of course.

Steve Coll is, uh, famous co-author, 2 to 3 in

the citizen candidate model.

He's at Cornell.

Uh, and he has a very clear exposition.

Uh.

Anyway, uh, another so we get policy convergence under plausible

conditions.

And then another kind of insight that is common to

these models, uh, is that once you look at what

the parties are doing here, they're maximising the probability of

winning.

That's a bit like maximising a weighted social welfare function.

You're taking every type of voter into account, uh, via

their policy preferences.

Uh, you're taking if it were, you know, a conventional

social planner, they wouldn't give a vote about this.

This Sigma JS uh, so this would be the utilitarian,

uh, objective.

Now, since these are political decision makers who only care

about winning, they, you know, it matters to them how

many swing voters there are in a given group.

If there are more swing voters, I give it a

larger way, um, because it's more conducive to helping me

win.

So that changes the weighting I make of different groups.

Some are more important to me in my my political

calculus.

Interestingly, in that process.

Even this, uh, this, uh, really, I take everyone into

account one way, maybe different ways that the society would.

As I said, this is a result independently of the

form and dimension.

Okay.

Now we can go to these, uh, specific examples and

let's take a break after I finish them.

So in the size of government, you know, uh, we

have only one thing to choose, namely the per capita

level of spending.

So now the two politicians have they have these probabilities

of winning.

So they would really like to appeal to the groups

with high densities.

Uh, but they have just one instrument.

So what they're going to do is to take more

into account the views of those, but they have a

lot to gain unless it's pretty blunt, but still we

can analyse it.

So we're going to push uh, level of, of government

towards the lowest point of those groups in this way.

So high alpha times so much.

And these groups are going to be politically powerful.

So formally, GA maximises probability to winning times ignorance given

JB by that objective function and the the probability of

winning a function that you will learn to derive.

We get a first order condition which says when I

jacked up g a little bit, uh, I'm going to

jack up the probability, I mean, the utility marginal utility

of government spending for everyone.

I'm waiting for those benefits, which are common because it's

a non-targeted policy with the with, uh, group prices and

these, uh, uh, swing voter densities.

I also have to take into account the cost of

doing so, and the cost is also affecting all groups.

So I'm sort of internalising the tax prices that, uh,

each group is paying and weighting them again.

Uh, like this.

This is the benefit.

This is the cost of the first order condition is

to equate that.

And we can rewrite this a little bit.

It's, uh, you know, you we want to get as

a first step.

We want to get this free on the left hand

side.

So let's take this expression and divide it over here.

But then this you recognise this is the definition of

average phi, which appeared in one of the, uh, one

of the formulas.

And uh, so we have the marginal utility of spending.

Equal to average phi in the denominator.

And then this stuff in the numerator which is a

weighted average of the tax prices.

And then we convert that relation and we get to

this uh expression closed form.

Given the that GP is equal to the g function

evaluated the y tilde over y where y tilde is

swing voter weighted tax price number.

So that's what we get.

And what's the point of that?

Now we can compare it to the median voter outcome.

And this equilibrium is potentially very different than what we

obtain in that setting.

So let's take the three three group example, uh, with

uh, the poor, the middle class and the rich, the

three groups.

And suppose for the sake of the argument that the

rich have more swing voters, uh, than average wise, the

poor have.

Fewer swing voters on average.

Now we'll go back to the definition of swing voter

weighted tax prices.

They include this slice.

So given this assumption, I'm going to operate the preferences

of the Rich.

I'm going to down.

Wait.

Preferences of the poor.

So in particular the y tilde.

The equilibrium of that here is going to be larger

than average income.

In the medium market model we have the median motors

relative to the average worker which is much lower.

So now in fact, uh, the level of spending uh,

is higher than, uh, the lower than we had before

and lower than the social optimal kind of defined.

I mean, if we do comparative statics, it depends on

exactly what change in the income distribution we are entertaining.

We can do, uh, a preserving spread.

Suppose we Reshuffle.

Income.

The average income is, uh, is constant.

But we do that by letting the income of the

rich go up and, uh, income of the median go

down, median motor model, uh, that would take government spending.

Uh, and uh, because the media motor got poor here,

it's going to take the, uh, that government spending go

down because go in the opposite direction.

So inequality cuts the level of spending because the stake

of these powerful rich holders is increasing.

So the the methodological implication here is clear.

So, you know, in, as I said in in the

early days of political economics, many people just.

Okay, so this is a problem.

It, uh, has a monotonic, uh, uh, policy preferences, you

know?

So so the controls are told.

So we apply the counter series.

Um, that's a lazy approach.

Uh, maybe this was not a an appropriate assumption.

Uh, and in particular, it sort of doesn't allow us

to think about, uh, you know, the mistakes of the,

of different groups and, uh, how it correlates with, uh,

with their propensity to vote.

For.

Different candidates.

So I'm not saying that this needs to be the

case, um, but that we get a different result, but

we could very well get it.

And in particular, some of these things are eminently measurable.

So we know the preference is to some degree of,

uh, rich and poor and from various voting surveys such

as the National Election Surveys have been run in 20

countries for 60 years.

We have some preference distributions across different groups in society,

in particular for different income holders.

So it's not as if this, uh, you know, measurement

is impossible in that sense.

This is a productive expansion of the model because it's

definable, observable, and not just the illusory theoretical cost.

If we do the composition of government.

We don't have a reference point because in the media

motor, um, model or the dancing model, we didn't have

a, have a, have an equilibrium here.

We do have an equilibrium.

Um, uh, what's the properties of that equilibrium?

Well, now the government has this array of tools, a

whole toolbox, you know, one instrument or group.

And now the difference between the politically attracted groups and

the not so politically attractive groups can be, uh, approached

with greater, uh, granularity, uh, by the government, by targeting

these, these policies or these parts of the policy vector

different way.

So, um, so we're going to target to these powerful

groups in the sense of, in a sense to be

shown here.

So formally, I'm going to choose this policy vector as

candidate A to maximise my probability of winning given the

probability of winning function that is still applies.

But now the first order condition for each group because

for each component of this vector, and it's going to

have one benefit, namely for that group increase their spending

benefit and they benefit alone.

So internalise only their their marginal benefit, weighting them with

their with their size and their political, uh, convenience uh

parameter.

On the other hand, in this composition of government finances,

uh, right.

So this is the head tax.

So everyone, uh, carries a cost.

Uh, so I internalise all those costs, summing over those

groups that the costs are going to be proportional to

alpha J, which is the size of group J, because

that's how much I have to come up with at

the margin, uh, is higher.

And and it's a big group.

So now you see that the size parameter, it's sort

of knocks out from the, from the marginal deficit and

the marginal cost.

And what we end up with if we just divide

two by sigma on this side is uh, this expression,

why am I deduct one from each side.

So I have phi the average pi over two pi

j.

But I divide it down here and then I take

away one pi j minus one.

So this kind of you remember, was the kind of

social optimum.

Or, you know, when each group pays the average cost

themselves.

Uh, and this is the departure from that, uh, and

it's easy to see that for, for groups who have,

um, Uh, a phi j that is larger than average.

And this must become a negative number for those that

have a Phi J that is smaller than average.

And this becomes a positive number.

So I am supplying over supplying the groups with a

high density.

I'm under supplying to the groups.

Of swing voters.

That's what it says.

And there's also notice that the relative group size doesn't

play any role in this setting because, uh, costs and

and benefits and both the benefit and the cost in

this linear model turned out to be linear in our

pages.

Um, and let me finish before the break with what

I call methodological implication number two, that this was this

is just prediction.

And we can again go to measurable quantities.

And the is in the somehow that carried out in

the in the showcase example why it was hard to

do political economics.

It's not very difficult to get a well-defined outcome here

even if we don't have.

Okay.

So this is a lot.

But maybe we can we can take 20 minutes.

Uh, break.

We're going.

Sometimes people are.

Just shy to stop.

Oh.

Yeah, yeah.

Maybe.

I'm doing something right.

It was supposed to be like the motivated reasoning.

It's a little context.

Yeah.

So I'm thinking about going along as well.

Yeah.

This is like.

Uh.

So.

Yeah.

Alexa.

What's next?

I'm not sure.

Yeah, probably.

I'm not sure.

Yeah.

Right.

Yeah.

So?

So, you know what?

Uh, are you going to, uh, coffee also?

Yeah.

Okay.

Coffee afterwards.

Allows them to commit.

What are you from?

That is.

Useful, right?

I mean, you know.

If you believe that the.

Income differences in.

Income.

During transatlantic has a lot of then you're going to

spend more effort which may be useful.

Yeah.

Yeah.

No, it's only like, uh, if they have a preference

for some possibility like coffee and even they have information

about that possibly wrong with, uh, if they have the

information from the telling them the opposite way, kind of

give them what I tell you.

If we give them the information, I tell you that's

not really aligned with their preference or their political stance.

They may kind of put those weights on those kind

of skills, Nicola said.

Okay, so.

That kind of motivated.

Okay.

Yeah.

No, no I understand.

I thought you meant to tell us.

Yeah.

Yeah I just.

But yeah, I'm just thinking maybe.

So I'm kind of exploring it, right?

Where are you working?

Um.

But it's good to be.

Have you cross back and stuff?

Yeah.

Yeah.

So?

So why?

So why?

I kind of, like, wanted doing this.

Like, it's always like I want something to go.

All right.

With the development.

Yeah.

You know.

Yeah.

So.

So I always tell them, you know, and and I

think the government is like many, many researchers talking about

like.

Like.

Like there we go.

But like when I look at it, I think I

think some of it.

They've been doing some research.

Even when we keep that focus, they do everything during

the short run by the wrong kind of deal.

But maybe it's because they are affected by the abuse

like the well.

So I'm thinking, okay, so I'll have want to.

Use insights from social economics here as well.

So yeah.

It's.

Just a matter of.

Finding the right project.

Yeah.

Well.

Thank you.

Very much.

It's a good day.

Anything is even worse.

Yeah.

So it's like, I always, like, expose myself to different

opportunities.

Yeah.

That's good.

Okay.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Okay.

So.

The university.

Uh, all I'm thinking.

Oh.

Uh.

Excuse me.

No.

Seriously speaking.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

But then, uh, a lot of.

Times.

Um, after the.

bike.

Well, then you go.

Yeah.

It makes a.

Hell of.

A mad good thing.

Look at this thing.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I'm an.

Instructor.

Oh.

Yeah, I.

See the guy.

Um, to get the.

Owner there.

Yeah.

Okay.

So, uh.

Now let's get to this guy.

Um.

Uh.

The poor people and.

You know, the idea of.

Talking to commerce.

And.

SoundScan.

And the ticket item.

And all of that.

Well I will know tomorrow.

Yeah.

Oh the.

Major side.

Mhm.

Mhm.

Yeah.

Uh.

We didn't I don't think I.

Did uh I don't think it'll get supported then I

don't know.

Yeah.

Well I think this.

Is uh.

This is something that you should say, let's Safety.

Yeah.

Um.

Centrafrique.

Okay.

Yeah.

You're going to say not so.

I'm not getting too much response.

You know, I still rap about Sasha.

Vanilla.

You know.

Yeah.

It's obviously going to put up an.

Idea for me.

At Moscow.

And then the downside is.

So, uh.

So intelligent strategy.

Uh.

Um.

I'm sorry.

Yeah.

You know, those are preference preferences that predict based Bella.

Bella.

Yeah.

So I'm responsible for.

Because it's.

So bad for inequality.

So do like some take it for.

Uh, you.

Know, some.

Magic or some sort.

Of claim to me.

I think this blue collar someone is.

Is someone high?

The cost of the pursuing the inequality.

Uh, you know, sector, uh, you know, one of the

spots, uh, you know.

Within my might.

Think.

Yeah.

They, they go into the omen into, you know, the

cap and the.

Yeah.

This.

Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

It's almost by force.

So so so no, that is not something.

That is going.

To.

Be and also.

You're going to see if you then uh, you know

would say I'm the are you the.

Um any survey is um.

Care more about.

The quality and so about the need for.

That.

Uh, could you answer those questions?

Uh, some of your some.

Of.

What?

My, uh, personal.

Question.

For me and some, uh.

Uh.

I don't have.

The.

Yeah.

No.

Uh.

Marketing.

Favourable.

Uh.

Come on.

Come on, come on.

Yeah yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

Uh uh, I think I know.

I don't know what the, uh, policy for, but.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

I don't I.

Don't.

Really have to shop at the centre not to was

an awesome yo yo yo.

Make some faeces.

Look at all the.

Uh, all the matter and stuff.

There's a lot of housing.

So that last election.

Somehow, someway, somehow.

I don't think.

There's anything like that at all.

I mean, yeah, if it's going to be good for.

Some.

Okay, I.

Know.

Okay.

And he also had some Csec out there on the

informant.

Yeah.

Some information.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Well, yeah.

But there wasn't any economic for them.

Not really.

Yes.

Like some places.

Uh.

Alexander.

Uh, did you know that?

Did you say I'm doing the experiment?

Should I do that?

Yeah.

Yeah.

So we installed that.

So you ready?

I, I just, I just.

Thought that it was prolific.

So I do a very high level pilot for like

30 years, but this.

Is the pilot.

So I didn't pilot.

So, you know.

I was like, I don't get it.

And then they also tried.

Again.

Yeah.

So you still have.

It, right?

Yeah.

Two weeks.

Yeah.

Two weeks.

Oh, it's three weeks for.

You, baby.

You made me nervous.

Yeah, it's more like really tough stuff.

So if I worry about it, like I Just to

make everything right.

Oh.

That's cool.

We.

Should be finished by then.

You probably read it, right.

Like that's gonna.

Shouldn't be the problem with the writing.

So I put, like, a proposal recently.

Yeah, I have, like, experiment, but let me just say

so, like, it's, you know, and so they need to

go back to university or whatever it is.

I'll go.

Yeah.

That's for for you for UCL at some point.

So yeah.

So there will be research in that.

So.

It's kind of important And then.

I did like July 31st this year.

So.

That was expected to be the same.

So.

How large is the contract?

How long are we using?

Is it small at all?

Yeah, it's very small, uh, depending on course, but it's

more.

But the whole core of the whole problem.

You know, my cohort is very large.

It's like 40.

Or 40?

40.

That's great.

But normally I think like this after I mean, now

the Reds coming in, I think they're all certain it's.

Yeah, it's really what I think.

Your call.

Yeah yeah.

Yeah.

So that's for.

Yeah.

Yeah.

So that's more like hi.

Yeah.

Like give me here.

Like like this is like 15.

But they're like all the subject variance including mark on

everybody.

So for each department like 3 or 4 but all

the different like.

And how.

Is there a.

Common course.

Yeah I think there's kind of like quantitative approaches that

we take for example like.

Come on.

And then everything else.

There are subjects and classes, but like my econometric service

or all that one and the others, there is also

one other language.

So you guys and.

This department and.

This kind of.

Thing and your work.

Yes I agree.

You know, I don't.

Know what you're.

Interested in, but it seems to me that somehow.

I'm exploring politics.

But.

As you know, there are many people.

In firms.

You know, there are conflicts of interests that they have

to.

Think about is centralisation.

You know.

The centralisation is you only decentralised is if.

Perspective is that you.

Share your interests.

You know, even though it's efficient and stable.

Okay.

But like the firm or like, yeah, very many institutions

that cover the firm, some of them or something like

Life is.

The same way as the way we did in this

whole subject.

I talked.

About this.

But there's not a lot of there's.

Not a lot of.

Uh.

We have, um.

A team that has a research program on the whole

sort of culture of evolution and societies that have.

Ideas about.

Values.

And we have one paper just for, you know, which

is.

About.

You know, corporate culture or organisational culture.

Sorry about that.

Besides, it's exactly.

How we should work out the dynamics of interaction with

such organisations.

Approaches.

Centralisation.

Then they feed back each other.

So it's just an example of such cross-fertilisation.

Maybe it's just.

Been imperialism applying similar ideas.

But honestly, I'm.

I'm interested in even like, right now what could be

some kind of small or medium size?

How the culture change after they go through these kind

of like trainings.

Like how do they get the idea?

You know, I IBM was.

Of course.

Mainframe giant.

Completely.

But they also.

Recruited a lot of people.

So I think that that PC era.

You know, those values.

Are so conducive to that.

To that.

For them, you know.

So.

I think.

That's one way.

You can.

Just.

Be somewhere.

Yeah.

Thank you.

Yeah.

That's a that's the kind of things.

This kind of hospitalisation.

Yeah.

So there's not a lot of people thinking that this

is.

Oh, hi.

So you're still mad?

So, um.

Let us, um, conclude.

I think I have 13 slides to go, so this

should be fine.

Okay, so next up is to think about interest groups.

So, you know, up to now, the only political forces

were the, uh, the politicians who make the policy and

the, the.

To.

Support them.

Don't support.

Them.

But of course, that's not everything.

And uh, uh, interest groups, uh, organise um is an

important aspect of many political systems.

So, um.

I'll show you a very simple example here.

Which is adapted to this problem electoral competition, how interest

groups sort of figure prominently in in many.

Subfields, uh, where, you know, policymaking is thought about as

affecting, uh, targeted interest.

And maybe the typical example is international economics and international

trade, you know, subsidies or or or tariffs or general

support of firms across sectors.

So there's a big literature from from 20, uh, years

ago starting using the the menu auction model of Bernheim

and Winston to to think about.

Um, uh, influence activities by firms and, you know, and

I have Jean Grossman and I have a number of

papers and a book about, uh, about that, that some

of you may have.

Seen.

It in some course and in that setting, you know,

interest groups or model that's trying to influence the policy

activity of the policy setting process.

Um, here I'm going to take another approach, which is

more like drawing on, uh, first paper by David Meyer.

Nice, well known political scientist, now retired, but still kicking

at Stanford.

Um.

Uh, where interest groups are more like supporting the, the

parties, uh, or individual politicians.

Whose.

Our policies look more appealing to them.

So it looks like a very different approach.

Are trying to influence policy setting, or once policy has

been set, to support those that give you the best

outcome.

Turns out that it's not so, so different after all,

because the in a forward looking setting, you anticipate the

setting of policy bodies.

And so.

You'll see.

And anyway this is what I do here is the

spectrum uh, goes back to 1994.

Very simple setting.

So take the probabilistic voting model that we now know

how it works roughly, or at least I've told you

how it works.

So take that model we just had and extend it,

uh, with interest groups.

But in order to to see the difference that interest

groups make as such, I'm going To sort of nullify

the forces that we have emphasised so far.

In particular, I'm going to assume that these densities have

made different groups differentially important in the eyes of of

politicians.

You know, they are the same across groups.

Um, so.

Because there is no bias then then, you know, the,

uh, the, uh, the policies would be socially optimal in

the absence of law because politicians have the probabilistic voting

model maximising a social weighted social welfare function.

Now, the weights are just the sizes.

And for the sizes, let's assume that they are equal,

uh, across groups.

So this is this assumption is uh, they are just

to simplify the algebra.

So this is to highlight this option is to highlight

that the novel is of interest group, and this is

make it simple to sort them, because now we have

political competition.

We have probabilistic voting because our interest groups need to

make some pedagogical assumptions.

Moreover, I'm not going to study the formation of interest

groups.

Uh, I'm going to take, uh, existing interest groups as

given.

There is a literature on that two.

Uh.

First paper by Ashish Mitra, ah, 1999, about the cost

of benefits of forming in interest groups such.

But I'm not going to go there.

I'm just going to say that some of these groups

J or and some or not.

So there's an indicator o j that is equal to

one for an organised group and equal to zero for

a non.

normal amount.

What does it mean to be organised?

It means to have solved some collective action problem, so

that you have set up a mechanism for giving, uh,

campaign support to politicians whose policies you drink.

Okay, so.

Let each group, uh, J potentially give contribution to candidates.

So large C is how much, uh, how large a

campaign contribution group J gives to candidate C?

It only does.

So if uh, the group is, uh, organised.

Otherwise doesn't give anything.

Uh, and then, you know, each group has size alpha.

So this sum here now adds up to the total

resources of candidates he gets from cash contributions from organised

groups.

Right.

LLC.

How will this game be played?

Well, it's like this electoral game, but groups are going

to set per capita lobbying levels ultimately after, uh, the

policy proposals have been announced.

That's the better assumption.

Yeah.

They make the contributions to those whose policies they like

best.

But it's going to be set before these idiosyncratically, uh,

voting shocks are realised.

Then we also have to pay for campaign contributions to

play a role.

Uh, obviously they have to influence Something.

So money must have a role in politics.

Uh, think about this.

Money.

Money or campaign contributions?

In-kind.

Maybe knocking at doors or whatever.

Must have some some influence.

So think about it in the following way.

This common popularity shop that we call Delta now has

two components.

One is delta tilde.

Delta tilde is just a stochastic shock like the one

we studied before.

But then there is a systematic component which is h

parameter h dot function h uh times lv minus l.

So this is the total spending that candidate B can

afford.

This is the total spending candidate can afford the difference

between them.

Bring some electoral advantage uh to candidate B which we

sort of map to this, uh, space of populations.

What is this reduced form?

Be good to derive it from some more fundamental assumptions

about cognitive impairments or behaviour.

Something like, you know again.

Yeah.

You can't do everything.

So, uh, and let's assume that delta tildes uniform with

density shine in the same way as delta was before.

So now we can repeat the process.

We define a swing motor in J uh, that is

indifferent between the two candidates.

And it's just, uh, this, uh, previous definition augmented by

these gifts.

Okay.

So now doing the same derivation, we can derive the

probability of winning, uh, for candidate AS1 half plus previous

This function now amended with these relative campaign contributions.

And if at A has more resource than B, then

she has a higher probability one half, meaning for the

rest.

It depends on these policy choices.

But we're not done here because of course these are

equilibrium objects.

You know how much is given.

Uh, depends on how the, uh, how much the lobbies

like the two policies.

So how do the each lobby is that set, their

set their contribution to each candidate?

Well, I'm going to assume that they maximise the utility

of the typical member.

And um, so that's going to be uh, this which

is the probability of winning that uh, of candidate a

utility.

My group gets a candidate as policy.

Just the complementary probability times the utility of candidate B's

policy.

And then there has to be some cost of giving,

uh, these, uh, these contributions, which I'm assuming are quadratic.

That looks a little bit inconsistent because I assume that

if there were a gift, you know, utility is linear

in consumption.

So why isn't this linear.

But it's not linear because then we would have a

bang bang solution conducive.

So I give some curvature by my by making these

costs increasing in contributions.

If you want to you can interpret this as an

effort cost.

It's not really cash.

It's uh, you know, some trade union members go around

and knock at the door of the Labour, uh, prospective

Labour voter, something that's costly and it's more costly.

The more they have, the worse they have to go.

Yeah.

Anyway.

Uh.

Of course I do it for just to get a

simple solution.

So.

That this is done, uh, before these, uh, shocks are

being realised.

And because these groups are, these, um, shocks are symmetric

and expected.

It is interesting and common shocks are going to integrate

out.

And that's the reason why we don't see anything about

those expected shocks here.

So given.

This thing uh.

It is for the for the group.

The group is not them.

Even though each person, uh, in the group is an

atom, you know, the groups realise that they can influence

the probability of winning for the candidate they support because,

you know, if it's a decently sized group, they can

discretely make a difference in the electoral campaign, push the

probability of winning up for that candidate.

So they take this into account.

The fact that their contribution affects candidates or candidates, uh,

likelihood of winning.

And so you get this solution, which looks very complicated,

but it just says that Group J is going to

pay only to the candidate who has a preferred platform,

and it's going to pay an amount that is, uh,

proportional to the utility.

The difference between that candidate.

Yeah.

And uh, yeah.

So that's.

Uh, what you get.

And now we generally sorry for the lengthy, uh, start

up here.

Uh, we get to the optimal platforms for, for the

candidate because now we can rewrite the probability winning that

we had before.

It involves these campaign contributions, some overall groups that showed

how each group picks its, uh, picks its contribution.

So sum those and stick them into the into the

probability of winning.

And we get, uh, get those out and we get

the following, uh, expression closed form for the, for the

probability of winning for candidate.

So it's the usual one half in the absence of

policy differences and in the probabilistic voting model proper, we

had uh, uh, alpha J Vijay primes Vijay.

I've nullified out those things because we assume that they

are the same across groups.

So there is way.

But with the new weight here, we get the weight

on each group which is one plus gamma times OJ

and OJ.

Is this organisational indicator?

Are you organised or not?

What's gamma?

Gamma is a composite parameters that kind of measures the

clout of multiple.

So if, if uh.

Now I'm looking forward to setting policy, I realise that

my policy is going to strike differently across different groups,

uh, groups of the same size.

So everything else equal, I'm going to get everyone the

same benefits.

But now some groups are going to help me win.

If they are organised, they're going to respond by giving

me a money kickback.

Uh, which is going to help me make it easier

for me to win, which is my goal in life

because my objective is to maximise, uh, expected value.

So I gave more to the organised groups than I

give to the more organised groups.

That's what this is say about me.

Uh.

And, um, how how will this play out in equilibrium?

Well, uh, you know, B is going to have a

symmetric problem.

It's just that we have to change one minus p,

and then we get the flip WJ and flip this

against each other.

But as in the probabilistic voting model, uh, two parties,

two candidates are facing the same problem.

It's a concave problem because WJ is concave.

I got to pick the same, uh, solution, but a

different one is.

Uh, potentially.

And here is the subtle.

Point.

That, uh, you know, I'm making it impossible here, but,

uh, you know, they there are reputed, uh, scholars who

say who maybe has an ideological, uh, uh, idea and

talent is, uh, is a quote that, you know, so

important that interest groups look at the, the, uh, amount

of money that is changing hands in, in American politics

is trivial given the policy, uh, advantages that are at

stake.

So, you know, cannot be a very important phenomenon empirically.

This is well known scholars pronouncing.

but it's missing a point that, you know, there's what

you see.

Changing hand in equilibrium is what you see.

Changing hands is the equilibrium outcome.

You know how the equilibrium behaviour drives what happens in

equilibrium and in particular in this setting.

As we shall see, nothing matters for the outcome.

Yet the two parties offer the same policies to the

same policies.

In equilibrium there is no money that is uh, uh,

being transferred to them.

But that doesn't mean that lobbying is unimportant.

It influences how that equilibrium works, which is kind of

only an economist can or, you know, a scholars that

are trained in this kind of, uh, Equilibrium thinking can

come up, but, uh.

Yeah, you you, uh, you get it, uh, or you

will be more or less impressed.

Of course, in this less stylised model, the two markets

are not equally popular.

They're not symmetric assumptions.

So then some money will change.

So at the same time we'll, uh, we'll see some,

uh, sort of non-zero transfers taking place that's sort of

ruled out by simplifying assumptions.

But the same point remains that, uh, you know, out

of equilibrium behaviour still dictate.

So.

Okay, so what happens?

Well, if there are different possibilities, some of them, if

no one is organised and you can get the same

solution that's socially optimal.

Not Surprising.

If everyone is organised and all groups do the same

thing, they get the same way and same solution.

So interesting case is when some groups are organised and

other groups and topics.

Uh.

Um.

Depends in different ways in, in these two different policy

examples.

So now let me go to the size of government.

What's the equilibrium provision of uh public goods.

Okay.

So take the first order condition then that's going to

satisfy the following condition.

So again the g function evaluated at tax price.

Modified tax price is not swing voter weighted.

It's lobby weighted.

So.

my cat is going to is this, uh, number here?

It's the tax price obtained by, um, by each group

or paid by each group, uh, augmented by this organisation.

Um.

And again, we can play this game, uh, that the

size of government now reflects and only reflects the organisation

of interest groups because I assume the way all the

other channels.

So take the three group examples and assume that the

rich have been organised or organised, the poor and the

middle class or not.

Then you get bigger way on the, on the on

the riches preferences.

And uh, you know, the, the equilibrium level of spending

is smaller than socially optimal one and certainly smaller than

it was in the media centre.

But then you get more curious again.

Overturned.

Oppositional government.

Oh, we're doing different things to different groups.

But the only thing that separates groups now here is

whether they are organised or whether they are not.

So we will get two equilibrium conditions for the groups

that are organised, one for the groups that are normally

denies.

And not surprisingly, we right this deviation from the from

the average here.

Uh, we had a negative thing on the right hand

side for the organised groups, meaning that we oversupplied those

groups and will under supply to groups that.

The groups.

With uh.

Organise get better treatment because we are prepared to pay

on the margin for policy and as a result.

They get.

Your attention.

Okay.

I think that's the.

Basic bottom line.

Final station here on the on our journey today is

to go to differential, uh, political objectives.

So suppose politicians now not motivated solely by, by.

Uh.

Winning but by.

Uh, by.

You know.

Policy orientation.

And they have outright policy preferences in the same way

as.

The citizens, huh?

So this this this is a big part of the

literature.

When we look at ideologically motivated.

Politicians.

And how they compete with each other.

Equilibrium.

So let me start and we'll we'll make our assumption

throughout next week's lecture.

Uh, let me anticipate a little bit of that.

So let me first show you, uh, uh, another result

where ideologically motivated politicians have no affect, get the, uh,

same outcome as before.

So how can we get policy convergence?

Uh, even though there are two candidates with a very

different, uh, policy preferences.

So let's now confine ourselves to this one dimensional size

of government example.

a simple model with a Condorcet winner and a discrete

income distribution.

And let's assume voters have no candidate preferences.

So.

Forget about the probabilistic voting model for just one second.

And now assume that there are citizen candidates in in

a kind of volunteer setting.

Again, I didn't talk about citizen candidates.

Yeah.

Or she did.

Okay.

Very good.

So then you know what citizen candidate is.

So let's you have seen this.

I'm going to assume that there are two standing candidates,

and they sort of adopt the preferences of someone with

income.

YJ.

So maybe you know, they are.

It's not that they are selfishly maximising preferences, but they're

representing a particular group and exactly why they do that.

Of course there would be a party behind, you know,

studying that right here.

And so we just saying that the candidate candidate see

the preferences of someone with relative income or tax price,

why see everyone as opposed that?

This to the two candidates is one candidate for the

poor, one candidate for the rich.

And they have given ideal points on opposite side of

the median voters, so that this time for the poor

party or the poor candidate is poorer than the median

person in society, the richer one is richer.

As a result, the poor candidate wants more than the

median, and the rich candidate wants less than right.

They can still do binding commitment to platforms to maximise

their expected utility, which is not expected but their expected

utility given those as policy preference.

Not, of course, when the maximise expected utility voters uh

behaviour, uh is going to dictate the probability of winning

for the two parties and candidates.

Um, if you think about it, once the the candidates

have offered.

These policies to voters.

They have committed.

So then no matter where the promises come from, uh,

for the voters, it's just a choice between these two

policy platform.

Right.

Which is going to give them more latitude.

And they believe the commitment because they can be irrevocable.

So notwithstanding, whether one candidate represents the poor and one

can represent the rich.

What matters now in this static election is only what

they offer in terms of the of the fiscal policy.

So our previous discontinuous probability of winning is going to

apply because I know shocks across.

The.

US the candidate is now.

So again the medium prefers the rich candidate's proposal to

the poorer candidates for candidate has zero probability of winning

opposite.

If it's the opposite situation.

And is this 5050 if the median is indifferent?

Candidates now maximise their expected utility, which is, you know,

the expected payoff figure.

Candidate P save the poor one.

Given what candidate the rich candidate offers, which is uh,

sort of the default outcome is that the rich candidate

wins and I get that.

But then I get a surplus, which is the probability

that I win and I get my utility out of

my proposed policy, minus the utility of the other guy's

policy.

So this is the surplus from waiting before or it's

p times that.

Times one minus p times.

Yeah.

How you how have you.

However I do face this probability of winning now, stare

at that a little bit and think.

Now suppose that the rich candidate, as we might expect,

um.

Offers, uh, a level of spending that is smaller than

what the media, what the optimal behaviour for me as

a, as a war camp is to leave my bliss

point.

But I don't want to leave my bliss point very

much because I do like, uh, large government.

So I set, uh, a low enough, uh, proposal that,

uh, is close enough for the medium ones.

My probability of winning is one.

So that will, you know, be some convergence towards the

medium, but I'll converge just over converge line.

More popular than the rich candidate's proposal in the eyes

of the world.

But then I'm doing that.

Then if you're the rich candidate, then you have adopted

us.

So your incentive is to leave the media at this

point a bit more, just to take over those that

probability of winning.

And as you can see, that, uh, process sort of

quasi converges to to the point where we both.

Propose the immediate.

So we get the policy convergence.

So now we get the same outcome as we did

with opportunistic politicians, even though politicians are very ideologically mocked

and potentially might power us.

And its strong assumptions give strong conclusions.

That's so the intuition is that as long.

Yeah.

This is what precisely what what we were saying.

Uh, so at any point where the median is indifferent,

uh, between my policy and, and her policy, then I

do a little bit closer to the centre.

And that gives me, uh, a, an infinitesimal loss in

terms of, you know, going away from my bliss point,

uh, to the first order and a discrete gain, because

I get, you know, go from zero to to one

probability of winning.

And, uh, therefore they cannot be any other.

Uh, outcomes.

So again, can't get convergence with, uh, with, uh, partisan

motivations.

Uh, and For a while, you know, this was considered,

uh uh, okay.

It shows that it's a general result.

Uh, once you have the median voter object, it's really

matter, uh, how.

Important it was.

The somehow the received wisdom for a decade or or

a little more.

But then it doesn't seem very, very plausible.

You know, the policy outcome here depends only on voter

preferences.

It's independent of the identity of the ruling party, which

is wildly counterfactual.

Even if you find yourself, did you want to what

existence so implicitly.

So now when does this result fail?

And, uh, there are two circumstances under which it fails

in terms of generalities.

One is when competition is less fierce, that the discontinuity

in this probability winning function is not so stark.

And the second one is when candidates kind of let

me go through those entire quickly.

So the first one that would be political competition with

probabilistic voting.

You already saw.

So you can take the model from section C in

the slide.

Or you can it's an exercise in chapter five of

the text that sort of works.

This ask you to work this out.

And the common commonality is that the probability of winning

responds continuously to the spending promise is now of this.

Level level of spending.

So we're going to be able to derive a first

order condition for each candidate, which has two components.

And now these can involve derivatives because there are uh

it's continuous functions that are being maximised.

So on the one hand if you have support for

candidate a level of spending, uh, you get a, uh,

utility gain because you are increasing your own utility.

As long as you're below your, your base point, you

weight that with your probability of winning.

On the other hand, there is a cost because if

you jack up the level of spending, you move further

from the from the, the central tendency.

So in general this will be a negative, uh, function.

And you know, with that, with uh.

With uh, with a.

Cut in surplus if you lose rather than a gain.

Now, if it if we were at a point where

the two parties offered the same policy, then this first

term would be positive.

Uh, and the second term would be negative because there

would be zero, because this is a zero term.

Uh, so that cannot be an equilibrium converging.

Instead, uh, we have to look for something like, you

know, I offer something more than the average solution, and,

uh, or the median solution, and the rich offers something

less.

And if that's true, then the first term is still

positive, and the second term is now going to be.

And I'm going to wait till Whales.

Against each other.

And so I'm going to be able to find the,

uh, a point at £0.04 is is equal to zero

where I'm above.

Uh.

This average optimal policy.

And then I can repeat.

But of course that's contingent on some, some behaviour by

the, by the other party.

Now I repeat the process for the other party.

And I'm going to make the same argument.

And eventually I can find a pair of policies that

satisfy both first order conditions.

And those first order conditions will have the properties that,

uh, you know, the, the right wing candidate lives or

bliss point, but doesn't go fully to the centre, The

left wing candidate leaves her bliss point but doesn't go

fully to the centre, so we get the non convergent

equilibrium with the with the plausible properties that that yeah,

that ideal that governs, uh, what you offer.

Uh, that's optimal behaviour for both campaigns.

And the intuition is I have gotten it by now

that the probability of winning falls slowly when candidates leave

the centre, so they can trade off that effect against

the, uh, that preferred preferred policy that comes from the

ideology.

Of course.

You know, so now the partisan political, uh, electoral competition

expanded with the electoral vote.

Now, suppose we as before, we expanded it also with

lobby.

Uh, so I'm not going to do anything formally here.

I'm just gonna, uh, appeal to your intuition.

It's actually, uh, one of the more famous, uh, unpublished

papers is a paper by Alison and Horton, and we

are working paper from 20 something.

Um, and I understand why it's unpublished.

Because, I mean, the beginning is the end of the

paper is a mess.

But the beginning of the paper, they have this little

model of, of a.

Of.

Interest groups and ideologically motivated models, and it's kind of

a, uh, went down, as always, when our back to

this involved was involved in modelling.

It is a weekly done.

And basically what comes out is depends on which you

know, where these interest groups are located.

So think about the intuition from the interest group model

we had before.

Now these interest groups are going to pay to the

project that they like best.

Now, if the interest groups, uh, represent people that are

poorer than the and, uh, and the.

Preferences of the of the party on the left.

And if the interest groups that are organised have represent

groups that are richer than the, the, the typical member

of the rich body, then they exercise a polarising influence,

because the left sees the possibility of getting some funds

from those leftists, and the right team sees the possibility

of getting some funds from the rightists.

So they are going to push policy in that direction,

increasing the weight of those groups.

That's like what we did in the probabilistic voting model.

They don't use exactly the same language.

But, you know.

The.

Kind of economic political competition is, is, is clear enough.

But if you know, the the interest groups represent groups

over the spectrum, then that can be a more like

a centralising that.

So that was one possibility.

The other possibility is that we don't have policy commitments.

So this is really what, uh, Alberto and I just

mentioned, uh, sort of worked on in his thesis.

So this is the 1986 thesis from Harvard.

Um.

Deaf access.

This advisory is one of Jeff's few.

Few, uh, uh, PhD.

Candidates.

You know.

Jeff Sachs.

And, uh, leader of the Art Institute and a famous,

uh.

Uh.

Someone who started out as a regular, uh, macroeconomists at

the time.

But then he became a travelling salesman in ideas.

And, uh, so he, he was really in his office,

and so few people wanted to have him as an

advisor.

And that was attracted by my Jeff and his smartness.

And so, so happened.

And that went and that was working on his thesis.

And the critical moment Jeff fell on his doorstep and

broke his leg, uh, tragically.

You know, he was in the plasters for, for six

weeks and during those six weeks talked about because he

was nailed to his.

Its story is that story is bad.

And they even wrote their joint paper.

So.

These things happen anyway.

So.

But so what I did was that he he saw

that, you know, there had been all this tradition of

writing down electoral competition.

Models.

With opportunistic politicians that could commit.

Now there was a literature on partisan politics, partisan motivated

politics, but either was not, you know, very well versed

in theory or perhaps this probabilistic voting result was there,

but they assumed commitment to politics.

I'm assuming commitment to have become more or less like

a if you repeat an example enough times.

So it becomes like an axiom.

Everyone had that vaccine.

But then and maybe, you know, once you have opportunistic

politicians, it's such a bad assumption because if you're motivated

by winning the election, you win the election.

You have made a promise, then that is not such

a big deal to fulfil the promise.

But I mean, it's consistent with your or exposed objectives,

at least weekly, so might as well what I promised

because I copied my prize.

Not so in this case where politicians are partisan motivated.

Suppose we get this convergent equilibrium.

We have both promised to be in the middle and

now one of one of us wins.

And, you know, we have to carry out that policy.

Now, there's a tension between our example promises and our

exposed preferences, which is like credibility problem And that kind

of problem was the same kind of credibility problem as

the one children in Prescott and Borden pointing to.

It's coming at this from the macro.

Faith.

And, you know, Alberto saw that and, uh, and worked

on it, worked it out.

Sorry.

Wrong background story.

But it also gives you a little bit of the

evolution of, uh, so suppose the, you know, this is

a static model, then what's the what's the best thing

for me to do exposed.

If I win, it's to carry out my, my response

because that's what exposed optimises my payoff.

And unless there is a continuation somehow, uh, that's what

I want to do.

And therefore the only credible policies for the two bodies

are I respected this point.

Then, you know there would be a probability of winning.

Uh, that depends on whether the media likes those sports

more or less.

Okay, so that would be a very simple, very simple,

uh, point.

That's not the point.

They published one of this chapters in the QG and

the other in the.

I wouldn't have done that.

Just that.

Means.

Then they say, okay, but maybe there are some, some

forces that still provide some, uh, some sort of, uh,

convergence of policies, namely the desire that, you know, there

may be, uh, this is early 80s.

So it's the wonderful world of, uh, repeated games.

So, you know, we in, in this game, uh, not

once, but, you know, as a party forever.

Uh, so there there are equilibria where we are both

better off, uh, if we don't get wildly gyrating policies

between these bliss points.

But, you know, they are somewhere in in the middle.

But, uh, as usual, that will give you some convergence,

but not fully converge.

That's what his thesis papers.

Uh.

Anyway, so, so so that's another way to break the

convergence results.

And the positive implications is that, you know, observed policy

reflects now candidate or party preferences.

Uh, this happens both without the, uh, the commitment and

with, uh, probabilistic voting, um, being, you know, the probabilistic

voting model.

The policy also reflects things like the competitiveness election, the

degree of electron uncertainty and such.

But then.

The next question once you have this.

Is that all of this what you said, it assumed

that the identity of the of the parties is given.

So it's there is there is this convergence tendency.

Wouldn't we expect that in the grand scheme of things

that when candidate preferences are made endogenous.

That we get the convergence on who participates in the

election.

Because when entering the elections that you should take into

account the probability.

Well, if the probability is the winning is closer to

the centre, then maybe I will put it in the

centre.

As you saw then in the first lecture you already

talked about, that doesn't necessarily happen.

At least it doesn't happen.

The best model of citizen candidates, where all two candidate

equilibria have a distance between.

The candidate and reason there is a distance.

Is that a costly.

Term, so.

Discreet gained to want to enter?

To get the discreet gain, you must be making a

difference together.

So, uh, that's that um, I think that's, uh, and

the, the formal formalism of, uh, I wanted to say.

So let's lean back a little bit and think about

what we, what we learned or, you know, do the

Cuban Missile Crisis, the, uh, exercise of thinking which streetlights

to these different ways of thinking about the political.

Process.

This model, uh, highlight.

Its different model teach us different lessons.

Beginning with the first one.

The bouncing media motor model.

Has.

Its extensions in various directions.

Says really?

That power derives either from sheer size.

That's your group that is one half, for example.

But also if you have some having a central position

in the policy preference distribution.

So that's like the the model maybe.

So if you happen to be of a of a

of a middle class group this size, then you can

count on being a better represented.

Uh.

Probabilistic voting model and its extensions, uh, would say that

groups that help opportunistic candidates to win, uh, are going

to.

Do.

Better.

Uh, which groups help opportunistic candidates to win?

Those that have many, so many swing voters and cities

high like that or those that have organised interests, uh,

they can all.

Have.

These opportunistic.

Candidates to lead.

And then in terms of, uh, of specific parameters, this

was the, you know, the fine J's and the Alpha

J's, at least in the one dimensional exam.

I think.

That that's those are examples and parametric examples.

And, you know, there are also clear empirical regularities about,

uh, other aspects of the voting process, if you're willing

to take it as given.

And to think about this as empirically.

And one such thing is the turnout rate.

Or in a satisfactory and fully theoretically founded argument, you

know, we have to derive and there are doing.

But suppose we take it as, as from the index,

it's well known, you know, the old core of the

young, uh, the middle class, up to a point more

uh, often than the poor, the well-educated, or more often

than that, that's educated, uh, the, you know, the United

Citizens, uh, vote for the immigrants.

So if we took those differences in turnout rates as

Asked given.

And suppose that the.

Let's suppose that the candidates like what is about an

election.

Also take the.

Landscape.

So that that would be an additional parameter.

Another parameter here I'm calling it faith.

I say.

It's.

Sort of the very simple argument that, uh, you know,

in order to be impressed by a policy promise, I

need to hear the problem.

So in a simple model, everyone knows everything about.

Uh.

You know.

About.

What there is to to know and in particular about

what the candidates are stand for.

But then that's not what you get from political surveys.

Uh, and, you know, if a group is more informed

about policy, then it's more likely to hear the policy

promise that.

And again there are.

Established differences across the educated, uneducated and those who have,

you know, the language as a mother tongue and those

that do not, etc..

So suppose we take those same shares of voters in

each group J regardless if it's given.

And let's take those as parametric.

Uh, now if we do that, we can write down

probabilistic voting model with kind of the same, uh, steps

as we did in, in infections and see of the,

of the slides.

It's just that we when we think about a likelihood

of winning, we make condition.

Uh, a vote on hearing the policy promise.

And we condition a vote About someone turning out on

the margin.

Probably if we appeal to that.

So then the what comes out is a way to

that way.

It's social welfare function where it's not the size of

the group and the, uh, uh, the number of swing

voters in the group that matters, but also the share

of people that hear the policy and the share of

people that would turn out to vote and that would

give auxiliary predictions, uh, about who helps opportunistic candidates to

win and therefore who will be more or less about

the.

Policy making process.

So now I'm not emphasising the particular model you saw,

but the way of thinking that, uh, the modelling kind

of induced.

That certain thing that the, um, that the, the model,

And we tell you that probabilistic voting model is that

groups that have large stakes in policy.

Uh, will be better treated.

So in the medium term model, it's just the sheer

numbers, whether you're on the side of the majority or

whether you're not.

But if politicians really think about when for different groups,

then groups that have a higher stake in the sense

that a small change in policy would mean a lot.

They will get more because the you know, once you

change policy, you're not only changing your probability to winning

is changing.

The utility of this is voters.

And the higher the marginal utility, uh, the more then

you happy.

And, you know, we obfuscate at that point by making,

uh, to some degree, by making, you know, the utility

function symmetric across groups and furthermore linear in in consumption.

But suppose they were nonlinear in consumption than for both

the larger stakes in setting the same.

Transfer.

And reach voters, because simply she had the knowledge and

margin ability, and that would be, you know, come out

in a, in a probabilistic voting model with less stylised

assumptions.

Okay.

Now the point is and model and, and its, uh,

extensions say that groups that will benefit or those that

have preference overlap with kind of popular politicians who, uh,

workers, candidates.

You know, this was this was in the citizen candidate,

uh, parable where We think about, you know, candidates representing

a single segment of the electorate.

More plausible will be to think about if there are

parties that are politician and those parties have a membership

and maybe a leadership that entails preferences of different groups.

But then if the share of of those groups that.

So suppose that, you know, in the party leadership, Jay

is represented by a share Jay.

And similarly for other Jay's.

So you know the leaderships have.

If.

Differential representation maybe it over represents the city of the

countryside.

Maybe Dover represents the well-educated as opposed to the non

educated gens on the nature of the body.

But to just imagine that there is a leadership that

takes policy decisions, that leadership has shares of members or

leaders from different groups in society.

Then you would write the objective function as p, the

probability that the body wins.

Perhaps on this form that we just write here times

the, you know, uh, the surplus that the leadership gets

from setting policy to run in GP, and that will

now be a weighted average of the impact on different

groups who are sort of acting on behalf of their

groups in, in that body.

Lecture 3:

It was a lady who had magic fingers last time.

I think this is new for this year, so I

don't know how to work it.

Yeah, and I have one next to.

The last.

Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

Sorry for I'm travelling.

So that's why I had to do this.

Same thing in next week.

So yeah.

Same thing.

Yeah I can't attend.

But what happens in the last hour it development courses.

So yeah I would like to.

Yeah you will see I'll also have to leave it.

Not much earlier, but.

You're wondering if it's on, but, uh.

Yeah, it seems like, you know.

Yeah, I.

Hate.

To put it on, you know, underneath the middle.

Right.

It's.

Okay.

So how did you find this on the Moodle page?

Yeah they are there.

Yeah they are very good.

Excellent.

Okay, so, uh, I am after.

So here is someone.

There's a couple of difficulties.

I apologise for the scheduling.

The lecture has to be in Berlin on Thursday and

next week.

I have to be in Chicago on Thursday.

So same scheduling, same place at the same time.

While this was the least colliding, uh, rescheduling to find.

Yeah.

Okay.

So, um.

So what's on the plate today?

So the, the title of this lecture is agenda setting

and legislative bargaining, and, uh, We, um.

Uh.

So.

Uh, two things to do.

One is to sort of, uh.

Uh, do the legislative bargaining.

So that's another workhorse model that people use in political

economics.

Uh, which is, you know, not about elections.

More like there is a bunch of elected politicians, uh,

who have to, uh, make some decisions on policy.

And they do it after the election.

And now we study the bargaining problems between.

Uh, and and again, I'll keep the two examples that

we introduced last week and, uh, sort of see how

they look like basically the policies we get out when

we filter them through a couple of measures and.

Then we'll, uh, look at another topic, which is political

agency, uh, meaning a conflict of interest between, uh, the

uh, elected politicians and the voters at large.

And the questions will be main questions.

How serious is it?

And voters discipline, uh, politicians, and can they select politicians?

And what does it do to the, uh, likelihood that,

you know, resources are deprived from that?

This is not perhaps a major problem in Texas or

even the UK, but it is a major problem in

any election democracy.

Uh, so I will also Use this example to sort

of illustrate three different aspects of elections or three different

functions of elections.

You like like a choice between policy alternatives, like a

way to keep.

Politicians accountable and a way to select the more able

politicians for the task at hand.

So I would probably be an exposition in another direction.

So here are the four things to do.

Let me begin with, uh, agenda setting.

So by way of intellectual history, this is kind of,

uh uh uh, there are two forces behind this agenda

setting.

One is that, you know, people who are after arrow

and the.

cycling stuff that we discussed last time, and they were

looking for other ways of looking at the political processes

that kind of create predictions about what you should expect.

And, uh, the other is that, you know, in terms

of, uh, of realities and this idea about two parties

that compete with each other, more than two parties that

compete with each other in an open election, and they

make promises to the voters that's, you know, one way

of politics happens, and it's an important way, obviously.

But there are also powerful politicians who are involved with

so-called agenda setting power.

And you can make proposals.

Uh, and then those proposals are the starting point for

this discussion.

It turns out, uh, if you have a jet setting

and of course, you know, you know, less subject to

cycling because there is an order in which politicians are

able to make proposals.

And so that's less of a problem.

And secondly, um, yeah, then you capture some more realism.

And there are two, two main steps in the development

of this way of thinking about politics.

One is due to political scientists Tom Romer and, uh,

Howard Rosenbaum.

Uh, they are still alive and kicking.

Um, um, so they, um, introduced, uh, the first analysis

of agenda setting, which was applied to one dimension of

politics.

And the, uh, they have a couple of theoretical papers,

one in QG, one in public choice 7879.

And then they apply this also indirectly to uh, uh,

referenda, uh, on uh, school spending in Oregon.

This is one of the first micro micro papers.

So that's why, I mean, uh, so that by being

one dimension sort of falls in the size of government

category, then we'll look at that.

Then the second step in the development is a very

important paper by the environment.

And John John to uh, uh, our political scientist as

well.

Uh, nowadays, uh, Ernest retired, but he's still around.

Uh, Stanford a long time, sir John has moved from

Stanford to NYU.

Uh, but they're among the most, uh, skilled, uh, quantitatively

oriented applied theorists in political science.

And they suggested, uh, an application of legislative legislative bargaining

to, you know, this taking the cake program.

So you know how this, uh, giving cake, uh, given

that, uh, many dimensions in that and they introduced, uh,

a model of legislative bargaining, which you can think about

as an extension of the Rubinstein, uh, bargaining model, uh,

with two people to, uh, multiple, uh, multiple actors.

We look at that two when applying to the composition

of government.

All right.

So to make things simple, I'm going to do that.

This not in full generality, but I'm going to simplify

in a number of dimensions.

And one dimension is I'll just consider three value sectors.

They will be policy motivated but three is more than

two one.

So you know it's a non-trivial problem statement.

We learn the basic ideas from the three person problem.

So think about this.

Uh, as three groups of uh, uh, policy motivated legislators

or parties, we call them J uh, for each type.

And they are perfect delegates of some groups in society.

And therefore each group of legislators would maximise the policy

preferences, uh, of that group, J, which is a region

perhaps in uh, or some other type of group.

And G here again can be either.

Uh, in, in the one dimensional world or it's a,

it's a vector in the ocean.

So I'll try to see how far we get, which

is not very far, but some way, uh, without applying

it to one of the particular problems.

And then we go to the size of government, in

which case we'll think about three legislators representing the poor,

the middle class and the rich, and then we'll go

to the composition of government.

And then we think about them as three regions one.

And that's a simplification.

Uh, that I'll make is a considered, super simple, uh,

agenda setting game.

Uh, not much of a bargaining game, but, um, it

still conveys many of the insights.

So in the jargon of the literature, I consider a

game with closed rules and with one round, uh, closed

rule means that, you know, once the proposal is on

the table, it cannot be amended.

It's just there.

And that's what you call it, an open rule in

the same jargon.

Then a proposal can be made, but that proposal can

be amended one way, one way or another.

And that jargon is is due to violence we introduced.

Sometimes, you know, this kind of bargaining can go on

for, uh, a number of rounds.

So you make a first proposal.

If that doesn't pass, you go on to the second

round.

If that doesn't pass, go to the playground and you

can go for a number of rounds.

So that would be maybe around bargaining.

But here I'm just looking at one single round of

bargaining.

Namely there is an agenda sector.

So you pick an agenda sector out of the district

that legislators and that, uh, agenda centre make a target

on the proposal.

Uh, and that's subject to a single majority vote in

the legislature.

So the timing is this nature excess.

In reality, you may think there was an election in

the past.

There was some distribution in maybe this is a congressional

committee or, or or maybe this is the negotiations about

who is going to form the government to do.

Uh, so then maybe this is the largest group of

legislators, uh, I've got the prerogative of promotion.

Whatever the reason the sector makes a proposal is either

a scalar or a or a vector.

And the on the application.

And then the legislature place your votes.

So if at least one of the other groups of

legislators, J uh, is in favour, then the proposal becomes,

uh, the outcome because it has collected a majority two

thirds status.

Um, if they are equally large, these three groups or

very large, um, and if you don't pass the proposal,

it's only one round.

We must specify what happens.

And then there's going to be a status quo outcome

that is implemented.

Uh, What is the status quo?

Um, depends on the application.

What is the most plausible, plausible interpretation?

Um, one is to think about the types of things

you're, you're, you're trying to design.

So suppose that this was decisions on an infrastructure program

where, you know, the the idea is you build you're

going to build some bridges.

The question is where you build those bridges.

In, in in region one, 2 or 3 for benefiting

this proportion and the people who live there.

If you cannot agree on an infrastructure program to build

bridges, uh, then, you know, you don't build any bridges.

So then the status quo is not truly zero, because

that's the political dream.

If instead this word transfer program, at least it is

an existing program.

Perhaps this proposal that the agenda setter is about reforming.

You know, you are, uh, making a reform of the

medical, uh, system of, uh, remuneration for going to public

health care.

Now, if you have a degree from that, and the

natural alternative is maybe you go home as you did

before and you have the old system in place because

it's already existing.

So that's a different type of program.

And we will see that the status quo is an

important determinant about what happened.

So therefore you know how a legislative bargaining, uh, problem

and depends on the type of program.

The answer, uh, is, you know, the constitutional rules for,

for making or at least the rules for making a

policy.

So, as you know, for the for the US budget,

if, um, the Senate and the House cannot agree to

it after, you know, a certain number of days when

you close down the government and stop government, uh, uh,

down the payments, at least for a while, that's like

before this.

No, no sense, because, you know, the government isn't open.

And then there are various, uh, various rules in various

countries, like in France.

You have, uh, you have the, uh, the cabinet proposes

the budget.

But then there is the famous rule 49.3 that permits

the French cabinet to say, we're not going to have

a vote on this.

I'm just going to pass this budget.

But the other side of the coin is that you

can throw me out.

So within 24 hours, uh, opposition, uh, can call for,

uh, a motion of non-confidence of the government.

And if the government falls, then, you know, it's motion

strikes.

So that's a pretty drastic, uh, thing two and one.

I would have to specify the payoff after the dissolution

of government.

So I used opposition work to say no.

So one can feel this status quo with contents depending

on the particular situation.

One is fine.

So obviously this is going to, um, To lead the

agenda setter to having to do something relatively nice to

at least one other group of legislators.

And in particular, since that, uh, both the other groups

of, of legislative kind of say no to ensure that

the status quo outcome, what they get on that is,

well, then you have to offer at least one of

them, uh, a proposed policy that makes them better off

the status quo.

Uh, whether you want to have equality or inequality or

weak inequality here, that's kind of how you sort of

resolve the tie here.

Someone votes.

Yes, because they are indifferent between the proposals that, uh,

if you don't like district to modify, I say this

is it.

That's.

So this is like a participation constraint.

Uh, you know, you have to have someone else participating

in the majority that passes this legislation.

And what the sector will do is to maximise our

own policy preferences so that the policy preferences on behalf

of the group, subject to this participation constraint as well

as the budget constraint.

Now, there are some general properties that we will always

encounter, whether we look at one dimensional or or multi

dimensional case.

Uh, and this is that the sector is going to

put together a minimum winning coalition.

Uh, that is she would seek support only from one

of the other legislature legislature groups.

At least if she generates conflict of interest across.

And the reason this is something that already rancour discussed

in the classic work that I mentioned.

Early days political science minimum winning coalitions under conflict of

interest is very robust protection.

Then when you seek support from that other legislature, let's

call that person Mrs. X, or in that group, uh,

the group X, uh, you're going to hold the axis

to the status quo, pay off because of this, uh,

participation constraint and my tiebreaking assumption.

I'm just going to give them the status quo.

Pay off no more, because it's going to be costly

for me, as always.

Okay.

Uh.

Then the the third principle that will always happen is

about whom you pick as the, the partner legislature.

And again, the logic that you're maximising subject to this

constraint, uh, makes you pick the cheapest, uh, one on

board, the one that for whom is easiest in terms

of resources you give up to satisfy this constraint.

And that will turn out to be, uh, either someone

with a small group size or someone who has a

low salvageable payoff.

Size.

But this is all generality.

So let's let's instead look at these concrete examples.

So let's first go to the size of government picks.

So now we have three possibilities.

Either the middle uh class, then the group representing the

middle class will set the agenda, make a proposal or

one of the either the poor or the rich.

Uh, representatives.

Uh, the one with, uh, with the middle class group.

Since the agenda is kind of boring.

And the reason it's boring is because, you know, as

you remember, preferences here are monotonic.

So, uh, uh, there is a clear winner in the

legislature, namely the policy that is preferred by the middle

group.

So it can propose that policy and, uh, you know,

against the status quo that will always win either the

support of the of the rich or the or the

poor.

So this is not very illuminating.

Let's instead go to the to the aid when, let's

say the poor are setting the agenda, you can work

out the case with which set the agenda for yourself.

It's sort of analogous exercise.

And then the equilibrium outcome GP becomes this complicated expression.

You can stare at that algebra for a while and

I'm sure you can figure it out.

But I think this is one of these, these instances

where, uh, little picture says more than, uh, a lot

of complicated algebraic expressions.

So let me draw, um, an illustrative diagram here.

So on the, on the y axis, let me put

the equilibrium outcome.

And on the.

Uh, horizontal axis.

Let me put the status status quo point.

And let me also mark here, uh, bliss points of

the rich of the middle class.

And in the middle, for at least qualitatively, it will

have this.

Remember that this is the government model with an income

tax where the poor has the lowest tax price.

Uh, everyone has the same benefits from, from public goods.

So the poor wants more because they pay less on

the margin.

But the middle class would be best, right?

Let me also draw here.

I have this exposition.

Let me draw the 45 degree line.

All right.

Now suppose that the.

Now suppose that, um, the, the status quo is very

high somewhere to the, to the right, uh, or a

higher number than what the poor, uh, would like to.

Ideally, if they could decide unilaterally, then clearly, uh, this

point is better to, to the, to the median guy

who is the one with the closest preferences to the

poor, uh, and, uh, she will even though she hates

this policy.

She hates the just a large status quo, even more

so.

Uh, therefore, the, the, um, the agenda setting for can

propose that, uh, uh, our favourite policy and get it

passed as long as the status quo is to the

right.

So, in other words, if the status quo, the right

of of this point, then, you know, she just proposes

that one day equilibrium will be.

Achieved.

Now, when, uh, suppose instead that this status quo point

would fall into this region.

Now suddenly the middle class, uh, legislator which whose support

the agenda is seeking has some power.

She can say no.

Uh, if.

The sector would continue proposing her ideal point, then it

would be better to both no one and use the

status quo.

So what agenda setter will optimally do we suggest follow

the status quo down?

Along this 45 degree line and always propose the status

quo as long as we reach this point.

Now the the the median legislator is happy.

Uh, but then if the status quo is smaller, if

we approach the infrastructure spending case and it's tempting to

continue drawing like this, but that would be a mistake,

because suppose the status quo is here.

Now I'm a strategic setter.

See, this guy thinks now relative to her ideal point.

This is to too small a level a spending, But

I can pick a point.

Each equidistant in utility space to the status quo that

makes her indifferent.

And the smaller the status quo is, the closer to

my ideal point I can go.

Because, you know, we will keep the distance utility, distance

constant.

So once at this point, we start creeping up again,

and at some point, the status quo is small enough

that Satter can insist on her ideal point again.

And that's what this, uh, complicated formula, uh, tries to

say with the tilde n is that equivalence point on,

uh, in between in this region by the status quo.

Okay.

So, uh, we have already sort of constructing that equilibrium

diagram.

We have sort of made this intuition.

So just to repeat the, um, poor agenda setter, seek

support only from the closest legislator who has most similar

preferences to herself because it's costly.

I refer back to the properties, um, in this slide.

She never sets, uh, proposes a policy about her own

ideal point, obviously, and need not go below the ideal

point of the middle class.

This is because she's maximising and she goes to the

status quo or the equivalent point, depending on the model.

Okay, the class once.

So that's, uh.

And you can do the thing for the Rich group.

Setting the agenda for new.

Construction.

So what are the lessons in terms of, uh, general

insights?

Well, representative of the centre of the centre group.

The one we have called em here, uh, are politically

powerful in the sense that they are a member of

every winning coalition.

Uh, because as long as one of the the other

legislators.

And also, the Centre's power is related to the level

of the status quo.

So the value of agenda setting differs from infrastructures, programs

and transfer programs.

Supposing that the transfer program is somehow a political compromise,

you end up somewhere close to the middle.

But if you know, if it's, uh, you don't agree,

you don't build bridges and water.

Okay, so that's the one dimensional case.

Now let's go to the composition of government example.

For example, three different regions, uh, each having a set

of legislators within a centralised legislature.

They may begin by state.

So remember this is selecting the cake.

We are selecting a tax ahead tax.

And we're using the proceeds of that tax to allocate,

you know to split the cake uh slice of the

cake.

And then we split it into pieces.

Now that vector that describes the solution will obey these

three equations.

First of all, the guy or the legislator that is

outside of the, uh, of the minimum winning coalition.

We get that if something and that vote is not

needed in order to pass the legislation, then there are

two equations that, uh, pinned down, uh, the other two

components of the vector, how much uh, vector gets in

equilibrium and how much the, the, the partner we get

in equilibrium, the one who is, you know, appealing to,

to put together the minimal winning coalition.

This second one, that's the participation constraint.

Right.

So this is the outcome for um, the.

Well, uh, partner X here, uh, under the status quo,

which is the the amount of targeted spending she gets

in the status quo minus the head tax.

And the head tax is just, you know, whatever is

needed to finance that.

That is cool.

So what she gets in this allocation we're studying should

be equal to that or just above.

So that's this equation.

And this then describes the equilibrium implicitly outcome for the

for the sector uh.

Which is this expression.

And so let's try and understand what's going on here.

Um.

So one important point is that, um, uh, the sector.

How much does she get for herself?

Well, this number here is larger than Alsace as far

as is her budget share.

So, you know, if she could decide without any, uh,

having to think about the majority, she would just put

the marginal utility of her own targeted spending equal to

the share that she pays, which is otherwise.

Then our finance is multiplied by this number, which, since

it has a minus sign in the denominator, is a

number larger than one.

In other words, uh, the sector will stop below that

sort of myopically maximising policy.

She will, uh, spend less on those.

And that's pretty easy to understand because, you know, she's

not alone in making the decision.

She also has to keep her partner happy.

So suppose the Agenda centre contemplates spending a little bit

more on her own group.

Then she must raise taxes by Alpheus.

But then the other partner here will be worse off.

And she needs compensation because she requires at least to

be held at her participation constraint.

And now we're increasing the spending.

So we have to check out spending for her as

well.

Given that she's paying for this in terms of taxes.

So how much do I have to compensate her?

Well Differentiating this participation constraint.

Uh, I should, uh uh, I get this expression.

So for every unit I increase spending on myself, I

should be increase spending on my partner with this number,

which was just from the total differential of that, uh,

expression.

Now, that's going to impose an extra cost on the

attacker.

How large is extra cost?

Well, this is the amount that you have to compensate.

This is the size of the, uh, of the group

that you're compensating.

This is the total amount that you're.

Like you're paying.

So the total cost for a hike of your own

spending is the direct cost via taxes plus this compensation.

And once you figure out, uh, why simplify this expression,

you end up, uh, The expression we had the previous

day.

So it's more costly for you than to spend on

yourself and the direct budget cost, because you need to

keep participation.

In your plans.

So that's one insight.

The remaining question is that there are three coalition partners.

And in this one dimensional example, it's easy to see

who is the most attractive coalition partner.

Who is the more attractive coalition partner here?

But we'll have to go to a numerical example to

pin it down completely.

But the principle is something like this.

Uh, you know, given the participation of.

This equation, I can compute.

The cost for spending this amount, uh, myself, in terms

of how much I have to compensate one of the

other two, and I can do that for both of

them.

And that would be a function of the status quo

outcome for that group and the size of that group.

And in fact, this z function will be increasing in

all the three arguments.

Okay.

Uh, the more I spend on myself, the more I

have to spend on, uh, on my project, the better

off my partner is in equilibrium, the more I have

to spend on it.

And, you know, the larger the size of my perspective

on, the more I am.

So it's increasing all these arguments, and I'm going to

pick the coalition partner whose vote is the cheapest to

get.

In other words, I'm going to give them that.

it's increasing, I'm going to select my partner such that

either her status quo outcome is low or her size

is small.

So that's the sort of the qualitative, uh, lessons, the

quantitative ones depends on parametric forms and all of that.

Now, there are some more general lessons, though, that this

super simple model and I think just looking at the

single proposal.

No, no bargaining after that majority participation.

The first one is pretty obvious.

Groups of powerful lawmakers, uh.

Or those that have representatives that often make policy proposals.

So exactly what that means depends on me.

I have, Minister, on your hand.

That minister is often setting the agenda.

The classical example to appeal to here would be congressional

committees in the in the United States, which are very

important, uh, policymaking bodies.

Uh, and, uh, you know, the, uh, by convention, by

perhaps as an equilibrium outcome, uh, the, the, the chairs

of such committees have a lot of say, and the

chairs tend to be the most senior, uh, people in

the majority party, either in the Senate or in the

House.

So the districts send those legislators to Congress, they can

count on getting more benefits than analogous.

The other thing is that small groups, or rather overrepresented

groups, those with the low alpha J in the model,

uh, are doing better in the sense that their representatives

are often part of a coalition, even though they don't

set the agenda.

And here, again, if we continue speaking about the US

Congress, sorry for the lack of imagination.

You know, the classical example would be the US Senate.

I mean, in in the House districts are about the

same size, but in the Senate, you know, it's very

different.

So the smallest state in the Union is Wyoming, which

last I looked at looked at just below 600,000 people.

And they have two senators.

One senator for 300,000.

Uh, the biggest state in the union is California, which

is just below 40 million.

So 20 million, uh, for a Senate seat.

So that's a factor of 60, uh, in terms of

the population base for the senator.

And this is a program that is sort of transferring

money to people.

It's much cheaper to, to, uh, uh, you know, get

acquire the vote of the Wyoming senator.

If the Wyoming senator acting on behalf of the population.

And, you know, there there are empirical papers that looks

at that and a couple of paper by Briony, um,

that looks at the the resource allocation in the US

Congress, uh, in the light of the legislative bargaining model

and defines.

not so fantastically lopsided, uh uh, benefits of qualitative suddenly

goes in that direction.

Now, the classical classic example, uh, would be the Japanese,

uh, uh, legislature, um, which, you know, districts were, were,

uh, designed in the immediate afterward period, the post-war period.

And they are the same geographic districts today, only that

massive urbanisation is taking place.

So people are planning the countryside, going to to Tokyo

and elsewhere, meaning that, uh, you know, the countryside districts

are very, very much overrepresented because of fewer people, uh,

populating them now in the original.

Yes.

There's a lot of rice support to, uh, rice subsidies

to in Japan.

It's often ascribed overrepresentation of the rural districts.

So you can go on thinking about this, and it's

a plausible inroads.

Thinking about targeted special now.

One theoretical, uh, thing is that, you know, if you,

you know, your Rubenstein or sort of that, uh, unanimity

bargaining where bargaining between two people, you know, the, the,

the saying that, you know, the better your outside option,

the the more you get out of the, uh, the,

the bargaining thing that can be given the foundations I

need.

So the ongoing bargaining game.

Now, this is this looks somehow, uh, contrary to the

other insight that I try to convey, that weak groups

here, those that have a low status for the high

school, uh, tend to do better because they become members

of the majority coalition world.

So what's the rub here?

I think it's, uh, depends on, you know, conditional or

unconditional, uh, things.

So, uh, it's still going to be the case that

conditional being part of the majority coalition, you're better off

if your status quo point is higher.

But, you know, being part of the coalition is also

part of the equilibrium.

And those with, uh, bad outside options, they are cheaper

to get on board and therefore they're more of the

coalition.

So it shows that there's a big difference between unanimity

bargaining to equal bargaining and majority of wind conditions.

Also not.

So, uh, a few very direct expansions, uh, of this

one is open rule bargaining.

As I said, proposals can be amended by another legislature.

This is easy to see that this will dilute the

power of that of the agenda centre.

In fact, uh, that are already considered.

This is 1989 American Political Science Review one of the

most cited.

The other thing is multi round bargaining.

Uh, I.

Within a given period there are a number of rounds

1234568.

In fact, in batting average on the there is an

infinite number of rounds.

You buy again uh, until you can bargain anymore.

On the other hand, the size of the pie is

shrinking if you keep bargaining for a long time.

Uh, so in that setting, then, if you're the sector

at a particular round, uh, then unless there is incomplete

information, uh, if you're in the first sector, you, uh,

you still decide the game.

But what you have to take into account is not

the status quo.

All of the other players of the game, but their

continuation, i.e. we can solve that the model backwards kind

of starting at the very high end.

And you know, we can find how much it's worth

to each player to continue playing the game.

And if you compensate for that in the status quo

and get some kind of.

So that generally also dilutes their genocidal power relative to

the simple example.

Yeah.

The third expansion is to go to multi period bargaining.

So you don't you know within each period you may

have more or less bargaining rounds.

But then you also have many periods uh, and in

particular this is interesting when you have a dynamic status

quo.

So perhaps you know the default outcome in period T

is the outcome that you obtained in the previous paper.

There's a paper by the Baron, not the first time.

This is a maybe American Journal of Political Science, uh,

end of the 90s, where he looks at, uh, at

a game that has has a kind of a long

run medium voltage solution, and it shows how you converge

to that long run medium voltage solution, because that's what

eventually you get to.

But it takes a number of periods to get there.

And the reason it takes a number of periods of

getting there is that each agenda setter, if they're not

the medium to start with, they are trying to exploit

the temporary power to set the agenda because they realise

that the the outcome in the next period will determine

how well they are faring.

So it would be a jagged road down to the

outcome where each sector who happened gets a chance to

set the agenda, exploit the temporary power and thinking about

how they would have the game.

It's a pretty complicated thing to solve, but imagine so.

It's also a set of papers by John Sarpong.

Uh, has a degree from the from the embassy.

And he took this course uh, and years ago and,

uh, he got the interested in this stuff, and he

wrote, uh, a couple of papers in the thesis on.

Okay.

And their versions is that, uh, let's say.

And there are other extension.

Of course this is legislative bargaining and as such.

And you know what happens if we study, uh, a

situation where people first elect a legislature, knowing that that

legislature will determine policy by legislative bargaining.

So this is discussed in in that combination of elections

and legislative bargaining is discussed in chapter seven of my

book.

And we give a few simple examples of this referring

to the existing literature, simplifying the existing literature.

And essentially what people will then have an incentive to

do is to strategically delegate by electing, uh, a hard

nosed bargainer, uh, to bargain on their behalf if it

is so selecting the people for example.

So, uh, that's under the assumption that those who were

represented is understand that having a hard nosed bargain can

keep them underground, waiting to make that assumption.

That's what you get.

You can also think about combining legislative bargaining with lobbying.

We did lobbying and elections.

There are some papers on this in the literature.

And Feldman is someone who graduated from Harvard in the

in the around 2000 and something, uh, he wrote.

So, uh, that's one paper I have a paper with

that combines that as well.

You get to look at those.

You.

So I don't think it's an exaggeration to call this

legislative bargaining one of the workhorse models of political economics.

1st May wonder why that is.

I think that one reason is that it's just a,

uh, a well-defined framework for quantitatively oriented economists the political

scientist would like, because it's a well-defined game.

This is one of the things that happened.

It happened in this order.

Uh, and, you know, you can solve it and do

it.

Uh, let's do otherwise.

So this certain, uh, certain aesthetic aspect to it.

Another is that it is an easy way to handle

multi dimensional policy problems.

We did the multi dimensional thing here and the you

know no harder or not much harder than I mentioned.

things, but I think the most important, uh, reason is

that it's somehow easily adapted to model alternative legislative legislative

arrangements.

I mentioned the US budget rules.

I mentioned this tranche 49 three.

Uh, and a good, good example where, you know, democratic

societies differ is in the rules for government formation.

So who gets a call to start the process of

negotiating?

You know, uh, is it automatically the the largest party

in the preceding election?

It is a multi-party system.

Is it the president if you have a parallel president,

is it the king that happens in some some systems.

And then what is the system for approving the, uh,

a government, you know, do you need a, uh, an

active The majority of people that approve, or do you

just need, uh uh, not the majority to be against.

These are subtle differences, but they make for a different,

uh, strategic incentives for forming a government.

Um, there's a very nice paper, uh, on this empirical

paper in econometric, uh, 2003, maybe, um, by Meyer, Julia

Laszlo and, uh, Antonio Mello that studies, uh, with some

simplifications, you know, the, the procedures for government formation in

15 or such, uh, in European democracies or multi-party systems.

And they make predictions or they try to make predictions

about the.

they know the time it will take to form a

government and how the conditions in government would look like,

whether it would be minimum winning or not.

And it's it's a structural model that is estimated, uh,

on that data, and it's pretty successful.

So.

Yeah.

Interesting.

That's that's a good place to put.

Another place where there are different rules are in the

forms of government.

So I have some work that, uh, is partly discussed

in the, in the book, but it was early days

of the book in that research program.

So we have a linear and a contrasted policy making

in parliamentary and presidential systems, where the crucial difference is

that in a, you know, in the legislature of a

presidential system with a separately elected president, them.

You don't have the confidence required as in a fundamental

democracy.

You need to keep a majority supporting the government all

the time, and that you embed a, um, a legislative

bargaining model in those differential set up and think about

bargaining over different types of things like public goods, targeted

redistribution.

And, you know, whether you have corruption or not.

And you get pretty stark, uh, predictions.

And we find proxies for those policies in the data

and say that, by and large, simply, uh, would fail.

These are papers from the early 2000 which are about

constitutional rules and policy.

Policy.

And so it's.

uh, you know, uh, because it's a well defined game.

The legislative bargaining model appears in many places, and it's

one.

Part of the toolbox.

Okay, let me begin on the political agency before the

break, uh, as well.

So, uh, so, again, to repeat political agency, we refer

to a situation where there is a conflict of interest.

Do you know, uh, voters at large and politicians?

Uh, and to illustrate that, I'll stay in the size

of government example, but then modify it, uh, slightly to

illustrate these three different functions of elections.

So let's begin with the electoral competition.

where elections essentially will become a choice between policies.

And let me first show that, uh, you can get

efficient policies, even though, um, politicians would have the opportunity

to, to steal from the voters and even though they

have an incentive to see.

If electoral competition is stiff enough.

So to do that, let's introduce some endogenous rents in

our size of government model.

So now introduce uh variable lowercase r which is constrained

to be non-negative as a kind of something that is

interesting from the viewpoint of the politicians but uh, harmful

from the viewpoint.

Okay.

Okay.

So it can be a diversion of funds for personal

gains.

Um.

Can be.

Maybe party finance could be other corrupt acts, such as,

uh, you know, wasting government resources, selling hammers for $500

apiece and, uh, letting relatives take the contract or whatever

the case may be.

So, very simply, before we have the per capita, uh,

budget constraint and the income tax, uh, times the average

tax base was equal to per capita spending.

Now that are the diversion of funds per capita so

that we can write the articles for this.

So one thing that this does is that it destroys

the, you know, the no longer is this a one

dimensional policy.

It's a two dimensional policy, at least because it has

a tax rate.

They have the level of spending.

And we have this, which is perhaps not the policy,

but it has a policy consequences.

And so that's the opportunity, the incentive.

I'll do it.

Brute force.

I just say this gives direct utility to to the

politicians.

So their their role in life is now.

So the expected utility of if your candidacy is your

probability of winning the election, uh PC times the ego

rents associated with office exogenous and given us before.

But now these, uh, endogenous rents such a big carve

out as part of designing the the government program.

So I add also this, uh, this gamma parameter to

just in a very cheap way, capture some, uh, some,

uh, institutional features.

It's very reduced form and unsatisfactory, but nevertheless, let me

let me do it anyway.

So, so this is what is, uh, extracted from the

voters.

But gamma times are where gamma is a number less

than one is what the politicians capture.

So in other words, the lower is gamma, the harder

it is to to, uh, extract resources to yourself.

And this supposedly has to do with the existing judicial

and political checks and balances.

Uh, you know, the threat to be from the court.

You have to do a, uh, a long road, uh,

around to get, uh, get the money out.

And, you know, something is lost in the process.

So think about law as as a kind of checks

around.

Yes.

Um, there are there is no intention by the.

Is it been just wasted on of, uh.

Is that.

Again, if, for instance, gamma is lower than one.

So for instance if it's one half.

Yeah.

Then there's one half of ah that is, that goes

to the petition and then one half.

That is true.

No, no there is still still diversion from the from

the voters is still the full amount.

Just that, you know, the there's not the one for

one exchange.

And then the politician gets a little bit less than

the voters lose.

Uh, and she gets even less than the tougher of

the checks and balances in the judicial or, or other.

Okay, then.

Uh.

Uh, for the voters, uh, they they lose the full

amount.

So if we write down the policy preferences of the

voters no longer function G.

It's a function of this vector q, it's y minus

g plus r times the tax base.

Uh, the income tax payers plus the utility of the

spending that goes to productive use.

So there are two two independent dimensions here.

But uh, it turns out we can, we can rely

on on well known reasoning anyway.

And the reason is that the second dimension, uh, the,

uh, the rent is a kind of balance issue.

Uh, maybe there is no conflict of interest among the

volunteers.

They all agree that this is bad.

And if they could choose, uh, unless a benefactor, one

of those relatives, you know, they would choose, um, ah

to be zero, uh, independent of how much they're paying

in taxes.

So they are in fact, you're not unanimously again.

This is something called, as I said, sometimes called the

violence issue, uh, an issue where all the voters agree.

Um, so the conflict of the policy is two dimensional,

but the conflict of interest across borders is still one

dimension.

It's related to the fact that they're paying different taxes.

In fact, this situation is what, uh, a French mathematical

economist, uh, calls intermediate preference.

If you want to check, this is the reference in

chapter two of our text to the journal article.

And it's essentially it's a one dimensional conflict of interest.

And as a result of that, there is still going

to be a Condorcet winner in this setting, even though

there are two dimensional, uh, issues here.

And the winner is that the level of spending preferred

by the median person and rents being equal to zero.

If you start against any other policy, it wins.

So we can study, uh, a benchmark downscale models.

Let's make the same assumptions as last week.

We have many groups.

Uh, they pay the income tax.

We have two rent seeking candidates.

Two candidates are exogenous given and they commit to policy.

So given that we maintain the the the assumption of

commitment.

And again, because of the, uh, the monotonic policy preferences

in this one dimension of, of conflict of interest, uh,

across voters will result in this very discontinuous list and

stark, uh, probability of winning function.

So even though the, the contents of that of the

medians, um, uh, policy preference is a vector, if she

likes that vector that is proposed by candidate A less

than one for candidate B and candidate A has no

chance of winning.

Uh, the opposite situation.

If she likes it better than the proposal by candidate

B, and uh, will have probability of winning if she's

indifferent.

So a unique equilibrium outcome is going to be that

both candidates converge on one, uh, policy.

So it's identical to the policies we got in the

bouncing model with opportunistic politicians.

It's identical to the to the outcome we got in

the Downton model with autism politician.

Now we get it with rent seeking.

Uh.

And the reason is that in all three cases, commitment

gives voters a choice between two policies.

Those two policies, when you design them as a candidate,

you have very strong incentives to win.

Uh, as long as there's an ignorance tied to winning,

uh, you prefer that not winning, and therefore you please

leave it alone.

That's the end of the story.

They say to stick to the logic of.

This particular case.

Yeah, that's the intuition.

Okay.

Okay.

The competition for the exogenous rand is fierce enough to

eliminate the endogenous.

Right.

So the third time we get this result.

But then, uh, when we discussed it last week, I

also said there were two, two ways of killing it

by changing the assumption.

One was to do away with the commitment, the other

idea was to do away with, uh, with, uh, this

continuous pressure, uh, uh, probability of winning function.

And we did that via the probabilistic voting model.

And we can apply the same logic here to get

perhaps more interesting equilibrium with predictions about determinants of, of

corrupt acts such.

So.

Uh.

Take the probabilistic voting setup.

So for example, the one we considered in, in uh.

Uh, week two is what I call section C.

And let's take the simple case where, uh, it is

interesting, uh, voting stocks have the same density in all

groups.

And, uh, let's consider the same timing as before We

can take precisely the same steps as we did in

the last week, so we can define swing voters in

each group.

Just that the probability that the policy preferences look different.

But this is the, uh, you know, the idiosyncratic shock

to the voter.

This is the aggregate voting.

So if you remember the LPA and, uh, we did

the same type of calculations as we did last week,

we get the probability of winning for candidate A is

one half plus psi, which is the density of his

aggregate voting short time times the utility difference between the

two in the two, uh, policy proposals for the average

voter.

That's why there's no J here.

All the groups are kind of similar.

Okay.

So.

Now if candidates were purely opportunistic.

So they maximise the probability of winning times and then

this would give efficiency.

But here politicians by assumptions are not uh interested in

that.

Uh they are interested in PC issues.

There's a bracket missing here I guess.

So it should be on bracket R plus gamma times

lowercase r.

So then there's a trade off between, uh, stealing some

from the voters and, you know, diminishing your popularity and

therefore your probability of winning.

And that's a well-defined trade off because, uh, you can

change this, uh, marginally and continuously.

And when you do that, then your probability of winning

will fall, uh, marginally and continuously.

If you're personally decreasing your, uh, your, the utility of

your proposal.

And as a result, performance continues.

So but since the two candidates here are symmetric, they're

both interested in winning to some degree and interested in

stealing some degree.

Um, but with the same weights on the two, then

they will converge, uh, on the, on a policy that

maximises that object, uh, their objective, given the probability of

winning function.

And in general, there will be, uh, um.

There will be a first order condition for for spending

as such.

Which will be have this same form as before and

it will lead to efficient spending.

This requires the marginal utility of spending zero.

But inefficiencies will show up when it comes to rents.

And there is this trade off between the probability of

winning against marginal rents.

So you will have, uh, the effect of expanding, uh,

uh, rents for one iota on the probability of winning

times your infra marginal rents, times that, you know, the

fact that probability is falling and, uh, Because there is

a non-negativity constraint on R.

Uh, this is a complementary slackness condition.

Uh, so, uh, in an equilibrium, this derivative can never

be positive because then you push harder, uh, until it

becomes zero.

Uh, but it can be negative when you hit the

zero constraint.

Uh, so this is, uh, the condition that has to

be satisfied and is complementary with, uh, you know, this

constraint non-negativity constraint binding or not, if we take into

account that in equilibrium, both, uh, both candidates do the

same thing, that leaves them with, uh, each with one

half probability of winning.

We can introduce that.

And then we can conclude that rents will be the

maximum of zero.

And you know what you get when you solve this

quantity, which is this term.

So in other words, rents will be positive if.

The ego rents for holding office are small.

If gamma is large namely that there are weak checks

and balances and the is uh, CI is small, meaning

that there is a lot of uncertainty so that the

probability of winning is not very sensitive.

Deposits can be.

Higher after case or can get very.

So the intuition is pretty simple, so that these candidates

are not perfect substitutes to the voters.

So that gives them some power and to set policy

in a way that pleases them.

They have some room to pursue their own agenda.

In this case, withdrawing from the voters is somehow analogous

to the case with partisan partisan candidates who have room

to pursue their own agenda relative to the average of

the electorate.

They can pursue a policy that is more to the

left or more to the right, because they only lose

votes, uh, continuously, and therefore they strike a compromise here.

They strike a compromise between stealing some, uh, preserving the

probability at all.

Yeah.

So higher rent positive means that taxes are higher than

they they would have to be, or alternatively, spending is

lower than it would have to be.

But here in this particular example, we choose spending that

way should be at least according to the voters preferences.

We can do some comparative statics now.

I mean, it's a simple model, but if you allow

me a colourful interpretation of the simple model of the

parameters in the simple model, suppose all were smaller, uppercase

R were smaller.

So that's ego rents were lower.

We can perhaps think about this as politicians thinking about

the regimes as more the regime political regime as more

illegitimate.

Interjected.

So it doesn't give such a, you know, high status

to the Prime Minister of a of the banana Republic.

That's to the, uh, Prime Minister.

More.

Uh, the more illegitimate regime you are striving less to,

uh, to get it.

So you compete less for the, uh, office and used

in some more.

What?

We already interpreted as the checks and balances to the

extent that these larger, uh, politician, uh, gets more.

So, you know, rents will be higher if you're less

constrained if the electoral uncertainty is larger.

We already discussed that.

And then if we introduce other features, Uh, in problem

for one in the in the text, uh, you're asked

to to solve the case where, you know, this popularity

shop doesn't have a mean at zero.

It has a mean, uh, to the left or to

the right, uh, of zero, meaning that one of the

parties is more popular.

One of the candidates is more popular than the other.

And what comes out then is that, you know, rents

in equilibrium are lopsided.

The popular candidate has more room to pursue her own

agenda because she's, uh, more popular and therefore has a

very good.

Okay, so now maybe this is a good time for

a great time.

So.

So it's 20 after two, so maybe you it's not

20 to 3 20 minutes.

Yeah.

So.

Yeah.

You mean the one with, uh, uh, the information?

Yes.

Yeah.

So, uh, given my hand.

Right.

Something more important.

What do you think.

About the Nobel Prize?

I don't know.

You said something at the beginning of the lecture.

No I didn't.

What was I supposed to call?

No, no, no.

You're right.

It's just my curiosity.

Yeah, right.

What does it expect?

I don't know.

You never know.

I don't know.

And I have a long background and shouldn't speak too

much about.

I.

I resigned in 2020.

Okay.

There's.

There's some, uh, some, uh, confidentiality around the process, so

I can't comment too much on that.

Yeah.

I think it's a good price, and I know that,

um.

Uh uh.

Sorry, but.

Uh.

Some ways, you know, they the company which was cited

as, uh, uh, one of the major things achievements for

which price was.

Perhaps, you know, this is from 2000.

So it was written in name is X7.

The first idea, and this is pretty early, even from

the viewpoint of, uh, you know, the credibility revolution.

It's, uh.

Yeah.

Um.

Yes.

You know, the calling papers had been written but hadn't

really spread throughout the field.

So, yeah, this notion of a specific, very specific topic

in a way.

But I mean, of course you can.

Important, uh, you can call about it, about that identification.

Some people have qualms about, you know, there's a there's

a lengthy debate in the, in the Rs is, uh,

economists are going to discuss and try to replicate, uh,

claims that you couldn't replicate or, uh, was the second

discussion, right?

I guess he maintained that one could interpret the.

Discussion about that, but that's okay.

I mean, if if you have an important paper with,

with a lot of traction, then the incentives to go

after it.

And that's the thing is, it would be interesting to

know, like the criteria for the kind of.

Yeah, yeah.

You can read the motivation.

Yeah, yeah.

You can read the comments.

You can respond.

Okay.

So.

Gene Robinson, he said these are real economic historians.

He you know, he's an archive guy.

So not only is not an archives guy, but he

has our case working for us.

So it doesn't guarantee that.

No, no.

Yeah, I feel that.

I felt that respect to the audience.

If you look at the wine development or to be

involved with the evolution there, there was maybe a method

that was applied and applicable to many other, uh, topics

in a way.

Yeah, but it's more about a specific topic, which is

almost all the applications in the beginning were to labour

and to, uh, individual level data apply to the country

level data in the 1600s.

That was a kind of a bold.

Thing.

I mean, that principle for identification of the same whatever.

So what's the reaction?

I still don't know and haven't had the chance to

speak with like mine.

But yeah, I saw some comments, maybe on Twitter.

Of course, you know the community.

There were some economists complaining, but they're particularly, uh, controversial,

not controversial, but there's super like, uh, you know, kind

of harsh.

It's like Baldwin, for example.

Yeah, yeah, he's super always, uh, uh, I mean, uh,

he really cuts through the NSA.

I don't think so.

Yeah.

That's, um, but I can console you.

I mean, first, I think, you know, when he was

a PhD student at Rochester in the mid 80s, he

was saying this.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, it doesn't seem like the kind of

guy who, uh, like, changed his character, But yeah, so

it was commenting a little bit saying it was a

bit ideological, uh, I agree.

But uh, the other month.

Um, uh, yeah.

I mean, uh, of course institutions, democracy are important, so.

That's right.

Yeah.

But yeah, it's super harsh, like.

Probably it's black and white.

The next time before the lecture.

Hey, everybody.

Thank you so much for.

Sharing the company about IBM.

Oh, and, uh, general organisation.

I know it's a long stretch, but because one of

the things I wanted to do is make sure it's

kind of like nature and culture.

Reference because I know this is what you call right?

Like, like nowadays where we have we have, you know,

this is this is what we have, uh, this person

is different aspects of, uh, this is the this one

is the best.

So, uh, I have like organisations, the other ones are

at the level of, uh, the economy or so we

have one in the Cites, uh, where.

I think it's the first issue.

Uh, so they are democratic values.

Those are good, but then you have to apply those.

If I'm thinking about complaining.

Yeah it's okay.

Yeah, I know if you want.

I mentioned for companies then I guess it's a bit

harder then you'd have to.

Just do both of them and uh uh, whether they

uh uh, shoot or make some kind of country.

Uh, so, uh.

Uh, I guess the problem is, you know, uh, on

one particular example like this with the IBM makes some

of them.

I think that it was a plausible and I think

it was very sort of mainframe audio, you know, making

pieces and things keep on top of the collection.

But I think, you know, if you read the very

interesting applications have become.

You know, patient country they are.

So I talked to that all about talking about um.

And so, you know, he was here last night to

talk about.

Simon Johnson.

Then he gave.

He gave a talk in Stockholm in the.

Kitchen.

So we talked about it.

So I think he would agree that, you know, there

in the orientation of the work, you know, where you

know what, what is it that you want to achieve

with that?

A is is in his mind is the problem.

You know, and it's about replace.

Uh, and uh, and that's what is.

So so is the, the culture in the, in the

organisations, you know, companies um is oriented.

That easily which.

From place to place at Johnson's, um, bargain.

Uh.

Less for the usefulness of humans and more.

You know, a particular aspect of profitability.

Uh, so that may be something to think about, because

look at that.

Look at their look at their various programs, huh?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Yes.

And what what do you think about that as a

contribution?

We didn't call it.

They don't call it that.

Uh, how do you use your technology?

In a way.

What kind of.

Yeah.

Or what is what is the goal of the innovation?

I mean, the innovator is actually intrinsically right.

So it's, uh.

Uh, and, uh, we know from the work.

I don't see another side.

You know, they just.

Uh.

She was, uh, she graduated from the.

Okay.

That's, you know, she shows that that magical innovation and

made them see maybe that they, you know, they just

work on drugs that are going on for women, black

and white.

You know, they just, uh, work on drugs that are

more or less equal for businesses that are trying harder.

So, you know, there is some intrinsic information and you

can describe that perhaps autistic culture and anything that is

of value.

So the model was, uh, we give them something that

is evolving so that that's the problem with that half

dozen papers.

They all have a complementarity to this.

And coming.

From another choice made by a bunch of people.

Those people are hydrologic types and the distribution of types

of people in the country.

And then basically, the more you have in a certain

time, the more interesting it will be for the organisation

or the government.

Whatever you say to do things that are favourable for

that kind and then it becomes an evolution process.

More the government does of that.

The more interesting it is to be the times that

benefit from that, and then makes it even more interesting

to be a choice.

So the politics in that direction.

So you have this two way feedback process that takes

you into divergent dynamics.

One or the other.

I think you said, obviously I'm home blind, but it's

kind of unusual for a political.

Theorist that I mean, previously in.

Organisational economics, there is the.

Notion that it causes cancer.

But that's exactly as you said.

We've been trying.

Actually, I presented the paper, uh, a couple of years

ago in the in your organisation economics issues.

That might see them.

Anyway.

It's a group whose limited, limited success, I think, because

they're not in this market and they think in a

different way.

But that's.

Yeah, I think that's the reason.

Okay.

Thanks.

Thanks for coming in.

Yeah.

Of course.

One way to think about it.

Like you move from being more like a leader.

Political.

Movement.

That's really, in a way, like kind of mind politics.

I don't think that's a choice.

Uh, yeah, we took that.

How much?

Has that archetypical organisation choice?

Yes.

I would like to.

Find ways to make one per organisation or organisation.

And I don't.

Know how you feel about that.

Yeah.

Thank you.

Yeah that's great.

And the perspective that again is shared with one of

your photographers.

Yes.

Of course we have different interests, such as if they

have a different culture.

It's important.

Communication.

Is so much.

Reinforced.

And it was a little like hiring people or getting

people that are like similar to your culture versus not.

And I think that's because that's the other part, right?

But it's not like you start to make people in

your company more like year or not.

But it seems.

Like the extent would be, you know, the point of

our paper we were actually working with like.

You know, two dimensions, uh.

Additional left to right and then some other, uh, you

know, other problems I mentioned, or social.

Conservatism, social.

Liberalism applied to migration or green issues or.

Whatever.

Uh, and then.

Yes.

Then In whom would you run as a candidate?

Um.

Maybe a way.

You're interested in Brexit, like Boris Johnson?

Oh come on.

They don't sell.

Colleges.

Or universities, potentially.

I don't think.

So.

So it's a similar kind of.

Exchange.

I'm going to take those hostages.

Yes.

Okay, so, um, let's try and, um, do the last

two stations.

Uh.

Um, this one political agency and electoral accountability.

Uh, it sort of takes a stepping stone.

Okay, so after now we assume that, um, that, uh,

you know, politicians can commit and make a policy promise.

I do like to write, uh, a contract with the

voters, and then they stick to a contract.

But what is enforcing that contract?

Obviously, no outside enforcement, but, you know, the reputation of

the politician or some indirect mechanism.

Uh, but in this case with, uh, where where politicians

are rent motivated.

Then again, you know, there are going to be enforcement

problems.

And because if once you have power, you have the

opportunity to use the power and then whatever you promised

ahead of the election, it's always that temptation to break

it so that, you know, there's a tension between the

what's the exposed optimal thing to do and what's, uh,

what you might have promised at some point.

So, um.

Instead of voters behaving prospectively, selecting candidates who have made

promises to them.

Uh, voters may want to evaluate policies exposed.

And, uh, you know, if they see a candidate behaving,

then they punish them by tossing them up.

Right.

So.

Right.

So, uh, so that's called retrospective voting.

Uh, backward looking, voting for voting.

Um, and of course, somehow voters do both things, or

some do perspective and some do retrospective.

It's hard to handle them and, uh, both of them

in the same model.

So now let's shift gears and think about retrospective observations.

So then, uh, politicians will be accountable for their behaviour

and elections becomes an accountability mechanism rather than a way

to pick upon us.

Uh, but then, of course, anticipating that they will be

held accountable, which shapes the incentives of our policymakers so

they will act still in the expectation that voters will

will behave in this way.

And.

shape the sentence, but it's a different set of incentives

attention.

So let's look at that at the sort of generic

or the simplest model of government accountability.

And in fact, the first attempt to doing doing the

writing down such a model that I know at least

was done by Robert Barron.

Uh, Robert Barron, the metric.

So this is a public choice 1973 or such.

Where did, um, a couple of mistakes.

But this was in the these were in the niceties

of the game theory.

And he was kind of excused because, you know, it

was about subgame perfect equilibria.

Nobody really knew about these things except that I myself

had written about them in, in German at the time,

so it's okay.

But the the paper that everyone cites now is by

John John.

So it's the same as Byron and John talked about

before.

Uh, so yes, a uh 19.

79 paper again in Public Choice about, uh, about accountability.

So, um.

Let's look at this in the simplest possible example.

So I'll simplify even more in this size of government

example.

So let all voters have the same utility.

So they have the same, uh, incomes implicitly.

So you know, a had tax or an income tax

doesn't matter.

But uh, they have some, some income.

They get tax and they get utility from the taxes

to spending, but can also be diverted as rents.

Actually Verizon doesn't do it with rents like this.

He does it with government effect.

But if you think about efforts as negative taxes and.

So the timing now in this setup will be the

following.

Focus begins by setting a set of reservation utilities we

call reservation utility Omega I for voter I.

And the reservation utility is a threshold level.

Uh, if the income that gives you utility above that

threshold, you're going to re-elect her.

Otherwise you're going to toss around.

Then the existing incumbent sets the policy.

So that will be, you know, how much to steal

and, uh, how much, uh, public goods to give to

the voters.

And then an election is held in the world.

That's in the Verizon model.

The world doesn't end.

This is repeated, uh, in an infinite number of periods.

Uh, and, you know, it's this counting of the future,

but, uh, much of it can be still conveyed in

a, in a static setting.

So, um, so this incumbent, uh, has an objective, and

that reflects the new time.

She's just there.

So when she's there, she can withdraw something.

So that's.

Ah, but then that's subject to these checks and balances.

So, uh, you only get gamma.

I'm sorry for yourself, but then you, you're interested in

expected, uh, ego rents.

So the probability with which you're re-elected times beta for

beta is a discount factor.

And.

Ah.

Uh, I'm going to take as exogenous in this.

On paper, this is derived as, uh, the expected future

rents, discounting and a stream.

Um, in this election, uh, the incumbent is posed against

an opponent, and the opponent is identical in all respects.

Uh.

Doesn't need to be the case.

And in the model, in the next section, we'll look

at different types of, uh, politicians.

But here the opponent looks the same.

Now, I would be interested in thinking about the best

policy that the authors could potentially carve out for themselves.

So I'm going to make the unrealistic assumption that all

voters coordinate on the same strategy, in the sense that

they keep the same reservation.

Um, so that's going to mean that if the politician

satisfies that reservation and she has a probability of one

of being elected, and if she doesn't, she has a

role in the zero.

So that's bang bang.

If you wanted a more realistic setup, you could have,

uh, distribution of, uh, of reservation levels.

And the question is how they intersect between the sets

of different ways.

But if there were a distribution of reservation levels, then

this pie would be a smooth function of how much

it delivered to the voters.

Um, and, uh, you know, we work basically as the

probabilistic voting model.

That's how the modelling in the next section will look

like.

So do you think this is too simplistic way of

looking at.

How this politician, uh, the, the incumbent, is going to

be subject to an incentive constraint, which is a kind

of a I say in the temporal trade-off, although it's

a sort of one one time choice.

So you have two choices.

So either you replace the voters this way, giving them

their resolution utility, then you know that you get re-elected.

So you get re-elected with probability one and you capture

this perhaps future.

And then you said whatever rents that make you fulfil

that.

And you just mentioned, uh, utility.

So this is what you get if you comply with

the markets or you can choose not to comply.

But then if you choose not to comply, since this

is not ongoing and you don't worry about your reputation,

what's your best strategy?

You sell everything you can.

Right.

So then what you do is you divert the whole

tax base, which is y, and then you get gamma

out of that.

So this is an incentive constraint that needs to be

fulfilled for the for the politician not to take the

money and run, you know, do uh, necessarily allow the

type of policy.

Um.

Okay, so now what is the best policy for the

voters?

For treating them, they are all identical.

We have assumed that, uh, what is what is it

that will give them the maximum utility?

Well, it would be the the policy that maximises their

policy preferences subject to two, which is the government budget

constraint.

And then this incentive constraint.

And the solution to that is that rents are set

at the maximum of zero.

And this number and the level of spending is set

at, uh, the minimum of the socially optimal level.

And this number and the second entry in both of

those comes when the, uh, constraint is binding.

Uh, so, uh.

You know, you can only tax the population that much

and that's why you get.

These.

Possibilities.

So we can study the mechanics of this, but it's

relatively intuitive and not so very different from what we

obtained before, except that you don't get, uh, spending, uh,

at the optimal level, as we did in the, in

the efficient equilibrium.

Now we can also have a smaller number when this

is the constraint this is operating.

So when that happens the incumbent gets away with some

rents unless theta times or is high and gamma and

y are low.

So that is understandable.

or is the same intuition as we had before in

the in the album, down by the same intuition as

the payoff to to stealing and now why being being

low means that the that the threat that the politician

can impose on the voters is smaller because, you know,

the tax base is so small that, you know, she

cannot inflict much harm without her power is not so

much.

So this is the intuition, even though in looking at

backward looking, voting for voting, but of course, the politicians.

How can voters implement this, uh, this optimum where the

incumbent is going to set policy accordingly if voters set

the reservation level the right level, and that will be

the one that is associated with taxes necessary for for

the optimal and the incentive compatible or and utility they

can probably optimise.

So then the voters can exploit this electoral accountability to

somehow, um, get the incumbent to act in, in the

incentives.

But they may have to give up some somewhere in

that process.

Now, another extension that you can make that very jumpstarted,

that and other people have worked on later is to

look at asymmetric information.

And this natural to think that there is asymmetric information

between the voter and the government, For example, if G

is the production of public goods is about the internal

security or external security, then the voters don't know as

much about the about the cost of providing that as

the government, uh, will know.

And if there is such asymmetric information about costs, it's

a little bit more complex to analyse.

But typically what it will mean is that income that

will earn additional rent, she can pretend that that state

is high cost and, uh, when it's in fact low

cost that you can access extra, uh, that way.

So what always works?

I don't do injustice to very interesting literature in this

very second summary, but roughly.

I wanted to get to this.

This last section, which is I think is maybe a

little bit more interesting, which is about, uh, political agency

and, and election selection.

So now we're not going to look at policy as

a means of selecting elections as a means of selecting

a policy.

We are not going to look at it as a

way of rewarding good behaviour.

I mean, the previous model was sort of controlling moral

hazard, if you like.

Um, but rather to select a competent or an able

leader given the problems that are facing the country.

So if you like you the focus is here on

controlling adverse selection.

And the the roots of this is an analytical setting.

It's kind of interesting.

So, um, this what I'm going to show you is

some something we wrote for, for our, for our textbook,

uh, chapter four of of our, of our text.

But, um, sort of the insight we drew on was

a paper by Susanna Lau, merges with a scientist at

UCLA, German scientist, who had discovered that there was a

simpler way of conveying the, uh.

The notions in a in a set of papers by

control.

Okay.

Ken Rogoff, um, has an R paper from 1990 and

e and um and Seibert, who is, uh, just out

of college.

Um, they have a paper from, uh, Economic Studies, 1988.

Uh, and it's about electoral cycles.

And, um, let me tell you a little bit why

they wrote those papers.

It's not immediate.

Why.

It's here.

But anyway, so the idea was that there was a

dominant idea, um, in the, in the, up to the

1980s that there was a kind of voters were behaving

or introspectively they were rewarding good performance, uh, of the

incumbent with more votes.

And there were people like Ray Sayer and others.

Hoo hoo.

So this is known as the political cycle.

You know, the, uh, politicians had incentives to impress voters,

particularly before elections.

And as a result of this, they managed to do

so.

They'll be rewarded the next even before are estimated with

the econometrics of the time.

And that found that an extra GDP point of GDP

growth gave two, two percentage points, uh, extra votes for

the income.

That's US.

Presidential.

Elections.

And this was interpreted as a, you know, as a

as a Phillips curve, if you like.

So of course, uh, then people started thinking in terms,

uh, like, you know, the Lucas critique.

What kind of relation is it?

It's an it's an equilibrium relation.

So we should derive it and we shouldn't take it

for granted.

So.

Rogoff inside but wrote these papers to to say that

what looks like uh, uh, law in terms of backward

looking behaviour may not be a law of backward looking

behaviour at all.

It may be equilibrium, forward looking.

So this was the, uh, what they wanted to show,

and they did it in a setting where voters were

looking at the performance of the current government, uh, the

current incumbent, as a means to learn about her ability.

And, uh, you know, if they learn that they have

a good and able, uh, incumbent of their hands, they

are more likely to to re-elect that income because she's

perhaps better than the prospective alternative, which is the position.

So what you see and may interpret in the data

as a backward looking relation between incumbent behaviour and voting,

may in fact be, uh, uh, manifestation of forward looking

voters that are trying to learn about the, uh, the

ability of incumbents and acting accordingly.

And so this was the object.

But then to some and they did this in a

full blown signalling model where, uh, you know, the, the,

the incumbent and also types the voters don't know the

type.

And they are trying to learn about the.

Census and alone and uh, discovered that one can make

the same points in a setting where the signal jamming

like in in Armstrong's career concerned.

Uh.

Because the the incumbent doesn't know the type, right?

Uh, she will learn it also.

So that's the interaction history.

Now let's let's do it.

So, um, so we will assume that politicians, uh, have

different abilities or ability comes in different types.

Ability affects performance.

And ability lasts over time to some degree.

So these are the fundamental quality.

Now we're going to parameterise that in the specific model.

Right.

So um in order to think about learning and so

on we need some time now.

So we need at least two periods.

So I'm going to use two periods.

And there would be an election in between the two

at the end of period one before periods.

In order to make this as transparent as I can,

I'm going to further simplify the period.

T is the need for voter AI to be just

a linear function.

Income minus taxes plus some linear utility of government spending.

And then I'm going to allow for a, you know,

dislike of income and so on.

Idiosyncratically politician okay.

So why do I take this picture before we have

agency?

Well, if we now we're going to have uncertainty.

Uh, if we have concave functions, we have to worry

about risk aversion inside.

I don't want to do that.

Uh, just want to look at first order of things.

So, uh, now we're imposing a risk.

Neutrality.

This sigma is a test bias against the incumbent, which

is in uniform, um, on asymmetric distribution in the same

way as in the probabilistic voting.

So this is a dummy, uh, that only applies in

period two with the incumbent three election.

We don't have an aggregate popularity shock here like we

have in the probabilistic voting model, but we will have

an ability shock attack and that will play exactly the

same role or an analogous.

So let's introduce.

That.

So the policy you know, how much utility you're able

to deliver to the voters, uh, is given by how

much you tax them, minus how much you steal from

them.

So this is what's left over by the government budget

constraint.

But then there are two more components.

Your ability et, pt adds to the utility you managed

to go to.

Some, uh, politicians are better able to convert resources into

utils or to levels of spending.

They're not like that.

So that's the ability of the politician.

And then Newt is just a productivity shock.

So this productivity shock can confuse the voters because they

are subject to a learning problem.

May be harder to learn about how able a politician

they have at their hands if there are also others

noise.

So I say this is noise.

Specifically, I'm going to assume that this ability for any

new politician is drawn out of a normal distribution.

Normal distribution has mean at the bar as somebody.

But as we will see, it will last over time.

So there will be some scope for that.

The productivity shock is drawn out of another normal.

It has been zero.

And somebody else.

And then to make things life a little bit easier,

we're going to assume that ability and productivity are uncorrelated.

So zero covariance.

Okay.

So what is the incumbent objective.

She has the following.

She is there.

She has been elected to some test period.

And she can steal some from the voters now.

So she gets logarithmic utility out of that.

Um, and then she would there would be electoral uncertainty,

uh, potentially, uh, about whether you re-elected to period two.

If you're re-elected to period two, then you're going to

discount anything you earn in period two, and you'll get

going to get some rents.

And then again, you're going to get some friends in

period two.

So you earned the right to extract some more if

you if you win.

So as you as you see here, I've set gamma

equal to one in terms of our earlier notation.

So forget about that parameters.

It's kind of shallow anyway.

And then I've added some curvature in red here in

order to get.

At least.

One.

So here are the important assumptions about politician ability.

And this is where Susanna Loman, uh, saw the light.

So the incumbent voters don't know ahead of time what,

uh, type of how able a politician is, but neither

does the politician herself.

So if we're brainwashed with signalling models, maybe we think

that this is outrageous.

But if we think about the application here, you know,

you're newly elected, you're supposed to deal with the problems

of the government, maybe have to deal with the unions.

You have to deal with the foreign, foreign, foreign policy,

the, uh, criminal gangs, you know, you know how good

you are because you, before you have tried, may have

a clue, but then you may have the same expectation.

And my the average guess I can make is the

average in the population at the bar.

Anyway, we assume, uh, the incumbent doesn't know her ability,

for example.

If the incumbent would be re-elected, then her ability lasts.

So whatever The, uh, the public, uh, beliefs about viability

in the in period one they will believe in period.

If the incumbent is ousted, then, uh, she is knocked

out by an opponent, but then the opponents ability is

drawn a fresh from the same normal distribution with the

same mean.

This is two period model.

Uh, we can solve it backwards.

So we start in period two and two.

Uh, the whoever holds office, uh, only, uh, needs to,

uh, choose, uh, rent.

If she chooses the strategy implicitly chooses, uh, a level

of, uh, of spending for that for the electric.

The electric.

Uh, you know, this is the last period.

So all incumbents, simply two, will set the maximum level

of rents.

Rents are capped at R bar and then expected the

utility of spending from the viewpoint of voters on taxes

minus those rents extracted, plus the expected value of the

ability of the government plus the expected value of productivity.

But that is zero.

So this is the number and where the future, um,

future government can be the incumbent or the opponent.

So the utility of the electorate in period two is

the income.

That's the taxes they paid.

Plus uh, alpha times this expected level of government spending.

And here we see that.

Voters like more able politicians.

Why?

Because more able politicians are more productive in giving them

high rank for the buck, for the taxes they pay,

they get more, more utility spending.

So, uh, they have an incentive to learn about the

ability of politicians and to reward the one they like

or they think have the highest expected ability with their

vote.

That's what pollsters want to do.

So and they will have an optimal voting strategy.

Incumbent as expected.

Uh, ability uh, equal to expected ability that you learned

in period one.

The opponent has expected ability at a bar, but she's

drawn a fresh.

So when are you going to vote for the.

Incumbent.

You're going to do that if your dislike for the

incumbent remember.

Uh, Sigma I was the idiosyncratic dislike for the incumbent.

You can be positive or negative is smaller than the

expected ability to gain from selecting the incumbent rather than

taking it back down the right.

And since this is, uh, distributed in the population, uh,

you know, we get the kind of swing voter result

here that the vote share of the incumbent is one

half plus this number, which depends on the.

Intent of the distance and expected ability may come from

normal.

Okay.

So this is the the vote share.

And then the name of the game would be to

derive this expectation of the of the voters.

And we'll make it.

We consider two cases to make the point.

Uh, so we consider the uh, one case with informed

voters and one case with uninformed, informed voters will observe.

The spending that, uh, they're subject to.

That's not true, because I suppose has their own utility,

but they will also observe this product.

Remember that all the noise in the relation between ability.

And, uh, energy.

Contrast that case with uninformed voters who will observe only

you, and they will have to grapple with this learning

under the incomplete information.

So they will form two different expectations about ability, one

conditional on new and one for information.

Let's do the informed voters.

It's a little bit start algebraically to complicate it, but

it's conceptually a little bit.

So slow down a little bit and you'll stop me

if I'm not making sense.

So the.

Doctors.

Have a learning problem.

Given, uh, the this equation 11, which was just a

relation that determined, gee, they can perfectly gauge incompatibility in

this case, that is from the, uh, given some expectation

about about how many rents that the that the incumbent

will extract, which will be rational expectations, you can just

solve that equation and infer ability as the spending that

you see less, the taxes that you pay, plus the

expected, uh, uh, resources drawn from you minus this productivity

shock which you observe because your inform fully informed.

So this is what the the voters how they will

form their expectation about about the incumbent.

We now go to the incumbent and uh, ask yourself,

how would she take, uh, rents in the first period?

Then when the incumbent sets that aspect of policy, she's

uncertain about what ability she will turn out to have.

She she also doesn't know the realisation of this, uh,

productivity shock because she has to make policy choices next

time so she doesn't know.

So in fact, she has to form an expectation about

voter expectations in the future.

And let me use this, uh, this, uh, Gothic e

to denote the expectations about the expectations in the mind

of the incumbent when they have to think about what

to do, knowing that, uh, the public will make inference

once they observe.

This is those expectations about expectations.

But then when the incumbent knows how they are formed

like that, and when she makes pixel choice of R,

uh, she takes the voters expectation about, ah, otherwise we

would be assuming command and.

So now given how about just following the expectations given?

Given the vote share that we derived, and given this

relation in government policy, you can just crank out, uh,

the uh, the vote share, uh, that the incumbent can

expect depends on these entities this way.

So it includes a realised, uh, ability minus the opponents

ability.

And then it includes the difference between what she actually

does and what the voters expect her to do.

That's not quite there because we are interested in the

probability of winning.

And this is an uncertain object because I don't know,

uh, what it is yet.

Right.

So I have to derive the probability my probability of

winning has the probability taken over realisations of, uh, of

that ability shock that my vote share is about one

half.

And, uh, that is going to be, uh, when ETA

one.

Is above this sum over here.

Right.

Because then the about genuine about one half.

So for high realisations of ability uh, I will win

low realisations.

I will not win.

And my, my probability of winning is the probability that

ETA is about this number.

And that's.

Given.

By the CDF.

Here the distribution function of a to or actually one

minus that CDF evaluated at that time.

Yeah.

So this is my probability of winning.

And now it's clear staring at that.

If I make a choice of rents here and they've

got higher choice of rents then I'm increasing this argument.

And since it's decreasing and decreasing my probability of winning

from my viewpoint.

Right.

So now we have all the ingredients we can look

at.

What's the optimal action for the incumbent.

You maximise uh your objective function over the choice of

brands given the relation that we have just derived.

And, uh, then we set R2 equal to r bar,

which is the equilibrium value, and we obtain that the

closed form solution kind of for for first period runs

is one over lowercase f uh times data.

I'm sorry, Tim, that we're just future friends and lowercase

f is just the PDF associated with.

This distribution.

Okay.

So equilibrium period one policy.

Uh, we can now evaluate it voters expectations or rationales

such that, uh R1 is equal to the expectation.

Uh, and the equilibrium value is one over F evaluated

at the mean times this future price.

That's not so interesting in and of itself.

The interesting thing will be to compare it with the

case where when the voters are less informed, less will

fail.

Um, it's a.

It's a.

Kind of positive implications, you know, when electoral rewards are

smaller.

Namely, when are they at that time or symbol.

That's the future price you get if you win the

election or they are smaller, you extract more rents.

And when electoral uncertainty is bigger, which would be the

case when F is flat, they're going to steal more

or less some reminiscence of what we.

And here is, you know, even though this is not

how how robust and but derived in the paper here

is, uh, the.

Conclusion apropos, uh, political business cycles is kind of the

same.

Like if you had, you know, data from this society,

over time, you would see realisations of high spending and

low spending and, uh, you will see, uh, voting results,

and you would see a positive correlation when there was

a high spending level before the election, then the the

incumbent would tend to be re-elected.

And when there were lower realisations of spending before.

The.

Election and the incumbent would not be here.

So that's can be interpreted as a backward looking result

of a backward looking strategy of the voters.

But that's not what's going on in the model whose

equilibrium we have solved for here.

Here it's forward looking voters who vote prospectively or learn

about ability of politicians.

And they're acting upon, uh, the result of that learning

in the voting.

I don't know how sensational that is, but at the

time it was a degree by 5%.

Uh, so.

And that prospective strategy still creates an intertemporal trade-off for

the incumbent.

Uh, and she will be disciplined to some degree because

she realises that she will be judged exposed uh, under

also.

Uh, before.

Now we can do the, the the hanging from voters.

So now the voters only CG they don't see the

noise.

Uh, so.

Can you.

So they can no longer engage?

Uh, the ability perfectly of the incumbent.

Uh, but since they see spending, they see the taxes

they pay.

They have an expectation about the about how many rents

the incumbent will extract.

They can make an inference of the sum of ability

and productivity.

They don't see this.

So you have to make a guess.

Now an informed guess about the.

So how do they make that informed?

Yes.

So I'm assuming that voters form an optimal estimate of,

uh, uh, of a given that they see is, uh,

some and that they know the unconditional prior.

So this is not cheap talk.

There is actually an appendix to these notes where I

show how to derive the optimal kind of or less

estimate of, uh, of theta one, uh, given that they

see the some and you and shouldn't come as a

surprise that when you resolve that, uh, you get the

kind of signal and noise, uh, uh, problem that the

authors are facing.

So they are going to, uh, form, what, a weighted

average of, you know, the sum that they observed and

the prior that they have, which is a big number.

And the weights on those two, some to one.

And they are their relative size depends in a predictable

way on the relative noise in the, in the, in

the productivity shock and in the, uh, shock to the,

to the relative.

And in particular see that once the, the the shock,

the variance of the productivity shock goes to zero and

away from the some goes to one and the weight

on on the prior goes to zero.

And the opposite case when there's little variability in in

there.

So the observation of of G is less valuable to

learn about.

Uh about ability is more noisy.

Yes.

Now we can redo the same steps as we did

in the inform motor case.

It is no different except that we have to keep

track of these different learning.

So we can forms an expectation about voters expectation again.

You know this outside expectation and gets an anticipated vote

share which looks a little, uh, more complicated, but not

much.

It's the sum here that enters rather than than just

enter one.

And there's also this new term which is a number

lower than one.

So from the viewpoint of the incumbent when she chooses

how many Rams to pick.

You know votes will the vote share will respond less

to rent than when voters are fully informed because it's

subject.

Then you derive the probability of winning, uh, for the

incumbent, which is now the probability that the sum will

be above that number, which is the same number as

the one we have before.

So that's the we take the probability that you have

no challenges in half, which should be one minus k

evaluated at.

This term uh, anyway k is the cumulative distribution function

of the random variable eight plus q.

Uh, and eight days of normal.

The new is normal.

So it's normally distributed.

So this distribution would be the sum of those two

normal distributions, which has the mean which is equal to

the sum of the means namely at the bar and

with variance that is equal to the sum of the

variances which is just two variances.

So then we can derive the optimal policy given that

this is the probability of winning, and we get the.

The optimal rates being extracted is one over this number

with k is the pdf associated operator.

So this is just.

Um then we impose rational expectations and we get this

final expression for the of the Rams.

Uh, that will be expected in this case.

And now we can make this comparison to the informed

Vote Boulder case.

And, uh, I mean, it's the same terms, except that

it's the density, uh, of K at a bar compared

to the density of S at the data.

So k, the distribution of the sum has the same

mean, but it has a larger variance than than f.

So if it has the same mean and variance it

must be flatter uh at that point.

Right.

So it must be a lower density.

So rents in other words must be higher.

Because they have a harder inference problem.

Uh, And this protects the incumbent.

She can withdraw more.

And she behaves not so much in the interest of

the voters.

She would have been, had they been more fully formed.

So that's, uh.

That's the end of the formalities.

Let me lean back and, uh, think a little bit

about, uh, applications of this way of reasoning.

And one, one thing we could do, of course, which

is very natural, is to say that some, some voters

are informed and some are uninformed.

So this would be like a combination of the two

cases that we have studied.

And what we would get is that a larger and

informed share, uh, would uh, means would mean larger rents

and a smaller vote in response to this.

Now here is.

You know, this is consistent with, uh, some of the

work that.

Uh, you may or may not know, you know, about

the work.

For us.

And, you know.

How do you feel?

Us.

And I haven't had a, uh, set of 3 or

4 paper, uh, papers, uh, on Brazil, which exploits, uh,

a very interesting reform in Brazil, where the federal government

instituted in 2003 by a constitutional provision, uh, uh, random

audits by municipal governments before or after the fact.

So Brazil has 5000 municipalities.

Uh, and so, uh, each week the federal government sent

out the task force, uh, to one of those or

a couple of those municipalities to check the books and

to check for withdrawing, um, monies.

Moreover, they take those, uh, those, um, policies randomly, uh,

on public TV by rolling a big lotto and, you

know, drawing municipality 3465 and winning offices.

You know, when I.

Was looking at this.

Uh, in the second week of May.

So, uh, and then, you know, these inspectors stayed for

a week.

They wrote a report where they reported the number of

corrupt acts that they have discovered in, in the municipal

parks.

Um, and you know by, by fact that these were

drawn by, drawn at random.

And by the fact that some of these inspections, the

inspections were for always for last year.

But in election years, some of these, uh, municipalities were,

you know, uh, inspected and the results was released before

the election in other places that they were revealed partially

because it was a rolling program.

So each month, new settlements.

That's a beautiful, uh, natural experiment from there.

Uh, you know what happens to a government that has

done the same number of corrupt acts?

It's just that in one case, the voters know about

it before the election.

In another case, they only know that after the election

that is too late.

So they are looking at, at the the punishment that

uh, um, about, uh, a mayor would get that has

managed over, you know, so many corrupt acts and keeping

that constant cause it is the case that people, uh,

where it has been revealed, you know, those incumbents, they

lose those, right?

But they also show that, you know, if there is

more local media coverage in the municipality, then that loss

of votes is, uh, is larger.

I think the the case is whether you have a

local radio station or not.

So you can think about, you know, the, uh, the

share of informed voters as being related to the presence.

Of.

The of the radio station.

It's a long story, but it's a beautiful, beautifully executed

piece.

They don't have a theory in, in that, uh, in

that theory section of that paper is in the are

no.

2008.

Uh, but if they had a theory section, section, it

would be this model with uh, or it could be

this model informed.

Um, they also, by the way, uh, yeah, they did

this a series of papers and, uh, another, uh.

Yeah.

Let me tell you what.

Yeah, no, this reminds me a bit also of the

paper by Casey.

Uh, Catherine Casey on crossing party lines, but it was

more about the voters get more radio coverage then they

vote less according to to their ethnic allegiance, and more

because the candidate was more competent.

And there was also this noise signal theory behind it.

Very simple like.

But I think maybe the first paper is, uh, David,

strong bias, uh, um, job market paper in this, uh,

2000, uh, it's about Roosevelt's Federal Federal Reserve and the,

uh, his initiative to help states out during the, uh,

the 30s depression.

And there was federal relief aid being paid out.

Uh, and, you know, he has to say David has

a cynical political theory, uh, about this, that, you know,

this is partly done for or the distribution, this health

is done partly to garner votes.

And this shows that where you have local media, you

know, 1930s is where you're just developing radio stations.

Some places have been some place do not the radio

radio places.

Number of David Yang has a paper on the on

the one uh uh uh uh genocide uh which also

involves.

Variation.

In radio coverage, not because of the radio station, but

because one is the land of a thousand hills.

So some are in radio shadow.

Others.

Yeah.

Well, it's kind of imagine imaginative papers with radio.

And I think this one, the one I told you

about, it's the.

bill.

So that's that's one extension.

Another extension um, would be to embed this in a

multi variable.

So this is in fact uh what the bloggers inside

that did to derive that the electoral cycle.

So then you have to assume that, you know there's

some moving average process for a BP uh over time

such so ability can perhaps change.

But, you know, uh, the most relevant information is the

latest information that causes the moving average process.

So therefore, voters will pay close attention to what happens

in the year just before the election.

And then the incentives would be strongest for the for

the incumbent to the benefit of the voters just before

the election.

So you will see an increase.

That is to say, unless there is a term limit

on the on the income, because this reasoning is that

the, you know, the incumbent is trying to impress the

voters because she wants to get re-elected.

So if she is subject to a term limit.

And she wouldn't be doing it because, uh, that cynical

reasoning wouldn't hold, then it would have to be a

more complicated story about passing on a reputation, uh, to

the ordinary party or something like that.

That's a good idea.

In fact, term limits.

The first paper on that is a paper by Tim

Bastian.

And case, this first paper I know about where they

sort of have a similar setting.

Not quite what, but what.

We have.

Just shown you, but not too far away.

And we are governors in US states, uh, are investigated

empirically.

And as you know, they are 2 to 2 times

the common limit for the for the for governors in

US states.

Arkansas has one term, uh, only.

And I think there is a state that doesn't have

any term limits.

I don't, but anyway, they show that the, the, the

electoral cycle is they define with uh, also some spending

relative to normal is seen only for the governments that

do not say the term.

In fact, another paper in the federal um, uh, program

looks at mayors that are or are not limited by.

I mean, Maybe that's true in Brazil as well for

these mayoral elections.

And again, you see, uh, you see better behaviour, uh,

before the elections among uh, mayors that are not subject

to of.

Course, we have assumed that the ability is not known

by the incumbent.

If it is known by the incumbent, then she will

have incentives to signal availability.

And that way, in the wonderful world of signalling games,

this is how Rogoff inside but wrote the original paper.

Uh, interestingly, subsequent work for simulation.

And this is.

Yeah, here you have to face the, uh, multiplicity of

equilibria.

You have to choose a refinement, uh, of the signalling

game and then you can get some.

Hey, I think this is, uh, what I want you

to say this.

Appendix bacteria results on the all access today.

So.

Couldn't take you with that.

Instead, I'm going to give you 15 minutes way and

remind you that next week, if you're coming, uh, it's

the same room.

At the same time.

Tuesday I.

Think this is more of a yes.

There's nothing more.

Yeah.

Thank you.

Yeah.

What are you doing for the rest of the day?

But I'm.

Trying to work after three hours of lecturing.

Yes.

Normally.

Respond to emails.

We're going to some seminar today.

Okay.

Because I've got six hours of listening to this.

It's not as hard as teaching.

Six hours of.

My great theory before this.

Who's teaching?

Michael.

At the moment, it's Matt Levy.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Thank you.

See you next week.

Yeah.

Hello.

Lecture 4:

Right.

Sorry.

Okay.

So, do we know if something else is going on?

Okay.

I know.

That you're not even.

Making.

These questions before the class.

In any of these models like the thing of kind

of workhorse models we see, are there any work like

using them with some kind of maximisation function from recession

problems like inflation and things like that?

I'm just wondering, there's something like that.

I think that's, uh, a an area of largely unexploited

arbitrage.

Um, you know, there is, uh, literature and AI in,

um.

Going back to the march, uh, who argued that the

firm is the larger firms, a political organisation?

Uh, I'm not sure that the morals we have gone

through are the right way of approaching, but certainly, uh,

there is a political, uh, approach to how firms.

Put out conflicting interests.

And if you think about I have a paper just

published with last year here in the general organisation.

Yeah.

Which is about, you know, how the firms organise.

Given that there may be conflicting goods.

Um, uh, it's a little bit of how.

To substitutions in order to sort out, uh, uh, citizens

and how those organisations, what it takes nationally may or

may not serve some interests like that often similar issues

or conflicts of interest between the CEO and the board,

perhaps of the owners more generally.

And then there would be between the employees and the

leadership that, you know, that would affect how one gets,

how the term gets organised.

It was what March was groping uh, for a formalised

uh.

And sometimes some sort of, uh.

I think we agree, but come down.

Anyway.

So today, um, we're going to shift gears the first

two weeks.

That was the first week you had.

It was, uh, were mostly how people use, uh, simple

theory about how political processes result.

Now I'm going to shift gears completely and give you

an entirely empirical approach, trying to illustrate how one can

use.

trouvé to investigate, uh, some classical issues in, in political

economics.

Uh, here I'm going to, uh, uh, the less respectful

of other people's work and project from my own attempts

of doing so.

So I'll, um, report to you from the from about

four papers on the general question of selection in Swedish

politics.

And we it's essentially the same day, but we made

a big data collection effort in the mid 2000, 20

teens.

And, uh, that served to be, uh, turn out to

be a good investment.

Uh, so it's all about selection, uh, as it comes

out in Swedish politics And, you know, there are some

immediate questions which are like, who gets elected as politicians

and in particular political leaders.

And then, you know, also something about the drivers and

the consequences of that selection.

But then, you know, the reason we're interested in political

selection is that it somehow takes the temperature and how

well democracy works.

And there are questions such as, if you want broad

representation in the in the political class of different groups

in the population, does that come up, the price of,

you know, uh, ability among the politicians that served?

So some direct questions and some some broader questions in

the background.

And the common denominator is, is, as I said, is

status, uh, which is essentially registered as administrative data for

all politicians, uh, whether they're national note that whether they're

municipal or wherever and a ballot on any party in

any elections since 1982.

Uh, so that's the and then joining that up with,

with other microdata so we can compare the population.

And that's the basic idea behind this data collection effort.

Um, and uh, so actually what I talk about today

is going to be largely this, this descriptive, uh, I'm

not sure it's it's good advice to do descriptive work

as a PhD student, but in some applications it's it's

good advice perhaps, but for, for faculty to do that,

but in particular in cases where we know very little

about.

You know, how the man really looks like.

You know, modern economics right there.

You know, sophisticated theoretical work or sophisticated empirical work.

Meaning, you know, a nice identification strategy.

But before you write down a sexy theory or before

you, you you design an identification strategy, you need to

know the basic facts.

And in this field, we do, you know, the basic

facts.

Uh, okay.

I'll talk more about that, uh, as we go.

So today I'll talk about two pieces of work.

One is entitled Who Becomes a politician, published, uh, six,

seven years ago now.

And the you know, it asks the basic question how

selection.

Uh, depends on ability.

So how clever are the politicians, uh, that represent us

in this country, at least?

And you know, what social background do they have?

Uh, then after the break, we'll talk about this paper

on, uh, from the Review of Economic Studies, which was

published just a little less than a year ago.

Uh, that is also about selection, but selection into, uh,

a Swedish party that is a good representative for the

populist.

Radical.

Right?

Uh, that now seems to put up its head in

many political systems, uh, around the globe.

And so who becomes a politician who gets mobilised into,

uh, into such parties and, uh, who vote for those

parties?

And, you know, is there a square between them?

Between the two?

Next week we'll talk about two other papers.

Uh, one is about, you know, how local party leaders

are selected in in particular, how popularity in the electorate

matters for being, uh, selected as a local party leader.

And the other, uh, paper is about, uh, how leaders

pick followers.

They have an undue influence on who.

Who else will be on the ballot?

Uh, except themselves and in particular, how do they choose

ability and gender of the representatives, uh, on the ballot.

And this has as an intriguing title, which grew out

of a conversation we had with the Swedish leading female

politician, who looked at an instance of gender quotas, uh,

and said that informally, it was known in the Institute

as the crisis of the mediocre man.

Uh, anyway, so that that would post the question about

whether quotas in politics, uh, you know, necessarily infringe on

on ability of some people who are phosphorus critics or

quotas would have it.

All right.

So, um, the first paper, uh, has, you know, the

Swedish contingent that is always there.

My, my co-author, Sullivan, can or is in the political

science department in Uppsala.

Johanna is at Stockholm University, but in a different place

than I am.

And I've read are in a very, um.

So, um.

Very, very broadly.

One can say that to motivate this research that the

selection of politicians is the key to democracy or how

democracy works.

Yeah.

What's the role of politics in general?

It's basically two things.

But, uh, you know, one is to aggregate information about

possible consequences, uh, of facts into public policies, uh, decisions

that information aggregation stuff.

We haven't talked about that so far.

But, you know, we'll talk more about this as the

course go along.

The other one is preference aggregation.

People have conflicting interests.

Uh, they some would like high taxes, others like low

taxes.

And we somehow have to come to a compromise.

And, you know, so we have to aggregate those conflicting

preferences one way or And one can argue that the

selection of politicians are key to both.

I guess we will.

Almost any model will say that if people are more

able or more competent, then they'll be better at aggregating

information into a public policy decision.

Um, but if we had conflicts of interests, uh, one

can say that at least from, you know, from our

point of view and, and under a veil of ignorance,

we would be better served on a set of balance

interests.

Uh, maybe in the actual fact would rather have some

someone to represent us do it.

But from the viewpoint of the system as a whole,

uh, it is better with a more balanced group.

And, uh, Also, to have a more balanced group may

be better when aggregating information, because then, you know, you

take account of, of different, uh, experience and different, uh,

knowledge that will be spread in the population.

So the groups are well represented, all those views.

Uh, yeah.

That's a version of that control surgery theory.

Uh, I think so.

The the big question is somehow can ability and representation

be combined?

Uh, there are many hypotheses about this, but, uh, at

least when we started working on this, it was severely,

empirically under researched.

And one important reason for that, um, the research is

backward appropriate.

This hasn't stopped political scientists and economists from from coming

up with all sorts of ideas about how selection may

happen in a democracy.

So there is one school on self-selection, or one set

of papers and books into about self-selection into politics.

That sort of strikes a pretty pessimistic note.

So, you know, my answer also is a book about

the logic of collective action.

Maintain that because of a free rider problem, you know,

people are putting the best people in select themselves into

politics.

Let someone else do, because I'm still a benefactor.

Uh, Francesco Casali has written a paper on this, uh,

with, uh, Massimo Morelli, uh, on adverse selection, which reaches

the same kind of conclusion.

The Leo Key, classical political scientist, wrote about empirically about

politics in the South, and he was very simplistic about

how corrupt politicians are overrepresented in that situation.

More modern works, such as Nest and Bobo, try to

look at both forces of adverse selection and free riding,

and they also maintain that we should see kind of

negative selection, perhaps is not the Queen students that a

lot of these papers are written by people with a

with Italian origin.

And, you know, there are also, uh, papers about the

US South.

And, you know, maybe that has inspired people to be

pessimistic about the selection of politician that is somehow another

set of, uh, papers that, uh, say that that's all

fine, but these are extrinsic incentives.

Uh, there are also intrinsic, uh, incentives, in particular intrinsic

motivation.

And that may lead able people to get engaged in

politics.

The first paper on that theme is by Patrick Francois,

uh, 25 years ago.

And, you know, Timothy has some work with Patricia Park

or LSC papers, also paid for by volunteers.

All of this history.

So, uh, perhaps not all hope is gone.

There are also some more specific hypotheses that, you know,

depending on the kind of electoral system the country puts

in place, we'll see that, uh, the selection being biased

in one way or another.

In particular, there's a, uh, a number of papers.

I just listed a few here that talks about How?

Well, majoritarian system versus proportional electoral systems, uh, foster representation,

even representation in the in the system and how well

they foster accountability.

And this is a relatively short step from accountability to

ability, uh, if elections fulfil the role of selecting people.

As we discussed last week.

Right.

Uh, and the general notion is that, you know, political

representation favours even representation, whereas majoritarian elections favours accountability.

And therefore I think would be more.

But again, some of the research and, you know, earlier

work, empirical work on the topic has right there is

shortcuts.

So there are some very cool papers on the selection.

So I've just listed a few examples here.

So one by Meyer, Dan Meyer, uh, Michael Keane and

Antonio Merlo uh, are 2005.

They have a dynamic discrete choice model of how people

enter and exit uh, uh, careers as congressional politicians.

What makes them stay in the in the game?

It's a position more likely to stay in the game.

And if they do not, then you know, when do

they exit and why?

The only problem is that this is the highly selected

sample.

In particular.

They only look at the people who have been elected

to the US Congress.

And somehow the basic issue is who gets elected to

the He was clearly approachable by that approach.

But it's a it's a very nice structured dynamic, these

creatures.

Yeah.

So that that's that's sort of the scope of the

data and other is the kind of measurement if you're

interested in ability, which some people are being.

There are nice papers by our co-authors, uh, in past

work.

Those and they're still on thread on this, uh, it's

a good paper by Vincenzo and, uh, Salvador and Eugenie.

Uh, but they use things like.

Well, they use education as a proxy for ability.

Um, but, you know, if you're asking about, uh, how

selection reflects ability and as social background is education and

natural ability is the measure of social background in many

societies, it's both.

So that doesn't seem to be a, uh, a workable

avenue if one is interested in such question.

And when we started, as I said, there were no

studies of politicians versus the full population or even in

groups.

That's what we decided to do.

So as I mentioned, we will work with all Swedish

municipal and parliamentary politicians and all lists in all parties

in all elections since 1982 and will use detailed measures

of ability and social background.

Um, and we'll compare these guys who get into politics

with the full population and for a good measure, with

some other questions.

So you know where we're going.

Uh, what the main questions are and what we find.

So is there selection and ability?

The answer is largely yes.

And moreover, the selection seems to monotonic in political power.

So the more political power the position is about, the

more favourable the stomach.

Uh, for politicians.

Now, this in itself could be either the result of

meritocratic selection, or it could be the result of an

elite that keeps reducing itself.

Which is fine to pick its kind of meritocracy.

Uh, at least that's what our two Berkeley co-authors, who

are both have roots in Latin America like to call

me sweet.

So by ability, you mean ability to implement.

Ability.

You see the measures in two slides down?

Um, yeah.

Measures of how able people are in.

IQ sense in in.

You know how well they do in other, um, uh,

parts of life, in particular in the labour market.

That's one measure and one is a measure of the

social intelligence.

Social mobility.

Uh.

Are people or politicians representative for the full population?

Basically, the answer is yes.

Is there an important trade off between ability and representation?

Uh, in the sense, of course, it's going to be

the same electoral system.

So it doesn't have any bearing on that.

But, you know, in places where the politicians are more

able or they're also less successful, it turns out to

be quantitatively true, but not really quantitatively important.

Um, and then what are the drivers is not what

the paper is about is largely descriptive, but I did

show you some result correlations that suggest that both self-selection

and quality screening is involved in.

This selection process.

So here is what I want to do.

First show you the data, give some background, then investigate

the selection of mobility.

Question.

Ask about meritocracy or elitism.

This prospective trade off.

And.

So I want this to get the numbers up.

We're going to exploit local informatics.

Uh, so we're going to look at Swedish municipalities.

And you you may wonder, you know, based on some

other countries, maybe this low level of politics, what is

it they do with their local trash collection?

Uh, so it's important to, to, uh, to look at

that.

It is the lowest level of political organisation.

So there would be 290 units of different size would

be the biggest.

That's the municipality, at least.

Inner city.

That's about the million.

I'm the smallest.

Uh, these are about 2 to 3000.

Yet they have responsibility for all of them.

Have responsibility for certain public services.

So pre-school, we should say these days.

Take care.

Uh, schools from kindergarten to to high school.

Uh, old age care and local infrastructure are to be

legally provided by the municipal.

And then, uh, they also have the right to charge

an independently determined income tax.

So that's how they finance their activities.

Uh, and then there's some, some grants from the, from

the central government, but that's a minority finance.

And if you want to get a summary measure of,

uh, you know, how important they are in the economy,

you can do that either by looking at the share

of spending that goes through these municipal, uh, um, decisions.

You can look at the share of people, uh, who

are employed in municipalities as shareholder employment.

Or you can look at the income tax rate that

they they charge and whatever whichever of these three measures

you are, you end up with something like a $50

bill.

Yeah, I would say important.

That, you know, uh, how good they are at the

company.

Uh, how does the the, the a municipal political system

work?

It works like, you know, essentially the, the central system

in Sweden, which is a parliamentary system.

So there would be, uh, like, you know, there's a

parliament, national parliament elected, there would be, uh, a council,

I mean, municipal council elected to be elected by proportional

representation from lists that are drawn up by the local

parties.

So they have to make an independent selection of who

is on the ballot.

And these elections happen every four years, and they are

synchronised in time with, uh, with the national elections, which

means that there's a high turnout rate.

And last time around it was probably 84 to 94,

86 and somewhere between 80 and 90.

And, uh.

Then, you know, it would be because it's PR, it's

something like between 5 and 10 parties, uh, typically 8

or 9.

Uh, and, uh, you know, based on the election, election

result, coalition has to that has to be formed.

That coalition appoints council board, which is like the the

government international, uh, national context and that majority coalition will

dominate the Municipal committees on various issues, and they will

propose a budget.

And then there is corresponding to the Prime Minister.

The top politicians in the largest party in the majority

coalition becomes what we might call the mayor.

So call the mayor in direct translation, and it's the

chair of the council board.

On that slide, the local governments.

So it works like a metric system.

Nevertheless, unlike in national parliament, municipal politicians are not politicians.

They are what we call measure politicians, uh, meaning that

they are mostly reimbursed for their direct costs.

And, you know, uh, uh, per diem for, for an

afternoon's and for the local council.

So opportunity cost may Maybe, maybe a working incentive on

the politicians.

Of course, some people go into local politics in order

to kick start a political career.

So in 2000, the 2010 national parliament, 72% of those

that served had previously served from the same party in

the local municipal council.

But that's 250 people, roughly.

Uh, 72% of 349 parliamentarians, and there are 13,001 three,

uh, 13,000 local politicians.

So this is certainly not for everybody.

Uh, and so it's not the major motivation.

Now, Uh.

I said not full time politicians.

That doesn't hold for the mayor.

Uh, they would typically be at least one, sometimes two

full time salaried positions in Stockholm.

There would be four, um, who get the full time

salary from the municipality.

And, uh, that salary is pretty good.

It's set by the municipality itself.

So not dictated.

By the national government.

And the typically put people in the top, very top

percentile of the national income distribution.

So it's an economically lucrative position.

Uh, plus, of course, there's a lot of power and

prestige in the local community being in the way.

So what?

Is the background.

What's the data?

So, uh, so after ethical clearance, we got, uh, green

light to put together information from a variety of sources.

And the key to do this was that we found

that the election authority keeps all the ballots.

Uh, they need to be delivered to the election authority

to be valid, uh, instruments in the elections.

And they saved them.

Uh, so, uh, we digitised all of it.

And, uh, the important thing in the in the metadata

there is the person personal identifier, uh, tied to each

politician.

Everyone in Sweden has a special number, which means a

personal number, which sort of he's registered in.

All in all, uh, national statistics.

We don't get that number.

Um, how do we get the running time we can

use to identify, keep track?

Because that that, uh, running number that the statistics we

then gives us will also appear so that we can

identify people's age, their gender, their education, their occupation, their

earnings, uh, in annual data, uh, from various tax records

and census type things.

Um, so we have that for the not only for

the politicians, but for the whole population.

Uh, for the interesting period.

We know who is a brother or sister of, uh,

of whom and who is and who is, uh, a

cousin of who, if we want to from the family,

from the Market generational registers and for measuring ability, since

you ask, we have these individual mental capacity scores for

every 18 year old, uh, man, uh, from the defence

recruitment agency up until the 90s, uh, at least the

mid 90s, uh, every 18 year old, sometimes 19 year

old went through these tests for, uh, one and a

half days, uh, to screen the, uh, national transfers.

So, um.

When we started, uh, big data wasn't such a big

thing, but now we will talk about it.

I guess this is a big day for, uh, about

14 million unique individuals.

Uh, out of which about, um, 200,000 population.

For me, maybe the most exotic or the most unusual

data.

Uh, some of you may have seen it, and they've

been used in labour papers, uh, in, in the, in

the past.

Uh, all these enlistment scores.

So there is a cognitive cognitive score, which is based

on, uh, kind of conventional intelligence tests with verifiable logical

like infestations, spatial, spatial, hyper components.

Uh, so that's an inner test of innate mental ability.

And uh, as many psychologists do, this is scored on

a one through nine scale that is, uh, adapted so

as to mimic a normal distribution is called as timeline,

it's timeline scale.

And then at least people who scored in the upper

half or above, Including five.

Um, on this test, they get a deep interview with

the psychologist.

And that goes on for I've done this and obviously

I'm in the data set since everyone is.

And I still remember when this happened when I was

18.

So I sat with this psychologist.

I answered hundreds of questions.

I didn't know exactly what he was checking at the

time, although I wrote my high school essay on, uh,

IQ tests.

But, uh, anyway, this was the sort of the leadership

test, and but I've since understood that, you know, this

was kind of a big five, uh, related personality traits.

So they are trying not to find a gang who

fighters, but rather people who are good at getting other

people to cooperate.

That's officer material.

And that's why leadership tests.

Supposedly this is also useful if you are a politician.

Um.

Also, because this is only for men.

We badly wanted a measure that applies also to be

the more important gender.

Uh, so, um, we developed in another paper, which I'll

actually talk about next, next week, uh, so-called measure of.

Uh, of ability from labour market earnings.

So if you have a full time position in politics,

we strike those out because that would be circular.

But we look at people's payments or earnings in the

in the labour market.

And then we estimate that Which means the regression.

You know, which, uh, equation?

Uh, based on panel data for the for the whole

population.

So in particular, we allow, uh, wages to be to

be systematically related to cohorts to employment sectors, years of

education, uh, experience the municipality where you live, your gender

because it's different wage setting for men and women and

then also interactions of all of these terms.

So it's fully saturated specification, uh, so as to allow

for any nonlinearities.

And this way we explain or uh, sort of uh,

yeah, explain kind of within quotation marks, um, 55 to

60% of the variation in our race.

Okay.

So then what we do is that we take the

residuals from those, uh, these estimated regression, and then we

sum the residuals for each individual all the time, as

long as we have the data for that individual.

So it's a measure of how well people are doing

earnings wise relative to other people in the same little

cell.

So if I have a high earnings score, it's not

because I'm a professor and someone else is a welder.

It's because among professors, uh, who have, uh, 30 years

of experience and live in Stockholm, I have a higher

wage than the others in that situation.

Uh, so it's always relative to to the that Narrowly

defined group in the.

In this other paper we try to validate the measure.

So we say we show that it explains both political

success and in fact it also uh correlates with municipal

service delivery.

So if your municipal council has a people with higher

earnings scores, then people are more satisfied that the services

that yes, we're getting very small sales for some of

these sorry, very small sales for some of these like

sales of one.

Yeah.

But I mean, uh, it's uh, 14 million people.

And, uh, you know, you can have quite a few

combinations.

So, uh, I think we do for four types of

education rather than years of education, actually, uh, and, uh,

Employment sector.

That's 1516 year old sectors.

Municipalities are accumulating.

So I guess for some of the smaller municipalities, the

few individuals you know in it's there, we we don't

consider that standard.

Question so much when they are it's when they're biased.

I don't think they are particularly wise okay.

So here is um, how they correlate with each other.

So it's, you know, in a in, in a at

the moment we come in to write down the ability

of someone and call it a well defined, the ability.

But if you think about measuring ability empirically Of course,

if you look at a person's IQ that's different from

their social skills, and if you look at how well

people are sort of manifesting their skills in the labour

market, that's yet another dimension.

And you can see that these are correlated, positively correlated,

that we should expect that typically on the order of

0.3, 0.5 is the highest.

But that's with Pearson Education's measure.

And the earnings score in principle should, uh, should be

uncorrelated, uh, with years of education because it goes into

the measure.

But I think it's this years of education is is

a yearly measure where I say those four steps.

So some really positive correlation.

But these are different aspects of a business.

So that could be a problem if we have very

different results.

but you will see the results we get are exactly

the same, qualitatively and actually largely quantitatively as well, independently

of each measure.

And an interesting measure in.

Some way.

Um.

So the other, uh, ability criterion or the other selection

criterion I said was social background.

So we can measure that two ways.

So now we'll do that in two different ways.

One is, uh, you know, as an economist would do

it, particularly after having read these, uh, uh, papers we

made popular, you know, that if we take the percentile

rank of someone, that's a sort of, uh, uh, known

Non-carbon are a measure of, uh.

Uh, your relative, uh, social background.

Um, so we're going to look at the income percentile

in 1979 of the parents to the politicians that we

observed towards the end of the sample and towards the

end of the sample.

Uh, you know, it so happens that this bank, 30

years from 1979 to, uh, to, uh, to now, um,

you know, 30 years is the average age of parenting.

So we're of course, it varies by individual, but on

average, we're measuring the income percentile of the parents in

at a stage of the life cycle.

Very similar to the politicians, of course.

The other way we do is how this is the

economist, where this is the sociologist way.

So in sociology, people use the classic classification scheme that

is based on class, which is kind of based on

what type of occupation you have.

You can look for a job if the blue collar

job is more intellectual or or manual job, etc..

So that is the perhaps the most famous scheme is

called the EGP scheme.

That stands for Ericksen, who was my neighbour in Stockholm.

Uh, Robert Ericsson, Swedish sociologist.

And it's, uh, this is uh.

Uh, famous sociologist.

And this is Porto Guerrero, who was a co-author on

and when they wrote, we just got the code from,

uh, one of the young sociologists, and we applied it

on the whole population.

Yes.

They will.

Okay.

So now let's after all this background, let's get to

the first result.

So this is the complicated diagram.

It shows, uh, the distribution of ability.

Uh, here is the IQ score, the, uh, the now

this is the leadership score.

So that's the this is social skills.

This is the cognitive score is the earning score.

And here is the distribution education.

Uh, for just for comparison, we can start by looking

at this diagram in the upper right corner.

And here what you see is that the transparent bars

the blue bars here.

That's the population.

And it's on a storyline scale.

I said it's supposed to be a normal.

It's not really completely normal.

It's this one is a little higher than that one.

And I think what that reflects is that we're taking

over, you know, we're averaging over all cohorts and people

with, uh, who are doing better in society.

They have better health and therefore they live longer.

So they're more, uh, around us.

But that would apply, of course, to politicians as well.

But anyway, so that's, that's the that's how the population

looks like.

And then we have drawn in a histogram for each

of four categories of politicians.

And here is how we are providing people into different

levels of Suppose so.

The the first one is that your naked eye?

You appear as a kind of a banner, but you

do not get that link.

That's the likeness, right?

Mostly to the left of these four bars, then the

slightly more grey or the inactive.

The dark grey would be the main, and the darkest

grey would be the prominent.

Very.

Clearly relative to the population.

These distributions of politicians are shifted to the right.

And it's a clean stochastically dominating.

Uh, it's much thicker, uh, right tail.

But then if you stare at this, you will see

that it's with one exception, I believe.

It's completely monotonic.

So the the people on the ballots.

There are fewer of them.

Score one on the cognitive test.

And there are more of them at scoring.

Nine.

Than in the population as a whole.

But if you compare them to the elected, there are

fewer of the elected in the in the one bin,

and there are more of the elected in the nine

bin.

And if you go to mayor.

Yeah.

And if you go to parliamentarian the monotonicity complement.

So in other words is better selection uh out of

the population into these uh layers of, of political power.

And notice here it does nothing to the data.

I'm just plotting it.

You know there's no transformation whatsoever.

It's just the raw data is very descriptive.

Awesome.

Great.

When we saw this first time in Joe as nice

a tiger.

Oh, it's going on.

So, um.

Anyway.

Yeah, it's just.

Man.

I'm just.

Yeah.

This is for.

Just for the man.

Right?

And if you look at the men and the women,

uh, when you have the earnings call, it looks exactly

the same here is not the raw data because the

earnings score is continuing.

Uh, I asked if the average Joe that we discussed.

So this is divided into standard deviation bins.

Okay.

So this is one standard deviation.

Now has a standard deviation of three standard deviations.

And the leadership score as you can see looks qualitatively

similar to the quality score.

So positive selection however will be measured.

Here is just a table for us to give a

bit of a perspective.

So here are the three ability measures.

And now I'm just computing means uh for each of

them.

Uh so the three first we the four first, we

already know this is the means of the of the

of these, uh, three measures.

Uh, so it's increasing, uh, in power, uh, for all

of them.

So, but now I've also put in some other, uh,

professions, CEOs of small companies, CSR, CEOs of mid-sized companies

and CEOs of large companies.

But in medical doctors, This is the most prestige has

been for 30 years the most prestige thing.

If you have full grades in all your high school

subjects, you're supposed to become.

Social.

Some people are motivated by lawyers and judges, and then,

for good measure, economists and political scientists and those who

are working in the university and the department.

Um, so if you compare here, take the.

Uh, kind of, uh.

Take the mayor, mayors here, uh, they have a leadership

score of 6.4.

And remember, you needed to be in the top 50%

of cognitive scoring or, uh, to be scored on this.

So they are evidently good.

In fact, they are Exactly as good as the CEO

of a medium sized company, just to get some some

reference point.

They're not as good.

Uh, neither has the medical doctors are in between.

In in leadership.

Uh, mayors and volunteers and all the difference, for sure.

Yeah, probably because there are many of them.

Uh, but they are not as high IQ.

Uh, they're not as high IQ as economists.

We have some debate.

How are we meant to interpret the ideas?

Go ahead.

I was in the school for a particular profession as

well.

Yeah.

Yeah.

So.

Exactly.

Yeah.

But you know, these other professions because these are based

on the earnings that people had before they became politicians.

So we're not using the political salary.

And these guys, they do nothing.

But of course, CEO is not one of those professions

that in the sense.

That you can doctor some profession.

Anyway, so, uh, that's just to get the perspective.

Now.

Now to the important question, you know, is it is

this this the result of meritocratic selection or is it

the result of, you know, uh, preoccupies these political positions?

So we try to do investigate that in two ways.

One is that we we hold family background concerned we

will look at people in the same family.

So siblings are so is it doesn't matter.

Uh, if you if for your likelihood of becoming a

politician, if you're more or less clever than.

So then obviously we're looking within within family.

So this would go in the direction.

Is that true.

Right.

And then of course we also ask whether socioeconomic background

directly drives selection.

So we're going to check the background of the parents

politicians post about others.

So here is, here is uh uh here is another

set of diagrams.

Mostly for the raw data.

So this role is for the elected municipal politician.

This role is for the mayors and this role is

for the parliament.

And then for each of the three abilities.

So as before the the the transparent broad bars as

the population always connection.

But then we have two, two bars.

Uh, one for the sibling of the elected politicians that's

light grey and one for the elected politicians politician herself.

And as you can see that this is a kind

of a version of what we saw before.

So relative to the population, the siblings of the politicians

are slightly better.

But.

Only slightly better in these things.

Whereas the elected politician herself.

That's distribution is shifted out relative to legacy.

That's true for the on the leadership score as well

as on the earnings call.

Uh, so in other words, you know, you're more likely

to become a politician if you're more clever than your

as measured by these three.

Three.

Uh, of course this is conditional having a sibling.

So some of the politicians.

Well, that was sort of some questions here about, um,

the market to be the first born or on up

and the possibility that the first one.

But that's not what's driving this distinction between siblings.

Um.

Um.

It's kind of interesting.

And you can ask the, the quantitative question, you know,

how much of the difference relative to the general population

between the general population and politician is driven by within

sibling, within the family selection.

And, of course, it matters depending on which measure you

have.

But for the elected politicians, we computed it.

And it's in between 70 and 80%, uh, of the

relative to population information that is explained, quote unquote, within

family selection.

So they seem to be a meritocratic volunteer.

If you start staring at these, you see there's an

impressive, uh, kind of thing.

The, um, in particular, there are some people here on

the among the parliamentarians that are somehow much better than

their sibling.

And there are three standard deviations out relative to the,

uh, to the average.

Okay.

So that's um, that's the within family comparison.

We don't just argue, sorry.

We argue instead that parliamentarians are more likely to come

from families that have such great sibling variation.

And yeah, maybe, uh, I mean, nothing of this is

causal, so, uh, um, but yeah, it's consistent with, uh,

you know, I guess you're thinking that this consider this

affects their upbringing and, uh, how they set their aspirations

in life.

May very well be true, but then we need more

data.

Shed light over here.

This is a direct, uh, look at the background of,

uh, of, uh, the, uh, fathers of the politicians.

We can do it from somewhere.

It looks similar.

So these are the look at the the first row

here.

This is for elected politicians, is for mayors, and this

is for parliamentarians.

So and this is the measure of the fathers in

1979 with reference to the politicians towards the end of

this up, and I have drawn in the uniform distribution

of the this is the the income percentiles are drawn

in the uniform distribution of the population, which by definition

sets at 1%.

And then I have drawn the the actual distribution of

the fathers of the elected politician and its undistinguishable from

from this 1% uniform distribution.

In other words, the elected politicians that you see as

village, uh, local politics is a replica of the populations

in terms of the background, social background measured by income

percentiles 30 or so for mayors.

You know, there are fewer.

So it's a bit more volatile, but it's pretty close

to the uniform distribution for parliamentarians.

You see a little overrepresentation at the top.

And on the representation on the bottom is still relatively,

uh, relatively Uniform, at least if you compare to some

other professions.

These are the doctors.

Uh, I mean, the income rank of the of their

fathers in 1979 and tends to go in the family

does to some degree, and doctors are pretty well.

But there are there is a very stark difference between

this one and, uh, also for CEOs in large companies

it's similar.

Right.

Okay.

But then this is all of this is now for

the collective entire collective of politicians.

And of course politicians come in different types.

They come from different parties.

Now let me look.

My party.

And in the left column here, we look at the

elected politicians themselves.

We know that they are doing better than the population.

So in terms of income percentile and distributed to the

to the right, even if they are social democratic politicians,

these are Centre Party politicians and these are conservative politicians.

Uh, all of them are overrepresented at, uh, at, uh,

the fathers their own incomes.

This is their own income.

Sorry.

These are the founders.

And here is where we're kind of becomes a little

bit cute.

Uh, these are the three largest parties over the time

period in local municipal, uh, get elected.

Municipally, the Social Democrats or the Social Democrats as the

centre left party, the Centre Party is big at the

countryside, often represents the old peasants interest Group party, so

they represent peasants and people who own small lots of

groups.

And the conservatives are the conservatives, the centre right.

And here is where it becomes cute.

If you look at the social background, the centre party

of these poor farmers, and therefore there's our kind of

over represented the bulk of the conservatives, over over 80%

families at the top and the Social Democrats over 8%,

if anything, people in the middle class.

So.

As we might expect to happen.

So it's not random.

Uh.

From which all of you come.

But I will represent that.

Okay.

Okay.

Next question is, is there a trade off between representation?

And, uh, of course, we only have one observation if

we look at the whole country.

So here we take advantage of the fact that it's

divided into municipalities.

Uh, so there's a spread of both ability, average ability

and average representation, uh, of politicians in different municipalities.

And so we can use those kind of, uh, uh,

check in those inequalities where We're more able politicians on

average.

Do they come from them better social backgrounds or not?

And, uh.

This picture kind of, uh, shows that.

So on the horizontal axis is the average leadership score

index.

And these are being made at 1294.

Uh, of that just to see better.

Um, so there is between, you know, point 6 to

1, uh.

Step above the, the population.

And now we're looking at the population in the municipality.

Uh, so each municipality is kind of one observation, uh,

and then we correlate that, uh, With, uh, father's, uh,

economic index.

This is the this is the class index, and this

is the income index.

So if there is a trade off between ability and

observation, we expect a positive slope and there is a

positive slope.

But then once you start looking at whether those slopes

are, are statistically significant, this is not standard errors within

uh within brackets and slope coefficient here.

This one is and this one is the other one.

And if you start looking at uh, you know what

these numbers mean.

There is a positive correlation on average, but is not

very much.

So why if there is a trade off, it's not

so easy.

So that's, uh, uh, again, asking the question and just

trying to describe the data.

Uh, and I think this is, uh, one way of

looking at it.

So here to, to make things simpler, I looked at,

uh, social background in terms of the father's income quartile

in 1979.

So the four quartiles of fathers and, uh, the cognitive

scores of the politicians nominated elected mayors and parliamentarians of

those fathers.

And as you can see, this is the this is

the population.

And as you can see, there is a slope here.

So, uh, if your father is from the highest, uh,

income quartile 30 years ago, then your average cognitive score

is higher than if he's in the first quarter.

And similarly for the leadership score, not so much for

that of our next score.

But at least for these values, there is a slope

there.

But then if you look at the these bars that

measure the, the abilities of the of the politicians, you

don't really see a slope.

You see that the slope that you already know, uh,

within each quartile across politicians.

But we already know that, uh, but this way, uh,

across, uh, the politicians, you don't see much of this

law.

So what that means, uh, or one way to think

about that is that selection is actually better from the

weakest social background is proportionately many, uh, clever people out

of the poorer social backgrounds get into the politician profession,

and that's an evening out force that sort of takes

care of part of this trade off between social background.

That's the best we could, could, could make.

Of course, the forces that lead to that remain to

be understood and investigated and thought about that is also

kind of surprising.

Uh, anyway.

So finally, um, let me say a few words about

the driver.

So this is when we submitted the paper.

Um, we submitted it once.

Uh, and I mean, I see in the revision, uh,

there it has been particularly like this part of it.

Uh, I'm going to talk to you about now.

Uh, and maybe he was right, but since it says

something about about drivers, uh, maybe, uh, I can still,

uh, talk about it a little bit.

So what could be the mechanism is between behind this

selection.

Well, there's obviously one moment of self selection.

So people.

Become members of audience.

They try to, to to to engage in politics.

And, uh, somehow they get mobilised.

And, uh, we could think that there are material motives

of doing so.

But also think about pro-social or intrinsic motives for for

engaging in politics.

But then once they are members of the local chapter

of the party and question arises, who is the party

going to put on the ballot?

And so politics screen.

So those kind of forces, uh, are the.

You know, facing the things we need to worry about.

So what we did was to write down a simple

selection or the role model that you have seen somehow

in the, in your education.

So let me tell you quickly how the model goes.

We have a bunch of risk neutral citizens who may

offer political service, or they may stay in the private

sector.

So suppose they have some ability.

Let's call the ability.

Why?

Let's also suppose that they have some, uh, intrinsic pro-social

motive that we call P, and there's some joint distribution

y SNPs in the population.

So each citizen is identified with a Y and a

P, and she has a two period horizon.

So you can live your life outside of politics.

So then you just earn your ability in period one.

And you expect to earn gamma times Y in the

two.

There is an occupation specific age earnings profile.

So depending on which you have chosen an occupation before

you make these choices, and depending on that, you can

expect a certain slope of your income profile over time.

Okay.

And we're going to be able to measure occupation specific

age earning profiles in the day, right?

If you're inside politics, then you will be elected to

council with probability.

Q.

Uh, that can depend on your ability.

If it's green positive, your own ability, you're more likely

to be a candidate in the first place.

And if voters know about your ability, maybe even more,

uh, likely to be elected.

If you get elected, then there's this kind of prosocial

intrinsic benefit which is equal to P over two period.

But then if you're in politics, you must give up

some private career.

Okay.

So you have to go to these council meetings, uh,

uh, once a week to appear in this committee in

some committee meetings.

That takes away time that you could otherwise spend with

your family or your job.

And as a result, you you earn your ability in

period one.

But since you're giving up some career, you only get

one minus delta times gamma y in period two.

So, you know, you face a flatter material earnings profile

if you go into into politics.

Um, and then if you're elected, you can become the

mayor in period two.

So make a political career quickly compensating for this lack

of private career.

And, uh, let's say that there is a party municipality

specific probability pi to become the mayor.

We can measure that.

How likely it is in different parties, in different municipalities

that you appoint the mayor, and then you earn a

municipality specific political wage.

This is the wage that we do in the upper

income percentile.

We can measure that.

Now that is plain sailing.

You self-select into politics.

Is that if that gives you a higher total payoff.

So this is what you get when you stay in

the private sector.

If you go into politics with some probability you're not

elected.

And then you're like in the private sector, but then

with some probability you are elected and you can get

that price in terms of the of the mayor's wage

with probability.

And, you know, you'll always earn this social benefit Depending

on how much you value.

And once you rewrite this, this equality, this inequality, uh,

it just gives a very natural prediction that you will

go into politics if your pro-social benefit P exceeds the

opportunity cost of being in politics in terms of private

income, adjusted for the probability of becoming a mayor.

Uh, and uh, uh, getting a wage gain of W

minus this, uh, private per day wage.

Right.

So the pro-social benefit must outweigh the expected material costs.

So now we can do comparative statics.

And those comparative statics would suggest some correlations to look.

the end.

So, uh.

So it would say that if that's what we showed,

um, in the.

Appendix.

Maybe not in working paper version of the of the

paper.

Uh, if P and Y is drawn from a joint

distribution, a higher w higher, uh, their wage, a higher

party specific probability of becoming the mayor and the lower

gamma all raise the ability of those that self-select into

politics.

And to the extent that there is positive party screening,

namely Q wise and increasing function, then those three comparative

statics also hold in equilibrium when it comes to the

observed.

So let's look at each of these correlations that you

suggested.

So here we are looking at uh, his municipality specific

mayoral wages.

Uh, so we're just running simple looking at simple correlations.

No attempt of identifying anything here.

Uh, so this is this is the, uh, people at

different ballot list ranks.

So, you know, it can be highest on the list.

It can be number two on list, number three on

the list or five on the list.

And if you're number one on the list, then you're

the mayor and candidate because you're leaving politicians with the

top position.

And we are correlating that with uh, well, this is

the regression coefficient on the on the mayor's wage divided

by the average wage in the US.

There's a positive correlation between the people on the top

of the list, their uh, uh ability and uh, and,

uh, marriage, um, both for the cognitive score and the

leadership score.

When you instead do the earnings score, uh, we get

a positive correlation for position one and position two all

the time.

I'm not arguing that we have proven anything, but this

information is consistent with the modern prediction.

This is, I think, uh, an interesting, uh, diagram that

I have, of course, having biased the perspective of.

on this on these results.

So anyway so this looks at this gamma prediction.

Gamma remembers the occupation specific wage earnings profile.

So we look at the slope of the you know

weekly I think it's nominal wages because it's same price

index for everyone uh in for people in different categories.

Okay.

And then on the so that's on the, on the

horizontal axis.

On the vertical axis is an a cognitive score index

of people who you see in uh, as politicians in

that, um, in that particular profession, these are different professions

and relative to the average person in that profession.

So here are the medical doctors and Commuting and have

a steep, uh, earnings profile, the highest one.

But if you compare that the politician that you see

elected to municipal council with the politicians that only you

only see in the hospital, and these guys, uh, in

politics, have a lower cognitive ability.

So here seemingly, you know, the material motive has been

to get negative selection, uh, among the doctors.

And I'm trying to be careful looking at the points

close to the axis so that I don't, uh, fool

you.

I mean, close to the regression line.

Look at the engineers here.

Uh, so they don't, uh, have as fast wage progression

as the medical doctors, but they still have a reasonably

fast 10% per period.

I don't remember exactly which period it is.

And now we're above zero on the cognitive score.

So the engineers in politics are slightly more clever than

those that are not in politics.

Now you look at these guys, the kindergarten teachers who

have a university education.

Unfortunately, things don't progress very rapidly for them wage wise.

But, uh, you know, so they are not giving up

so much wage progression if they're going to politics and

now they are considerably, uh, more inclined in politics than

if they're just working in pre-school.

So that's consistent with the this opportunity cost point about

earnings growth Having any influence in this selection.

Finally, how about the party specific promotion probabilities?

So here we do something very simple.

We just look at all the elections in the municipality

and for all the parties.

How many times did the party appoint the mayor?

If they never did it, the probability is 0% or

it's 100%.

If they say the Social Democrats always win in somewhere

up in the North.

Uh, and it can be low, low or, or high.

And then we look at the leadership scores, cognitive scores

and early scores of politicians, uh, relative to, uh, to

the people in the municipality.

And Yeah.

You do see some gradient here?

Uh, from low to high.

Uh, particularly for the top, uh, people on the list

are increasing.

Increasing?

Uh, um.

Leadership scores, cognitive scores, earning scores.

But that's not really what stands out, uh, from this

table.

Because for the party, even for the parties that have

0% of becoming a politician, uh, and who wouldn't have

gotten into politics according to the law unless they had

a strong pro-social vote in doing so?

You know, it's still positive numbers everywhere here.

So I think what this, uh, tells you, if anything,

is that the intrinsic motivation to go into politics relative

to the material world must be a major trial.

Every political scientist in the Senate force.

That's okay.

All right, so, uh, and then this just shows that

parties seem to screen on unabated.

So, uh, this is about half time, uh, half time.

So, um, let's try and summarise the Swedish politicians as

positively selected by different ability measures.

Uh, more so at higher political power.

They seem to be representative for all socioeconomic groups, and

even social representation doesn't seem to come at a great

cost in terms of lower ability.

So Latin American co-authors insist on calling this an inclusive

meritocracy.

But I am more hesitant about that analogy.

You have to give them some some things.

And then obviously there are there are many ways of

deepening this analysis.

We need to understand about the mechanisms.

We need to understand, uh, you know, where their competence

and representativeness affects policy and if so, how systematically and

we need to compare to other countries, uh, both in

similar and different political systems.

But data, uh, seem to be a different constraints after

after this.

There are other people have been doing similar things.

Uh, so in Finland, you see pretty much the same

pictures as Sweden.

Um, then, uh, as you know, the same, uh, picture

is somewhat different.

And then, uh, uh, people have done work on the

US and the whole has been trying to use census

data to cannot measure everything that we can do in

the Swedish Microdata, but still trying to do a systematic

comparison with, with the whole population.

And um, uh, I think this is the probably the

right way of doing things.

But there is an important data constraint makes it hard

to perform, you know, uh, in those societies.

So maybe you can take 20 minutes and return to

the populations, uh, in Sweden.

Democrats.

What a recognition.

Something today or so.

Was that a condition with some things today?

Because it became like I understand this a long days.

Oh yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

About three elections.

So you needed to put some fresh air in your

mind.

I'm going to go over there and say yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

Oh, actually.

Yes.

Okay.

Okay.

Shopping.

For the future at home is.

Crucial.

Because what you.

Want.

To.

Do.

Hopefully.

There will be some other people.

To.

Do.

What?

Do you call it?

Are you sure you want.

To start it.

Then?

Copy that.

You should.

You should hear.

From the.

Podium.

You should.

Take the.

Special word for this proposal.

What do you do for.

This special.

What?

Could possibly.

We.

Uh, yeah.

So I have a particular interest.

So it was.

It was a special period.

And the other thing is that, um, you know, normally

when we, when we look at.

Events.

You know what changes?

Yeah.

You try to tease out something that is precise enough

to the point.

Um, but so.

So when you get the statistics of 15, when I'm

in the house and because you have huge samples, that's

necessary as well.

Just because the effect sizes.

I think the issue is because everything changes to the

confines.

So that's what you need so you can explore.

How the impulses look for different people.

Who Well, that's the experience of folks in my retirement,

you know?

But, you know, we have a paper which is working

on now, which looks at the economic outcomes for all

of the shock over the pandemic.

And then we're exploiting the pandemic to grow.

Uh, so in it, depending on trade patterns, pre-pandemic trade

patterns, which are, you know, stable to the first order

Brexit UK.

Exactly.

But for us, we didn't.

Um, so then we looked at output forms in, in

firms that are exporting to in the spring of Italy

and Germany.

And the differences are enormous.

So that's a that's a good variation to exploit.

And then the question is okay so different firms are

different.

How do they pass that on to their employees.

In particular which groups bear the brunt of the adjustment.

So we find important social gradients in in in departments

across groups like the Asia.

Region.

And then the question is next question.

Okay.

So that systematic way more exposure by certain groups.

They work for firms that are more heavily.

Or is it the transmission the output shocks or do

they face larger earnings.

You know.

So then the best part.

Yes.

And among.

I guess the historical reasons why you don't.

Yeah.

People don't like it very much.

Okay.

Somewhat over it.

Yeah.

That's interesting.

I want one of the things.

The whole reason is from my experience.

And that's my job, right?

I thought that there were a lot of questions around

that is guided by openness.

So.

Experimentation is Typically I take a little bite sized.

One which we call.

Showgrounds, which is like a job market and basically choose

to accept little cash transfers.

And she finds that how much everything is a causal

estimate.

It doesn't take.

All my expertise.

So.

The same thing with choice of infrastructure.

And technology.

Here at Coco electronics Are we like this before?

Okay.

So, uh, looking for, um, just.

Uh, six years and before that, I.

Was, I would say about 6 p.m..

I was a statistician.

Yeah, I can imagine that.

Yeah.

Intrinsic motivation.

Is that right?

Um.

Experience.

But that would be something I just have to do.

Okay, so this is the, um.

The populist radical, right?

Um, so, um, this is a case study of the

rise of the populist radical right and after the fall

of communism.

This is the most significant political event worldwide in the

last couple of decades.

And, uh, you know, artists or politicians of the populist

radical.

Right.

And then across countries and electoral systems and, uh, yeah,

here, you know, I there's a list here that I

update every now and then where countries where they are

building government.

Uh, radical.

Right.

Um.

Currently in Hungary, in Italy, in the Netherlands.

Uh, exclamation mark.

Uh, Switzerland.

Israel.

Uh, Philippines.

Uh, Turkey.

But then with uh bracket where they have been in

government and I guess it should be a Slovakia.

I did, uh, here as well.

And, uh.

Yeah.

Anyway, so it I think I don't have to convince

you that this is an interesting phenomenon to investigate.

Um, I mean, the if we talk about the populist

radical, right, the, the, the political platforms have to say

the ingredients, they are anti-establishment and they are anti-immigrant and

basically being an establishment for the populist part.

And being an immigrant is the radical.

Right.

Uh, so this is a bit more nuanced than that,

but, uh, roughly speaking.

So now I'm going to show you a case study

of the Sweden Democrats.

That's the Swedish version goes broadly.

That goes back to the actually pretty dark corners of,

uh, For Swedish political history.

There were sort of a very fringe phenomenon in the

1990s, but then entered into politics and the more seriously

into the 2000.

And what I'm going to do is to, uh, take

a step from existing studies and exploit this data to

see which kind of politicians get mobilised into such a

body.

There are literally thousands of papers on who votes for

the radical right.

There's this, uh, German political scientist called time and time,

uh, who keeps a list, uh, of, uh, studies of

the radical right, uh, parties.

And I looked yesterday.

It has 1505 entries, and he doesn't count the economists

who work on this topic only from, uh, political scientist

and political sociologists.

But all of these studies are, you know, who is

supporting the government.

So we thought it was interesting that who becomes a

politician and gets mobilised by this by the radical right.

So that's what our study is about.

Study the individual.

Politicians are not only voters, but we will look at

the connection between voters.

To some degree.

When we investigate that.

We're going to look pretty directly and I think intuitively

into these two components and established in part and the

anti-immigrant part of the of the platforms.

So we're going to match politician traits against this populist

narrative.

I mean, Trump like to say that he represents the

forgotten people, uh, in society.

Uh, and, uh, we're going to look at productive people,

our people at the outskirts of the community, to what

extent they are overrepresented.

And then in the other dimension of the platform, we've

got to also match traits that expose people more to

competition from immigrants, whether that competition is in the labour

market, in the market where your firm works or in

your neighbourhood or in your political circumstance.

So when you're more exposed than if that's intuitively more

fertile ground for getting mobilised to work for the radical

right.

And then finally, we also ask towards the end of

the question, if the party indeed represents some previously underrepresented

group, which we will find that they do, you know.

Does this come at the cost?

Uh, so.

So, uh, early introduction, uh, talked about the background, the

main ideas and the data, and we go to the

politicians and the voters.

And so it just shows I mean, our data ends

with 2014 election.

Uh, as we discussed during the break, we have now

prolonged it to include the two latest election, 2018 and

2022, but we didn't have that many growth.

This is still you see that, you know, this is

uh, in terms of vote share, a small phenomenon.

But then in the 2000 things start to happen.

And then this just shows that Sweden has proposed proportional

representation, the number of seats that they collect at different

levels, uh, sort of follows the Exponential growth.

Um, right, he said.

So we felt we should show that, uh, it is,

since we're going to push this line that, you know,

traits that make you belong to the anti-establishment or outside

establishment are potentially instrumental.

And, uh, you know, uh, being anti-immigrant is instrumental.

Uh, we wanted to show that the Sweden Democrats are

really different than the other parties.

So here we rely on two surveys, and surveys are

not they did fantastically that they did in 2017.

But uh, nevertheless, uh, they are still useful.

Um, so uh, and we did one, um, survey with

all local politicians in Sweden.

Response rate 71%.

So pretty good.

Uh, it's an extensive survey.

And we also got actually permission, the informed consent to

cross this with the with the various registers that we

have.

It's a good source for many things, but but, uh,

they were asked a bunch of questions, including, you know,

how much they trust or distrust the national parliament, which

is one measure of anti-establishment attitudes.

And then we have another, another, um, survey also made

in 2017.

This is one set of political scientists.

This is with another set of Gothenburg political scientist, where

we ask verbatim exactly the same question to representative sample

of the Swedish population.

And we also asked them for the synthetics so we

can sort of couple, uh, then the responses to the

same question among sort of politicians serving all parties and

people that say that they sympathise with those parties.

And here the, the size of the rings, uh, represent

the size of the body.

So these are the Social Democrats, these are the conservatives,

these are the Sweden Democrats.

And here are five other parliamentarian parties.

Um, and uh, as this um, graph would show, uh,

you know, for the Social Democrats, there is, uh, 10%

of the over 5% of the politicians say that they

are, uh, have a lot of distrust or a little

distrust in the, uh, national Parliament.

uh, conservatives is pretty high.

A little bit higher.

But the Sweden Democrats really stand out as being 65%

of the politicians is trusting, and 55 of the voters

is trusting that the National Party.

And if you look at it, you know they're on

the right side, meaning that the politicians have larger distrust

and then the voters, whereas opposite holds for the other

parties.

This is a question from the same two surveys on

whether people think that refugee immigration is a good idea,

or whether it should stop.

Uh, so people who are opposed to immigration, uh, would

say so.

And this is 2017.

So it's after the, uh, the Syrian refugee crisis and

that struck Sweden and Germany particularly hard.

And again, it's a similar picture.

Politicians more activist in the Sweden Democrat than the voters.

And the you know in the again the conservatives in

a little bit in that direction.

But the other part is solidly in the lower left

corner here in two people thinking it's a good idea.

Uh, yes.

We get more years of.

Data for the survey of the politicians.

We are thinking about doing it again because there are

lots of cool things in the in the survey that

actually we collected personality types of the politicians.

Um, the big find and the interesting because economists I

think under appreciate the importance of personalities.

We want to see what is solidly Totally.

Um.

It's good to do it again.

So we're thinking about it, um, in this election anyway.

So there's no question that the Sweden Democrats are in

both of these dimensions.

Uh, you know, the anti-establishment and the anti-immigrant part looks

different than the other polls.

So we're going to use the same kind of sources,

uh, the election authority data on politicians, the details of

socioeconomic information for them and the rest of the population.

And, uh, we also use this individual survey.

So the main idea is tend to to link political

mobilisation or identification to individual level trends.

Um, because we have microdata and we say Ask whether

outsider status drive mobilisation across politicians.

So the idea is, if you are an outsider in

society and will measure outside your ship in, uh, seven

different ways, uh, then you're more likely to think about

the establishment as your outgroup, and you're more likely to

identify with a political message that criticises the establishment.

It's a pretty simple idea, you know, got to be

implemented as well.

So we're going to look at outsider ship in the

labour market as well as in the in the family.

And we're going to look at people who have a

current outside ship or who grow up as in a,

in an outsider household.

And then similarly for the for the anti-immigrant attitudes, we

look at people who are exposed to immigration in their

daily lives.

The idea is then, that you more likely to identify

with a anti-immigration platform.

If you feel the pressure of competition from immigrants, maybe

you're more likely to stereotype about the bad things about

about this immigration competition.

So again, we look at the labour market, uh, social

exposure.

So here is more specifically what we do.

So for outsider status we're going to look at the

number of measures.

So are we going to look at people who have

a loose attachment to the labour market or no attachment

to the labour market.

We call these people labour market outsiders.

So the practical definition is that you have been without

a steady job for at least three years over the

last three years.

Then, among the people who do have a steady job

in that minimal definition, we're going to see how securely

they are attached to that job.

So we're going to look at vulnerable insiders and secure

insiders.

More precisely, we're going to use the word door et

al.

Classification that they used in, you know, how um, and

they in the decision of various occupations into tasks and

people with sort of have a large share of routine

tasks, they are facing a riskier job because they can

more easily be replaced by a robot or rationalised away,

uh, you know, the if not, you can look in

the paper.

This is a the classification into routine tasks, manual tasks,

and sort of intellectual tasks.

And, you know, use that then that, you know, the

routine task, uh, to, to cut the insiders in two

halves.

Then another measure, uh, of uh, of outside the ship

is that you receive social you have received yourself social

welfare and only 5% of uh, Swedes, uh, ever get

social welfare.

So it's a pretty stigmatising experience.

Um, and then we do the same thing for, you

know, when you're growing up, did your father live on

welfare?

Uh, in the beginning of the period for which we

have data.

Uh, what's your father?

Labour market outside in the US and what kind of

upbringing did you have?

And then on the social side.

We separate.

We divide people into those that are living with someone

else or people who are single or divorced.

Uh, so they are outsiders in that sort of, uh,

marriage market or whatever you want to call it, uh,

getting together market.

And, uh, similarly, we look at, uh, at the situation

when you, uh, grew up, uh, where your parents divorced,

uh, when the child was 18 or not.

If they were, that's one classification.

And then for the immigration exposure, you look at employment

competition, fiscal competition and residential competition, uh, it's pretty obvious.

So these are binary measures.

Uh.

you are an outsider or not in a given year.

And your father was a labour market outsider.

Not earlier.

And, uh, once we just do a sanity check and

look at the attitudes, uh, so share of, uh, with

a people with low trust in the parliament.

And she has strongly opposed to immigration, either among politicians

or voters, then the outsiders always have a higher share.

That's true for all these measures.

So this is just to see that there is a

starter for what what we're doing now in the starting

the the other six ideas.

Anyway, let's look at um, this is uh, I think

the, the starkest graph in the, in the in the

paper.

So out of that general population.

35% are labour market outsiders, meaning that they didn't have

a steady job in the last three years among the

parties than traditional parties, not the Sweden Democrats.

That number is 20%.

For the Sweden Democrats, it's almost 50%.

So the difference is 30 percentage points.

So big bracket on two sides of the population.

And so, you know, there seems to be a great

number of outsiders in the labour market sense.

That's hard to dispute, that many may wonder, okay, so

what if we split this into into all the other

parties and we they do that index.

And then, you know, it's a histogram, but they are

hovering around 20%.

That's true also for the for the for the last

for the for the Social Democrats on on the.

Equally uh labour market insiders then conditional on being an

insider.

Uh, we split them, as I said, into two groups,

the vulnerable and the secure insider.

So by definition, population is 50% of each.

Uh, among the traditional parties is only 30% that, uh,

of the politicians that belong in this category, whereas for

the Sweden Democrats it's almost 60%.

So again, a huge difference.

Um, received social welfare again, a 5% or 4% of

the population never did it in the other.

In the conventional parties, almost nobody in Sweden, Democrats, 8%.

Uh, single or divorced.

In the population, 40% 27.

In the traditional parties 53 for the Sweden Democrats.

Father, being an outsider on welfare or divorced again, you

see differences of the same time.

So in every one of these dimensions, Sweden, Democrat politicians

or indeed outsiders, as we have defined the term, then

when you do the immigration exposure, there are differences that

are kind of qualitatively similar, but not so, so it's

dark behind on the outside.

But then you may say, okay, so this was binary

classification, just plotting the data.

Everyone knows that people who are support, at least we

know that from the previous literature that they tend to

be quite, uh, non educated, middle aged man.

So maybe it's all the same things they are.

That goes with being all of those things.

Uh, I told you this binary classification.

So here we hold constant things conventional way.

So we do it in three ways.

So here is for labour market outsiders.

And we measure the proportion in the Sweden Democrats among

Sweden Democrat politicians minus the proportion in other bodies.

So that was something like 27% in the in the

graph that I just showed you.

But now we hold constant municipality election period fixed effects.

That's this one.

Then we hold constant controls for education, age and sex.

So we don't do the, uh, low educated, middle aged

men, so to speak.

And then in the for the third dot, uh, we

hold constant all the other measures that we have here

on the ten other measures.

And, uh, as you see, it's not it's not the

same thing.

And these, um, correlations, uh, tend to persist even though

some of them become a little bit smaller.

They are still stark even when you do the, the

full, uh, correlation matrix.

It is, uh, you know, here is what happens if

we do a machine learning exercise?

So when we do, uh, it's a limited machine learning

because we don't throw all the data at the machine.

We run around the forest where we just include our

11 categories, and we let the, uh, you know, the

unrestricted, uh, the, the random forest estimates how important these,

uh, these features are in explaining the difference between, uh,

or picking out the Sweden Democrat politician or the politician,

and so that the most important is normalise that one

and, uh, the five uppermost, uh, features that, uh, uh,

the random forest picks out are all outsider measures.

Then the other ones are do not fall out, but

they are less important.

And in order not to not to continue the taxonomy

forever.

We decide.

Okay, so let's pick the four top ones and go

with those and see what happens when we study the

rest of the paper.

And we go to the voters section.

So this is what I showed you after now was,

you know, for the country as a whole.

But maybe this was driven by some municipalities that were

particularly conspicuous.

And for the rest, you know, things are not so

starkly different here.

We sort of look at the different municipalities again within

the data.

So it will be easier to to interpret the graphs.

And we show on the x axis for those four

top outsider shaped measures the situation, the variation in the

municipality.

Okay, so in the share of single or divorced municipalities

run from 25% to 46%.

Okay.

And then we draw the, the, uh, share of elected

councillors that are single or divorced for the other parties

than Sweden Democrats.

That's the whole range.

And then for the Sweden Democrats, which are the immigrants.

And here we see that, you know, there is a

a difference between the two.

Before we just had a point.

Now we see that it holds at all levels of

of.

Of the share of single or divorced.

And moreover, uh, as this share of singles expands, the

the share of singles in conventional parties also expands, but

it expands at a lower rate, and the share of

singles of divorced is in the Sweden Democrats.

So in Sweden they respond more to the population composition

of outsiders, and the conclusion is.

That that's not true for the other four features, which

where the lines may be, with the exception of this

or basically parallel.

But in all cases, you know, the white dots are

always below the black line, so prevalent.

And not only, uh, Maybe some documentation.

So let's look at, um, uh, the voters.

Uh, one could do this by by survey.

Um, but, uh, we don't really know.

Uh, you know, uh, people tell who they vote for,

but particularly when the Sweden Democrats, that's a similar if

you do surveys.

But we wanted to do actual laws, but then actual

votes cannot be measured at the individual level.

So it has to be measured at the smallest possible

on the smallest possible level.

Where they exist is the precinct.

So in Sweden, precinct is the target to keep them

at 1200 people, roughly speaking.

So it's going to 1200 people.

Are we going to now instead of looking at the

individual trade on the propensity to to be become an

individual.

As Sweden Democrat politician, we're going to look at the

share of people who have the same traits that we

studied for the politicians on the, uh, uh, share of

the Sweden Democrat vote.

So it's like saying, on average, someone who has the

trait is more likely to vote for the Sweden Democrats.

We should study the the the connection between the vote

share and the share of the people in that precinct.

Who holds that a particular.

And, um, we thought it was most convincing to do

this within municipality.

In other words, we run this correlation analysis conditional on

instability, fixed effects.

So we do away with the municipality mean both in

the Sweden Democrat chair and in the outsiders trade culture.

And it looks like this.

So this graph shows the share of outsiders in the

in the precinct.

Uh, there are many voters.

8000 or such.

Um, but again, these are binned into, into larger units.

And here on the y axis you have the Sweden

Democrat vote share.

And as it should.

This cloud is centred around zero because I've taken out

the municipality mean of the Sweden Democrat vote.

So I'm just looking at deviations from municipality means.

And I'm looking at deviations from municipality means in the

shower alongside.

It's a pretty clear, uh, positive connection.

Here is something else is going on.

I think this is, uh, University city's, uh, many students

who who don't have a steady job, but, uh, yeah,

the bulk of the data wants to trace out an

upward sloping line.

This is the share of vulnerable insiders who, depending on

the occupational composition of the the vote share again.

Pretty convincing.

Positive correlation.

The share of single or divorced, or the share with

parents that were divorced by the age of 18.

And you know, these were the four top ones for

the politicians, seems to be a similar relation for the

voters.

So the kind of people that get engaged to the

Democrat.

Politicians are also the same people who vote for you.

Okay.

So this is all sort of an average cross-sectional analysis.

Does this way of thinking about the world also help

us understand the timing of the Sweden democratic process when

it did happen?

So then you have to think quite more conceptually.

So we have said that, you know, the there is

this gap between insiders and outsiders, and it's that gap

that drives people to to become a politician, but also

to vote for the party.

So then we should look for variation.

Uh, preferably.

Because, uh, the gap, if we want to make something

that is like a causal claim.

So we were looking for, you know, changes, shifts for

this family based on this, but in a sense, that's

very hard to find because family relations don't change very,

very often.

And some of them, like, you know, if you grew

up with a in a household with divorced parents, that's

bygone.

So it's not going to change its historical, historical data.

So during our sample period.

However, on the economic side, there are two conspicuous shifts

in this particular period.

Is the financial crisis 2008 to 2011, which was a

shock to unemployment.

And if we write About the vulnerable inside, they would

bear the brunt of.

Right.

That would widen the gap between between.

Not only did they have risky jobs, they have no

jobs.

If that's true.

And the other thing was that that was a new

government elected in the late fall of 2006.

Right.

Uh, and they went to their electorate platform was to

make work pay.

It was the electric promise.

And the way they were going to make work pay

was to have a, have, uh, an income tax credit

that lowered the tax for those that had steady jobs.

And, you know, this was financed by cuts in the

benefits for those that went on benefits.

So, you know, it was a double whammy, uh, to

the to the labour market outside because they didn't get

the text.

In relative terms, it was a double whammy.

They didn't get the tax cap and they got the

benefit.

So on the on this, these graphs ignore this for

a while.

I show these, uh, these events.

So here you see the financial crisis hits, uh, late

2008.

This is, um, this is the, uh, the unemployment rate

for the security insiders.

Those that were security insiders in 2006.

So nothing happens to their unemployment.

They see that about 4%.

These are the labour market, the vulnerable insiders.

Their employment, unemployment rate goes up and stays up until

the 20th.

So there was this gap in between.

That widened between in terms of unemployment.

Inequality across these two types of issues.

Here is the the.

The centre right government takes power and implements this making

work pay.

And here I've divided things into disposable income.

And uh, and for pre-tax income and post tax and

benefit income.

And you see these two graphs are the sort of

the pre-tax incomes.

And you see this drop there that corresponds to the,

to this, uh, unemployment bulge.

So the so there is uh, something that but that

goes back roughly here, this is the disposable income for

the, for the outsiders.

This is the disposable income for the insiders.

And they grow apart from the beginning of this make

work pay program to the end of this graph by

some 20%.

It was a pretty large gap that open.

Now, so what we, uh, if we were.

Not very thoughtful.

It would be tempting to do a kind of shift

analysis.

So we know at the beginning of each of these

stocks, we know the shares of, uh.

Of outsiders and insider in each municipality.

And we know the share of vulnerable versus security insiders

in each municipality.

So we can take those shares to be predetermined, and

then we can take the shift to be the the

national shift in unemployment rates and the national shifts in,

in, in, in incomes.

So that would be good because at the same time,

you know, it's all this interaction between between the, the

growth and the.

So nobody would believe those solutions.

So we don't insist on this being an ideal, but

we insist on this being a pretty good exogenous shift,

uh, for, for people in a particular municipality.

Okay.

So we're not insisting that we're running, uh, to ISVs,

but we are insisting we are running some exogenous just

shifting in the two and we allow for them to

to have effects on the vote.

Share this with Democrats.

So, uh, when we use the 2006 population shares rather

than the current population, shares of these insider shape, etc.,

I think these are the ones we get to get

the noisier estimates, but still.

Um.

So here is what you get when you run the

the Sweden Democrat votes share on the uh on the.

Income inequality between outsiders and insiders in the places where

there were many, uh, outsiders.

Sweden.

Democrat vote share goes up.

Uh, and the multiplier on that is something like three.

Uh, if you hold constant, um, unemployment inequality because of

the correlation between the unbreakable link two.

And then you repeat the exercise for the for the

Democrat vote.

Once you look at this unemployment, the difference you get

is a marginal estimates.

So it seems that, you know, if you look at

the differential growth of the Democrats across 290 municipalities was

particularly large in places where the insider outsider goes through

a lot, and where the, uh, vulnerable insider versus, uh,

uh, secure insider gaps grew in terms of outcomes, income

or unemployment.

This that interest allowed us to keep this in the

paper For, particularly when we didn't insist on the IV,

we have to convince a couple of the referees that

this was a meaningful exercise.

You can have your own opinions, but at least there's

a strong correlation between the relative growth of the party

and how badly, uh, the authority has to be spared

in these two events that were arguably the most dramatic

events.

Maybe you have common questions on this.

I realised it's a lot to swallow.

Uh, you.

Know.

Notepaper.

You mean or just on this sorry.

Question on the old paper or just on these graphs?

You meant the question.

I have a question about that.

The general.

Okay.

You can ask any questions.

We have times.

What they like to see, like when we take stock.

Then I would ask them.

That's all right.

Anyway, so taking stock.

So how can we.

You know what they can say.

Well, we can interpret it.

Uh, again, no solid proof for this interpretation.

I'll deal with a couple of prospective, uh, uh, alternative

interpretations so we can think about this as a kind

of citizen candidate.

All right.

Sweden.

Sweden.

Democrat.

Politicians over represent.

Groups that seemingly support for that.

So this is, uh, you know, consistent with the citizen

candidate logic.

Certain candidates become, uh, credible candidates to voters because they

look more like.

And then, of course, the presumption then is that the

reason they do it is that politicians can't really call

me, uh, by promising things outright.

Or maybe there is some other thing that makes people

want to have descriptive representation, as the term uh is

sometimes called.

But that's one interpretation.

You know, another interpretation would be that perhaps these Democrat

politicians are just opportunistic politicians that failed in other parties.

And, uh, you know, they saw a new party and

they saw a chance to to be elected and, uh,

fulfil their ambition to become a municipal politician.

So then we look at, you know, because we have

the data, uh, we know whether someone, uh, has represented

another party before or been on the ballot of another

party before and failed to get elected.

And the cross party flows is much smaller between the

other parties and between Democrats than it is across the

traditional.

So that doesn't seem to be a, uh, a good

start to to explain what we see.

But then another thing is swing Democrats.

That's a new party.

So maybe, you know, has to be the case that

new parties engage people that are sort of on the

fringes of politics and maybe on the fringes of society.

Uh, so that that's a possible argument.

Um, of course, it's hard to deal with.

The best we could do, and that's in the appendix

to the paper, is that that we looked at the

other bodies that, uh, became represented, uh, in the national

parliament of Sweden during the same time period for which

we have data.

So that would be the Green Party, the Christian Democrats,

and then another populist party, uh, that was elected in

1991, but, but tossed out in the next election.

And if we look at this party, the other populist

party was representative.

They didn't have, uh, more outsiders than the others for

the Greens and, uh, and the Christian Democrats, they had

more insiders and, uh, parties that existed before their entry.

More specific, um, more specific types of more insights.

So the greens, uh, are, you know, very secure insiders.

They have stable jobs and they often have high education.

And for the Christian Democrats, uh, they are insiders in

that they are less often, uh, divorced or single, and

they, uh, often grew up in a, in a splintered

household.

So it's like once you hear it, it's not surprising,

but it seems to suggest that it's not the going

through this outsider shape is not something that that new

parties necessarily have to go through.

Yeah.

Three observations.

Maybe it's two improvements.

So the final, uh, issue is uh, so what are

we left with here?

We're left with a party that is representing now groups

that have previously Industry for lack of a lack of

representation via the traditional parties.

So.

I can think what I like about the policy of

the that is promoted by this party, but it seems

to be a step forward in offering representation to to

certain groups.

The question is whether that comes at the cost for

the people who vote for them.

So here we try to look at the balance of

Sweden, Democrat politicians versus other party politicians in a number

of dimensions, where we try to think of things that

most voters would appreciate about a particular local party.

So do the do the politicians that represent the party

have public sector experience, as you saw, the major tasks

of the municipalities to provide public sector, uh goods.

Uh, to what extent do they have political experience?

Uh, what's the years of education?

What's the earning score we have from the also some

other dimensions we have.

From the survey that I mentioned, we have some collected

peristyle public service motivation.

Supposedly, if you're motivated to enhance public service, then you're

a good representative in the local authority as opposed to

delivering public services.

And here we have a morality question.

But we also posed to the politicians.

It's a from the so-called hexagon module that social psychologists

use in order to gauge the morality.

Uh, for some morality people.

So it's questions like, you know, uh, would you use

counterfeit money if you, uh, knew that you could, uh,

get away with it if you thought it would benefit

your career, would you flatter, uh, someone in a superior

position, things like that.

Um, so for each of these features, we look at

the difference in standard deviations between the three level capitalisations

and, uh, out of the box.

And then.

Uh, the black dots are when we hold constant municipality

election period, fixed effects.

The next shade of grey is where we, uh, control

for education, age and sex.

And the last one is where you control for all

the groups in the analysis of politicians.

And despite these controls, there is a negative difference between

the, uh, Freedom Democrats and the other party politicians in

in all these dimensions.

It's not significant.

The last morality difference, uh, for the rest day or.

Another way to to phrase the same question is to

ask, you know, as in the previous we talked about

the paper that we talked about before the break.

Now, these are, uh, the politicians and of course, the

other party politicians are positively selected.

We already know that from the results that you saw

before the break.

But the Sweden Democrat politician, if anything are negative in

terms of weight.

So.

Weight the you know, the increased representation against the lower

or lower suitability for the media with that thought.

And then the final remark discussed if you like, is

to sum up.

So we study a populist party with populist radical right

politicians and their voters.

It seems that the Sweden Democrats over represent economic and

social outsiders.

So I argue, I can see that as a citizen

candidate movement and perhaps widening outsider insider gaps may trigger

political identification with populist radical right values.

There was the overtime analysis.

So there are different aspects of political selection, you know.

Of course, I've studied this political science to some degree,

but also others, like philosophers have talked about, uh, uh,

selection.

They come up in these most famous, wonderfully written books

about, uh, political selection.

And she separates different types of political selection.

So one is she calls descriptive representation.

And that's like citizen candidate representation.

People like, people like that looks like them to be

represented.

Um, so here these politically we get descriptive representation.

But then with politicians with lower violence.

But then she also talks about another type of representation,

which is substantive representation.

To what degree?

To politicians, uh, managed to achieve benefits for the groups

that they allegedly represent.

And uh, uh, there the jury supposedly came out because,

you know, Sweden Democrats have written they are nothing in

national government.

They're written a 72 page contract with the centre right

about a program that to be implemented in this electoral

period.

So they're not in government, but they're starting to get

in government in several municipalities where they are formally part

of the coalition.

So give us, uh, six more years and then we

can look at the question, what happens in girls in

society?

So yes, as always, it's, you know, you need data

to answer, uh, rather than a priori refuse to answer

these questions.

So that's the end of the Democratic for this.

Now, you had your general question.

Uh, I mean, these are also questions that, as economists

maybe we cannot answer to.

But I was wondering, like in, in this kind of

paper explaining the rise of radical right, what are the

ones about the internet, for example, like the 3G, the

paper by email and the working paper by the centre

building?

But I was wondering what what is the actual mechanism?

What is it about outsider and vulnerable insiders that, um,

shifts them from pro redistribution leftist parties to, uh, right.

Radical right parties.

And yes, I said there's been no, um, there's been

a lot of work on morality, moral values, communities and

so on.

But I don't know.

Um, I think there's something even more deeper than that.

And maybe it's just about, uh, fear and heightened sense

of anxiety and threat that, of course, right wing politician

managed to leverage in some way.

No, I mean, there are lots of things have been

written about about this.

And, you know, some of it is very assertive and

some of it is, um, some of it is more

convincing, I think among the, the descriptive stuff.

Um, what you said about fear, you know, perhaps clearest

articulated by the panellists, uh, has written quite a bit

about this with the art.

Was that sorry?

Englehart yeah, we think it's hard to create the World

Value survey.

So they have their book from 2018 or whatever, 70

perhaps, which somehow claims that there were always some latent

supporters of, uh, of a populist party.

They thought that modernisation has gone too far.

Political modernisation has gone too far.

People just talk about gay marriage and, uh, questions that

don't do not really concern them.

It's, uh, somehow relative of this argument.

It's an educated elite to play their own game.

They don't understand the forgotten people.

But then their argument is this is not enough.

This is the latency to the to to groups like

that, but it's only when they face a sort of

significant uncertainty about their life and their incomes.

When they turn from from latent support to actual values.

In a sense, that's, uh, a version of that is

what what we do in this, looking at those major

events which make the gap between those forgotten groups and,

uh, and, uh, well-to-do in society larger.

And we see that the, you know, the support of

the forces that are growing the larger right, whether those

shifts are bigger.

So it's it's a version of that argument or the

conducted with microdata rather than, you know, you know, the

survey data that they, that The basis.

Not necessarily one is better than the other, but it

is a similar argument.

And it's, um, that it's, uh, as you said, there

is this notion about polarisation in general and the social

media in particular.

Um, it's a it's an interesting literature.

Um.

My problem with that literature, if I have one, is

that it's not always clear whether you believe that, uh,

you know, the social media or the driver or whether

they are just the magnifier or something else that is

going on.

And one can have the view that the, you know,

there's something else that is going on, such as the

kind of shifts we've been talking about, fundamental shifts in

society.

And then, you know, because people are on social media

and getting news that way, then the effects of those

get magnified because there are stereotypes in the social media.

People take more, get more impressed by them in that

way.

But, uh, I think the jury is out and there

are some some nice papers.

Uh, I don't think they pose the the question as

ruthlessly as you did.

You know what is really driving this movement?

And it's such a complex phenomenon.

Now, about social media.

I was thinking about a bit of like I said,

social media are crowding out maybe actual interaction, human interaction,

and along with other things, of course, but maybe this

persistent feeling of social isolation.

Maybe.

But this is something that we cannot measure as economists.

But for now, maybe for now, maybe some more, some

years.

Technical developments are going very to see that.

Maybe some I think.

Yeah.

African commission human interaction with when mobile phones are close

to each other.

Yeah.

So yeah.

So you know this is this lecture I realise is

self-serving.

And I talk about this because I know it better

than that.

Uh, the research, uh, and it's not an attempt to

be be encompassing in trying to think about or prospective

drivers behind the theoretical right.

It's more there to illustrate that, you know, this, this

field of political selection, which is an interesting field.

But in order to make progress believable, progress on it,

you know, microdata is, to me almost a necessity.

Uh, and, uh, that's why I'm talking about.

Because I think it's exhausted, you know?

Yeah.

Is there anything in your data.

That is relate to this kind of like Trump, that

you have a person who's reached but is trying to

move like this, kind of like this and this because

it seems like from the data you have, like people

that come from the backgrounds, like poor backgrounds are supporting

people.

So is there something like that like.

Yeah.

No, I think it's another.

Yeah.

So, so the US and to some degree the UK

or are.

Or I mean countries on majoritarian systems are, you know,

genuinely different than countries that have proportional system.

So in, in in many European countries can enter it

can earn 20% of the vote.

And you know, if they are very successful, you know

the first prize, whatever they uh, they just earn 29%

in the, in the Austrian world.

And, uh, yeah, in Hungary things are different.

But uh, um, but most that's the kind of top

of what's the what these radical right parties get in,

in, in VR, in presidential elections in the US with

all the.

Yeah, you basically have to get at least half the

people in half the states.

Um, and uh, so at least in some places, you

need to create the broader coalition, 20%, 25 is not

going to be enough.

So then, you know, there is something different about Trump

in politics and European radical right politics, because, you know,

he has to build a coalition that is an unholy

alliance of people who are on the shadowlands of society

and some very establishment Republicans, including in terms of garnering

housewife votes.

Nothing wrong, but it's an unholy alliance of Make America

Great Again is somehow, you know, uh, a slogan that

can be interpreted by different groups in different ways.

And, uh, that's this makes it somewhat different.

So he has to appeal to, in an ambiguous way,

to many groups at the same time, although it's hard

to understand why those more traditional voters would listen to

his message, because.

That's not the scientific state.

Okay.

Every five minutes.

If you want to talk about the Covid stuff or

something.

Yeah.

Yeah, well, I've already.

Uh, published something in class.

Uh.

Inequality.

Consequence.

Uh, in the previous.

Book.

Really?

I'm not sure that you do, but, uh, it's, uh.

Also creating much larger.

data sets that people have been using in the past

is so, so challenging.

The.

Kind of equilibrium.

We would like to work.

Yeah.

It'd be amazing to see.

What happens.

Yeah.

So there are there.

Obviously there have been.

There was a huge population bulge in just around the

planet right now, which would probably lower them now that

anything that most people care about.

I think the, the, the jury's still out on the,

on the long run consequences of the pandemic.

Yeah, probably they are going to show.

Having shifted work.

Habits.

Uh uh.

Homeschooling seems to be more important in the UK than

was probably the way that there's a generation of, uh,

students that can get the same kind of socialisation as

others.

You get less likely to follow those schools across that

way.

Yeah.

It's not.

Yeah.

We haven't we haven't seen in those effects to me

that in terms of crisis management.

Yeah.

But uh.

Same actually on the medical side as on the social

and economics, you know, the importance to have real time

data to be able to follow the.

Over what's going on.

Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah.

What is very interesting.

Right.

So a lot of it was done by guesswork or

by, you know, looking at things like hospitalisations or, or

even deaths.

But then you were three, 3 to 4, four weeks

too late if you're using that to gauge the spread

of the pandemic.

So yeah, that's that's a that's an infinity in pandemic.

And the UK recent Covid infection survey is a randomised

and selected.

So so how how did that work.

So streets were selected for one thing and then really

close some things.

And when did that stop.

That's down to and.

I Think June 2020.

So before the second word, yeah.

It was out by the.

End of this year.

And that was great.

That was something.

Yeah.

And how large were the summer?

It was worth it to have full geographic coverage and

also trace the region.

And the amount of days and hours.

And is it available?

Exposed?

Well, it should be.

I think if you made a request in the series,

it is not already.

Too much.

It's just a question of how data.

The question is whether one can connect it to something

useful like this.

Yeah, there were some gigantic.

There is this paper in this paper in someone medical

journal, the journal of uh uh, um, I don't remember

which one, but which which is very cool looking at

the, the, the effect of, uh, vaccinations, um, using the

age limit of AP, uh, for the first three weeks,

uh, and then doing an order around that on the,

uh, it's, um, you know, I have the the reference.

I don't remember the first dose, but.

We are trying to do some we have the, the

complete roll out of, of, uh, the Swedish vaccination because

it's sort of one of the most shocking things about

the.

Lecture 5:

This is.

I don't want to have to write a column.

And workshop conference.

But don't come during the conference.

Yeah.

Hey.

Okay, so maybe we'll get going.

Um, whatever comes later will suffer from, uh, delay.

Oh.

I seem to be suffering from normal responding.

Okay.

Very good.

So, um, last week we started to talk about, um,

microdata in under using analysing Swedish politics.

Uh, and um, uh, we discussed this broad question on

who becomes a politician.

And uh, and on balance there are signs of, perhaps

surprisingly, to some meritocratic selection in the sense that on

average, politicians are more able than the population at large,

and they come from diverse social backgrounds.

So, um, furthermore, ability seems to rise with the political

power Our politicians had we climbed the ladder from nominated

to elected local politicians, then to mayors and then parliamentarians,

and then political parties in the in the system seem

to play an important role in screening.

We also looked particularly on the Sweden Democrats radical right

party, and found that outsider groups were overrepresented, uh, among

their politicians as well as among their voters.

Arguably, that was one reason why the party group.

We hope, uh, that will happen on Tuesday, but, uh,

it's, uh, I'm revealing my stance in the US election

anyway.

So in this week's lecture, um, I'm going to show

you examples of how to analyse additional drivers of local

leadership.

in particular whether other criteria than ability, in particular popularity

among voters, uh, which is sort of measured by the

number of preference votes that politicians gather.

I'll explain exactly what that means in a minute.

That seems to play a key role in the appointment

of, uh, local party leaders.

And then we look at the behaviour, uh, local leaders,

how they pick, uh, or exert their influence on who

else is going to be on the party ballot.

And in particular, we're going to look at the effects

of gender quotas in, in politics.

And you can think about this as investigating whether, uh,

more equal gender representation will come with an ability cost

or not.

So this, Uh primary effect paper again co-author Sola.

And, uh, it's published in a political science journal.

Uh, one of my few publications in such such venues.

Uh, anyway, it's broadly on a broader, uh, um, view.

It's about accountability.

The and uh, uh, and elections.

Uh, so we have been discussing in, you know, in

the theory discussing how competition can help voters, uh, uh,

get a better outcome sometimes.

But then we speaking about competition between political parties.

But of course, there's also some competition within parties.

Uh, about, uh, you know, who is going to be

the, the leading politician.

And, you know, one can I guess one can debate

whether primary elections in a system such as the US

one for president, uh, promotes efficiency or not, but it

has this competitive mechanism within parties to, you know, um,

pick out, uh, candidates that are going to be on

the single ballot.

Uh, that means our Italian systems typically have both at

the national level, as in the presidential election, but also

in each constituency, uh, say in the US, you know,

each one of those legislate, uh, elections to the Congress

is preceded by a set of primaries.

Proportional representation, where there are party ballots, is often sought

by political scientists to promote representation at the expense of

accountability.

And.

Uh.

It's important to think about the AR as well, because

half of all democracies, uh, who elect.

Leaders broadly and, uh, have some such system.

And I can say there's very little work within party

competition and, uh, accountability or, or representation in proportional representation.

So that's especially true for those, um, proportional representation system

that operate with closed lists rather than open.

So it probably don't know those terms, but closed lists

is is a, you know, voters are presented by a

ranked list that the leadership of the party has made

up, and people get elected Depending on how many seats

the party gets is proportional.

The votes in the order that, uh, you know, has

been made up on this close list.

Some proportional representation systems, including Finland, uh, including Brazil, have

instead an open list where candidates will be presented in

alphabetical order in some neutral fashion.

Uh, and in fact, the people who get the most

votes from the voters, uh, decide who will be representing

the party in the legislature.

So still proportional.

You get 20% of the vote, you get 20% of

the seats.

But the people who get elected are those that are

sort of most popular in those openings.

Now.

Preference voting is an attempt to introduce a kind of

open list, uh, principle in closed list PR.

So in particular, I'll show you exactly how this works

in in effect.

Um, but the notion is that if you're not enough

voters pick a specific candidate, they then they can be

parachuted to the top of the list.

Answers suspend any party ranking that has been made.

And, uh, more than ten countries have pursued such a

reform in the post-war period.

However, um, this is, uh, commonly seen as a failure,

uh, to the extent there are researchers that are written

about these reforms, uh, they see it as a failure.

The reformers themselves see it as a failure.

And the people like multimillionaire, he's a hero in in

more descriptive, political science I've described has described this as

a failure.

Uh, and the reason they think it's a failure is

that there are a few new politicians that are elected.

Uh, in fact, both these preference votes have to be

concentrated at the top of the list.

Uh, so doesn't make much of a difference.

So these guys are thinking about it as a reform

to change representation, and voters can, uh, others represent them

in the party?

Uh, whereas our investigation is more about accountability.

Uh, and, uh, let's see, it will be about, um,

leadership.

So what we do is that we propose and I

written confirm, I guess faithful to proper I should say,

does not reject, uh, uh, a particular hypothesis, namely that

the preference both may have a kind of a primary

effect.

In other words, it can work as a primary election

for the for the party leadership.

So people will do well in the preference vote, have

a higher chance of becoming the party leader.

Therefore, it works kind of like a primary election in

the in in in the party.

Uh, and uh, we're going to test that by looking

at the within party distribution of uh, preference votes in

municipal elections.

So I will give you a form of this.

Um, it's a little bit tricky to do so because

that would some voters understand what's going on then.

You know, it's a tricky problem of strategic voting Well,

what you do at one stage, uh, sort of affect,

um, um, uh, outcomes in a later game.

So this is this is a hard problem.

I'm sure it's how relevant it is.

It requires quite smart voters.

But you know that Thomas Piketty became a hero of

of income distribution studies, was a political economist.

In fact, he was hired by MIT when he was

22, uh, as a political economist.

And then he was working on things like, you know,

why is it that opinion polls often come out quite

evenly?

And it is because voters are trying to send a

signal to parties that, you know, and perhaps not doing

the right thing.

Ronnie Rosin, chairman of the econ department here and nowadays,

uh, since this had in his thesis, uh, some work

on this And there are some other papers on this.

So I'm not going to give you that.

But I'm going to give that, uh, we can still

learn something from reasonably.

Careful empirical studies.

And one reason why the primary effect.

Hypothesis is might be interesting to investigate, is that party

leaders are very important in PR systems.

And the the literature is sort of, um, uh, clear

place.

Party leaders are major draw draws.

Uh, of course they occupy position.

They are sort of instrumental in determining policy, particularly when

a party party part of a coalition, so that one

has to bargain about what's going to happen.

And, uh, in the formation of coalitions for the leaders

are also basically the negotiation.

So who it is may not get.

So, um, okay, so what I'm trying to show you

is give some background, um, state some predictions, uh, shall

we our empirical strategy and the results and then conclude

so like voting or some form that have been discussed

for a long time, actually many, many, um, places that

had restrictions on the franchise, uh, in the 19th century

when they introduced mass voting, allowed, uh, um, many people

to vote.

Uh, a number of countries went from a plurality system

to a PR system, and this was criticised as giving

too much power to the parties.

And they have been a constant debate about, you know,

how much power parties should have relative to the voters.

Uh, so already in 1909, people said, we need to

restrict the power of parties and be involved is more,

more, more.

Say the reform was only introduced 90 years later.

So it took a while.

But anyway, it happened.

And, um, the people had, you know, one preference vote.

Each person has one preference so that they can use

that but must not use.

And if someone gets a lot of, uh, preference votes,

they get, uh, parachuted to the top of the list.

Uh, if they pass 50 votes As a minimum absolute

and 5% of the party's votes.

So here is how it works.

So this is a Swedish ballot.

It's from the municipality of Waldemar, from the east coast,

200km south of Stockholm.

Uh, it belongs to the municipal council.

This is the Conservative Party.

Uh, running these candidates.

And before the preference votes, there were no boxes on

these, uh, on the left hand side here.

So then with a closed list, it would just have

been an order from one downwards.

Uh, of people I'm here on top is showing some,

uh.

Then it's voluntary what you put on the ballot.

Here they say that he's a farmer and he lives

in one village in this municipality.

Okay, next one is under Neilson.

She's a legitimised nurse and she also has a filmography.

That's a university degree.

And she lives in great.

Some some parties also put the age of the of

the candidates on the ballot, but it goes on like

that.

So if this if this were a, uh, a close

ballot, then, you know, the party would get the number

of candidates that their vote share dictates.

So the conservatives typically get 20% of the vote or

such.

Uh, so, uh, 20%, uh, I think well, my speak

has 31 people in their council, so that would mean

something like six, uh, uh, people that, uh, get elected

for 20%.

So the last person to get elected would be he's

a farmer and an accounting Consultant in Europe.

Now, this is an open list.

It's one of the first elections with an openness.

So now we have these boxes so people can put

tickets for particular candidates and get that get many, many

takes can, uh, you know, be moved up.

So let's take an example.

Take shallow knowledge.

Actually Holland is a very uncommon name.

So in all likelihood she lives in the same place

as uh, as patronage.

It's, uh, uh, father and daughter or hospital life, probably

the latter.

So she said agronomist and the broker's assistant as well.

And she's very popular.

Let's hypothesise.

So she gets, you know, more than 50 takes and

she get more than 5% of the party's votes.

So then she moves up to the top, or she

gets elected and she knocks out her husband.

Uh, from, uh, from getting elected.

Uh, hope the family survives this, uh, this intrigue.

So that's, uh, uh, kind of works.

On this threshold.

However, as I said, this system is often viewed as

a failure because, according to the argument, many of these

votes are wasted.

So people don't often vote for people in the eighth

place.

They vote for people who are on the top of

the list and would have gotten elected anyway.

So in fact, only 5% to the threshold would have

needed it to get elected.

They would have gotten elected by the order.

How many things can you put?

How many?

Can you put.

More than one?

I just want you.

Don't have to.

You can only put one.

Okay.

So this is one sense in which it is, um,

not a success or failure.

The other is that there's low participation, so only about

30% of votes to voters would cast preference votes.

Um, and when, you know, you look at surveys and

ask people, did you cast the preferences vote?

If not, why?

They may look like other voters, except, uh, that if

they cast a preference vote, they know a little bit

more about politics and have a stronger party identification.

So, um, they care more about the party, so to

speak.

Um, but, um, so let me show you the is.

This is the on average the the preference votes that

go across parties and across elections.

This is the person who's on the ballot that gets

something like 30 to 35% of all preference votes.

And then as people are on lower points of the

ballot, they get lower.

So of course, there are occasional people who fall down

that get that that doesn't affect the average, but the

general tendency is clear.

And also in small party groups it's even more concentrated.

If you look at, uh, across municipalities, uh, on average,

30% cast a ballot.

These are municipality.

Um, by election.

Uh participation rates expressed as a density.

So you see, it's about 30% on average.

And it's kind of skewed to the, uh, to the

left.

I guess there's more mass here.

But then there are there are a few municipalities where

there are many situations.

And we saw this graph, uh, when we started working

on this project.

We didn't know where exactly where we were going.

We were kind of curious because in the few elections,

there are 90% of the people are taxed at practice.

So then we started looking and we found that it's

all in the municipality of our colleagues, which you would

know where it is.

It's by Torna, uh, River, which is the boundary between

Sweden and Finland in the north, and so is a

municipality with the Social Democrats every time.

And it turns out that apparently they have that stated

that the party leader would be picked as the person

who got the most preference votes, given that they were

winning anyway over.

Aha!

That's how we do this.

The idea for.

The paper.

Was was conceived.

Evidently some parties do this is this, you know, does

it have this way of looking at it?

Does it have general traction?

So anecdotally, preference votes do matter.

You you should remember that municipal elections are kind of

a low information environment.

Uh, yes.

They are occasionally opinion polls, uh, and the opinion polls,

uh, would then be run at the level of the

party and mostly in the bigger municipalities.

Uh, so, um, we talked to some politicians about how

they view this stuff, about preference for some of the

leading Social Democrats.

He didn't want his name to be mentioned.

Don't mention his name is happens to have been a

minister.

Um, but I won't say more.

Uh, they said literally, we would be stupid to ignore

such information about candidates when we think about how to

promote that.

And the other thing is that, you know, to the

extent that our local media, they tend to report on

preference voting, that's typical media reporting.

You know who got the most preference votes and what

happens to that same person in the in the aftermath

of the election.

Moreover, there are some spectacular examples of successful politicians who

get a lot of preference votes.

So this guy, he was a local phenomenon.

He he was a, uh, member of the former Communist

Party, then the party in Sweden, in the municipality, old

one company town in the middle of the country.

And normally this party runs at between 5 and 10%.

On a good day in August, they had 55% of

the local vote, and this guy had 95%, uh, preference

vote.

Um share.

So it kind of illustrates the the tonight.

The problem is it that, you know, uh, this guy

gets many preference votes because, uh, he's a good guy.

Or is he?

You know, he becomes a good guy because he gets

many preference votes.

It's hard to know.

Or maybe there's some limited variable, uh, very good ability

in politics.

Likely explanation.

So.

So thinking about this connection between, you know, the number

of preference votes, uh, and people's popularity is sort of

a hazardous issue.

So then, uh, we have to have this was something

which was surprising from from from the absurd.

They told us you must take your hypothesis clearly.

And we understand this.

What you're doing about, uh, about the main hypothesis.

But there must be other hypotheses.

Also, can you please state them and check them or

whether they are, uh, not so.

So we have we have three predictions in the paper

that are sort of confronting with the data.

So the first one is that the one that is

primary idea preference voters gives direct information on candidate popularity.

And this is used in appointments for local party leader

or to mayor.

To the extent the party has the opportunity of appointing

the mayor.

And then is that, you know, winning the preference vote

in the sense of getting the most of them may

be a focal event.

And then that's the parallel to winning the primary election

in a in a plurality system.

So this is one.

Individuals who obtain the most preference votes have a greater

probability of future political promotion.

Prediction two is about somehow heterogeneity in that effect.

Uh, and uh, that is that parties will pay attention

to voter popularity, particularly when it.

When it concerns candidates that are vetted, uh, by the

by the party, you know, in primary elections again to

draw the parallel with that system are different in the

US, it's pretty much open entry into a primary election.

But in some countries in Latin America, you know, provide

voters with, uh, with a number of, uh, of candidates

who then form up the primary election.

And, uh, one would guess that these are the days

that the party would trust.

Uh, so we're going to look at that.

And then, of course, there are trade offs in promotion.

This is a measure of voter popularity.

But we have just seen that, uh, ability seems to

be important in, in the system.

So, you know, any sort of information oriented theory would

tell you that, you know, popular information on popularity is

most important, other things equal.

So in other words, it would matter the most for

people with similar abilities.

Since we can measure ability of politicians, as you saw

last week.

Okay.

Check that out.

So that's the second that the hypothesis is based on

individual heterogeneity.

And then there is uh one prediction.

You are encouraged to do check on the political context.

And here, you know.

Is that, uh, two forces that made part is, uh,

make us expect a stronger primary effect.

One is electoral competition.

So when the parties are neck and neck, They are

more sensitive to the voters wishes.

And another one is this social democracy and the colleagues

effect.

If you're in the majority and you know you're going

to appoint a leader, then perhaps you pay more attention

to the voters, because otherwise there might be a backlash.

Then if you're in the minority.

So your appointments are not that important.

Okay.

So how do we do this?

Uh, well, you've probably already figured out that we'll use

a regression discontinuity design.

So we're going to look at, um, at, uh.

Within party distributions of preference votes where the two top

candidates are basically neck and neck and, uh, unless there's

systematic differences, then it's basically a lottery.

Which one wins that tight race in the in the

preference mode.

So then we can estimate more like a causal effect

of uh, of winning the, the preference mode.

So we're going to have a specification that includes both

the winner and the first runner up within each party.

Uh, so that's since we can use, you know, all

elections from 1998.

We are this data that we used for this paper

go to 2014.

So that's five election.

And then we have 290 municipalities.

And then we have about 8 or 9 parties in

each municipality.

So if you carry out that multiplication it comes to

something like 20,500 races.

Uh, so there's hope that, uh, I can have some

power to identify something, uh, closely.

So when we run the, uh, RDD, then we in

order to get the a forcing variable that behaves plausibly.

So we will in each election each year, each party

in each principality will measure the win loss margin between

the top two candidates.

And then we're going to divide by their total vote

to get the relative winning margin.

So, uh, that we ran from impasse Zero and we

would sort of look at the the outcomes close to

zero.

Okay.

So what is it that we use as an outcome

variable.

We would like to measure who is the local party

leader?

I hope you don't have that.

Uh, you know, that's not noted in the in the,

in, in, in the data that we have, except that

we suspect that, you know, whoever shows up as the

local party leader.

Uh, in, uh, t plus one, uh, is a proxy

by the top name.

Sorry.

The local party leader who has served in an electoral

period, will typically be on top of the party's list

in the next election.

Um, for 2006 and 2010, we have data, uh, with

a survey of local party leaders so we can check

this, this proxy and, uh, uh, at least we know

who is the mayor and who is the vice mayor

in each candidate?

And that's the sort of consistent with this proxy in

nine out of ten cases and eight out of ten

cases for vice mayor.

And the exceptions are people who are 70 or so.

So most likely retiring for for at least.

Uh, but uh, alternatively, we can also use data from

these two elections about these powerful positions directly as the

outcome variable.

And we had we're losing some power because there's only

two elections.

So only one party or points, but another party, the

vice mayor.

Okay.

So we impose some sample restrictions so they're not very

important.

Um, anyway, and uh, let's now look at, uh, the.

quad graphs.

Um, so this is this margin to this victory.

So, you know, um, winners are to the right of

zero.

Losers are to the to the left of zero.

Now, this is, uh, 12,500 observations, as I said.

So we need to be in them.

But then, you know, when people draw these plots, they

they, you know, you can always choose a plot favourably,

even wind plot.

So here I'm showing two, two ways of doing it.

This one, uh, you know, you take an equal number

of points in each behind each bin.

That's one way of doing it.

Uh, I think it's 50 behind each bin.

Such.

But this one, we have equal distances instead, So you

know it's two percentage points and take all the observations

within that percentage.

And this is not obviously not the same thing.

Uh, because there is a distribution of uh, of outcomes

along these, uh, this axis.

Nevertheless, the uh, sort of suggested the annuity is kind

of similar in these two illustrations, and it's on the

order of 15 percentage points, and the base rate is

25, which would mean literally that, you know, winning the

preference not increases your chance of becoming the leader by

60%, which.

By.

Any means is a sort of effect of what you

kind of take, not the, you know, it's, uh, you

know, this is the illustration.

I should be careful.

And nowadays the industry standard says never use polynomials, use,

you know, control functions that are linear.

So, um.

Let me show you some regression results instead.

In the paper we have a number of specifications.

In in the table I'm going to show and go

on and look at the OLS.

Just for comparison we're going to look at the second

order polynomial.

I want to look at uh uh local linear control

functions.

Um I'm going to look at uh, um, different bandwidths.

At the time we wrote this, the industry standard was

by inverse and now it's canonical et al.

So anyway, we used that optimal bandwidth.

They also show you 10%.

And then we also show results where we don't join

in control functions.

All.

We just have a very narrow window and compare outcomes

below and above zero.

So 5%.

So now here is the what's.

So it estimates a 25 percentage point difference of uh

crossing zero.

But then when we introduce reasonable controls that uh estimate

is hopelessly unstable, it drops down to 2020 percentage points

or in half.

So this doesn't look very trustworthy.

Instead, the various estimates, uh, are much more stable to

the inclusion of, uh, of these control variables.

And, uh, you know, this is around 15.

This is just above ten.

This is around, uh, 20.

Whichever of the of the assets we knew.

So that seems more more stable and more plausible.

We also, um.

Do, uh, a graphic illustration.

I think this is useful when one does, uh, the

analysis to kind of illustrate the, the trade off in

the estimation.

Basically we are trading off is nest against precision.

So when we close to the to the we hopefully

get an unbiased estimate.

But we have a small number of observations.

So we get a sort of a volatile estimate.

And as we increase the bandwidth you know we may

suffer from bias.

But on the other hand And, uh, we get something

more precise.

And this optimality criterion, uh, whether it's a Ramanan or

I don't know, that tries with imbalances trying to balance

those two, uh, against each other.

And here, you see, we have the local linear specification

in the beginning when we have very low bandwidths, uh,

then, you know, the estimate is all over the place.

But after a while, it kind of stabilises and then

it drifts down.

And the standard errors this is the 95% confidence band,

uh, kind of shrinks, uh, as we go, go further

up.

And the close margin specification high without the control function

kind of looks, uh, similar, at least qualitatively.

Um.

And sort of stabilise it, maybe at the bias level,

but on the order of 15%.

And um, if we instead now look at those Mer

positions, instead of using the proxy of being at the

top of the list in the next election, uh, we

have fewer data points.

So now each dot is something like ten.

Each brain is like activations, uh, and we get a

bit noisier estimates.

But it seems that if anything the, the, the estimates

to this, this is the, you know, being the council

board chair, this is being, uh, uh, having a full

time salary.

You remember that these local politicians are mostly lesser politicians,

but, those two typically who have the full time salary.

Um, if you look at those appointments and the parties

who appointed them, you know, now you get an increase

from 30 percentage points to 60, uh, for both these,

uh, which is a doubling of the problem.

If you win in this primary preference.

You.

Can do other tasks one wants, you know, the McCrory

test checks that there is no bundling.

So nothing fishy is going on on the two sides

of zero.

One can do placebo tests, uh, on some outcomes that

would be predetermined and therefore shouldn't be affected.

Uh, that's disgusting the paper.

Uh, another, uh, test that I like is to use

a kind of placebo threshold.

So pretend that the threshold for winning is at -5%

plus 5%, uh, rather than zero.

And estimate under that assumption here, we have done that

for, for, you know, different threshold values.

So we plot the, the point estimates with the solid

curve and the confidence intervals with the, with the dash

curve.

And by and large, the only significant estimates uh, are

at zero also at a higher number.

And the same is true if we do the cross

markets.

So again sort of increases the confidence in what we

were doing.

And we have these, um, auxiliary.

Predictions that we were encouraged to do.

So you remember, uh, one was, uh, you know, about

the androgynous person characteristics, and the other ones might be

some context.

So the active versus non-elected candidates is hard to do.

Exactly.

Know exactly what to do.

Suppose we interpret that candidate as being someone that has

put in one of the first three positions, rather than

further down on the list, where you see an effect

for those, you don't see an effect outside of the

current top three, but not so many observations here, so

it's hard to know Anyway, it's not being consistent with

that idea.

Um, the other thing was this, you know what?

The information does populate the brain.

Uh, I said we can we can look at various

situations.

We can look at situations where where the top two

candidates who had the major race or both competent, uh,

have above median competence, measured by the, um, by the

earning score that you remember from, from the from last

week or both are mediocre, meaning that they are both

below the median confidence, uh, within the party or, uh,

they are of mixed competence.

One is is competent, the other one is not.

Um, and the fact that you see, Uh.

Ah.

You know, consistent with the, with the main result, when

either both have low competence or both have high competence.

But when there is mixed competence, there isn't a major

effect.

So there are other criteria on which to base the

appointment.

We would argue it's not inconsistent.

Right.

And then uh.

One can look at the political context, at least for

the for the most of the time where we do

this estimation, which politics follows the kind of centre versus

centre left bloc even though it has eight bodies.

So we can classify the degree of competition by the

differences in the past last election above or below the

median level of competition.

And this, you know, whether a party belongs to the

majority or whether a party in which a winner belongs

to the minority.

And so there are combinations then, uh, I competition between

the blocks and winning in a majority party, high competition

between the blocs, winning in the minority party, no competition

between the blocks, but winning in the majority party and

low competition between blocs and winning in the minority party.

In this case, you don't see.

And in fact, in the other ones you do, when

you either have high competition or it's a majority party.

So we were happy when we sent in the picture.

We had these, these results.

But then there was a referee who didn't really was.

Uh.

Uh, pretty harsh.

So he said, give me another example.

Uh, this is Sweden.

Maybe Sweden is uh, is very different.

So then we have to come up with another example.

So um, and then um, obviously we were we had

to, to get some data and they so happened we

knew Tom Fujiwara, who is uh, is a Princeton political

economist who had published work on um rankings in, in

Brazilian, uh, Brazilian elections.

So we asked Tom and he gave us the data.

And the data in Brazil is interesting.

You know, we had for, Uh, for elections.

Uh, and Brazil has about 5000 councils and a host

of parties.

However, um, Brazil also has an open list system.

As I mentioned at the beginning, uh, so it's not

exactly the same context.

Uh, moreover, the powerful politicians in Brazil, one of three

people in the council board, but it's the local mayor,

and the local mayor is separately elected, perhaps in the

final, uh, papers on on whether mayors are corrupt in,

in in Brazil.

It's all about the mayor.

So what we ended up doing was that we thought

about these council elections, which are conducted at a different

point in time, and the mayor Mayoral elections as the

primaries.

And we ask, does the person who win in these

primaries, meaning that within party vote, uh, within the council

election, have a larger, uh, chance of appearing as a

mayor candidate in the next mayor election?

So this seemed to be the, the, the, the plausible

thing to do.

And then in the end, uh, we found that the

regression is also in the paper.

Uh, um, the probabilities are lower, uh, but the relative

effect is about the same.

So the baseline is 3% and it's increased to 5%.

If you win the local council within party election.

So about the 60%.

If so, then it was fine.

for the editor.

So that's.

How it happens in the wonderful world of.

Publishing.

So I think it's fair to say that this was

a fun paper to write, because it was a depends

on whether it's fun or not.

Also depends on how perverted your preferences are about, you

know, what you're doing.

Interests are, I guess.

But, um, uh, at least it's a little bit of

a discovery, this primary effect.

Nobody knew about it.

And, uh, we think there is a pretty large and

arguably causal effect of winning the most preference votes on,

uh, becoming a local party leader.

And then the maybe it's just a coincidence, but it's

a similar, uh, effect in, in the semi-open system of

Sweden and the open the system of Brazil.

Uh, so this earlier critique that said that these reforms

are, uh, really a failure.

Uh, they were correct when they talked about this as

a representation mechanism, but maybe they were not, uh, didn't

think about accountability mechanisms.

Uh, so, uh, it's important to think about the broader

context.

Uh, this is still only suggestive.

Uh, you know, in terms of theory, we need to

better understand voting with downstream effects, because this is an

instance of that in terms of mpc's.

Uh, there's still a question of external validity.

Do we see this in other countries as well?

Don't have.

We don't have personal data other people might have.

So.

And then I guess 1st May also wonder, is this

important for for things that voters would care about.

So, you know, if party leaders are appointed by their

personal popularity because they win the most votes, um, do

they select policy in any different way than those that

were becoming party leader by appointment of the of the

party?

Uh, maybe it is the case that if you have

a broad electoral support, broad enough to get a lot

of preference votes, they may think that you have a

mandate from the voters, uh, to pursue a particular policy,

in particular, if you conduct the local campaign with, uh,

promises of a particular kind of night.

And maybe you may be popular.

Uh, and we need to.

We need to know that before we jump to normative

conclusions.

It may look good that, you know, you have these

primary elections, but this is these guys, uh, who have

the primary support, pursue weird policies.

Uh, then that's not so great.

Maybe the Tuesday example, the upcoming Tuesday example makes us

think about that possibility.

But, you know, in principle, when you think about, uh,

you know, conducting such a, such a study and then

the current design, the one with the, with this within

party, what would serve as the first stage.

And.

The second stage would be a point in that way

Foreign policy.

Good or bad policy?

Uh, particularly so.

One would have to find the money, for example.

All right.

So, um, the next one is a little bit more

intricate, so we might need a little bit more time,

but we can take 20 minute breaks.

Come back.

To me.

I'm sorry I didn't get your name.

It's okay.

Okay, now the question.

Uh.

I'm.

Sorry.

Either way.

Sorry.

It reminded me.

I think he was thinking about.

You axis of change becomes true.

Okay, let's.

Say that climate change comes across in an issue.

Yeah.

And you're suggesting that you would like you and Sam

up?

Yeah.

I'm.

Thinking like, generally the way that that would be in

the specification and that because the product is everywhere, but

it's going to be rather than vertical.

But there's a sort of new branch of literature that

looks at growing awareness.

So it's trying to extend like a Bayesian update framework

or something like to let.

That.

Naturally define.

The space and that sort of things.

So Evan Pearman has a slightly different.

Adam is a theorist, a Royal Holloway has a couple

of papers that look at different ways that you might

consider updating to those sorts of images.

It was just about yeah, that's.

Yeah, I.

Think it is.

In fact, we are working on somewhat related issues.

Um, you know.

The question is.

When or I guess it's part of your question to

when does the new issue appear in as a main

political issue?

You know, we have seemingly we have all have had

for a long time, at least.

Last I mention or redistributed the intention to drive.

People talk about left rights for things.

That didn't exist in the 1700s.

Yeah, yeah, but.

But then from time to time, the second dimension appears

in this.

And, you know, uh, Google and Rosendahl have estimated, based

on voting in the US Congress that the positions of,

uh, uh, Congress people all the way from the International

Congress.

Mhm.

Uh, and sometimes in the second dimension.

Mhm.

So during some periods like, you know, the uh over

tariffs and protection is that they uh.

Yeah.

Uh, there is a second dimension and then there's prohibition

for a while and which sort of runs it's not

counter at least separate from that.

Yeah.

And and we are working on thinking about this.

You know, people talk about the time dimension, which is,

uh, you know, um, the alternative to, uh, liberal versus

traditional nationalist.

Obviously, this is mixing up different things.

But if you look at, you know, green policies on

the one hand and policies towards, uh, you know, migration

or trade on the other, they are in people's minds.

They are very negatively correlated.

Right.

So those are my green.

Um.

Also like migration.

And also when I restrict right migration like so sometimes

now people talk about environmental populism as a sort of

counter play against fighting against green policies.

In Sweden we have, you know, a green, uh, the

Green Party was in coalition with the Social Democrats and

managed to push things through.

Then there was a new coalition and not the coalition,

but support from Sweden Democrats.

You know, they are decreasing taxes on gasoline.

So it seems that something is going on in that,

uh, in that second dimension which involves, you know, new

parties, both green parties and right parties, although they pull

in different directions.

So we are trying to to set up a model

framework Yeah.

You know, looking at the conditions for all the entry,

I get it.

Connecting the entry lenses.

See a green party appearing.

But what difference does it make?

Uh, a theory would a party would increase its instrumental

instrumentalist entry only when it thinks it can affect things.

Because it's costly to, uh, in various ways to to

interest or to run a campaign or, uh, that just

sees.

I think you I think my hypothesis is that that's

two different reasons why I think the environmental versus immigration

access is interesting, because I feel like a lot of

the immigration public itself feels very opportunistic.

So there's like an anti-immigration sentiment which is seized upon

and people are already like.

Immigration has been a big issue for many, many, many

years and something to be seized upon, whereas.

So that's like an opportunistic motivation for people to form

a party or gather or to form a platform that

can gather those voters, whereas environmental, one is interested in

that.

It's of something.

It's a new science that people have become aware of.

So it is.

The the common phenomenon is that it's sort of it's

not that necessarily that people think differently than okay, but

they put a much larger weight on these issues.

And so if you.

And at some point people didn't know anything about climate

change.

So the question is whether it's information or whether it's,

uh, you know, people have been knowing about the destruction

And since Rachel Carson wrote a book in the 60s,

or at least some people know about it, maybe it's

in the past, but what I'm.

Getting is very nice.

And then.

So I guess what I'm saying is something like this.

So, uh, so suppose you have, um, left and right,

and then you have green and uh, traditionalists or uh,

and, you know, the in the past.

Yeah.

People may have had a view on this.

So suppose we write this point.

So the Social Democratic Party would be somewhere like here

and maybe, uh, um, uh, a Conservative party might be

here, a Green Party maybe down here and the radical

Right party, maybe some, uh, somewhat there, but where this,

you know, dominates politics a lot depends on how the

indifference curves, uh, look like.

And it's a big difference about, you know, having indifference

curves look like that or having indifference curves look like

that.

Uh, because, you know, whether this is a prospective coalition

partner, uh, or whether that party at all other people

will have to care about and salience in would somehow

change the slope of this indifference curve.

So how important do you think that the, the green

issue is versus, uh, the traditional class?

So that's why, you know, changes in salience is one

Prospective driver of entry authorities.

That's the that's one simple way of explaining.

But, you know, salience may arise also from people, from

beliefs rather than, you know, these these are values, uh,

of types of that.

Yeah.

Well, I think it's interesting.

The, um.

How the traditional versus green becomes negatively correlated.

I guess that's the that's the process I'm most interested

in.

Why?

How does that happen?

Because they don't seem necessarily that opposed to each other

as platforms.

I don't really say much about the other one.

Yeah.

So in our setting, you know, the the party contemplates

with, uh, Amalgamation of people who are supposed to use

like this.

They are thinking about, uh.

About am I going to enter or not?

And to enter I must make a difference.

So I must reach a certain size.

But, you know, it doesn't have to be a majority.

It's just that, uh, whoever is largest of these two

bodies might find more attractive to to bargain with me.

Uh, or they may not be able to form the

government without, you know, either bargaining with me if I

exist or bargaining with that party, if it if I

can steal enough votes so that none of these parties

is a as a majority, then they may be good

enough to empty because then we can trade.

If I care a lot about the grain issue and

this this body doesn't care so much about the grain

issue.

And there is scope for gains from trade.

So, you know, I will maybe move a little bit,

Make a policy so that the, you know, becomes more

or less stays, and they will give me some green

policies in return.

And if we have different sloping indifference curves, then that's

going to be a win for increasing trade.

Uh, for us, we both gave.

The indifference curves of the parties or.

The voters.

Also, they are sort of small, uh, sandy things that

it's a cloud about this year.

And, you know, depending on how many the density of

that cloud in different options here, uh, you know, that's

what decides how many votes we'll get.

If there is another big cloud here, then of course,

I collect strength.

The more credible threat to the other point.

So I mean, it's it's a bit, Uh, preliminary, but,

uh, I think the ideas are quite clear.

And you see this happening.

I think this this most of the, the, the Green

Social Democrat coalition and, uh, the, the contract between the

Democrat and the centre, right, uh, where, you know, they

moved right on the economic issue, but they got the

migration restriction, uh, you know.

Well, they can't.

I mean, you don't even need coalitions to get that

either.

All you need is assistance.

And then, of course, uh, that made me people change

their mind.

But, uh, maybe there are new voters who come in.

They are young and, uh, you know, uh, parties, to

the extent they can commit to, to policies that will

want to follow the voters over time.

There are all sorts of reasons why policy.

Might change and.

Obviously.

Change.

Yeah, I guess I'm more interested in why does the

why does this dimension appear?

Yeah.

Yeah.

That's that's, uh, that's what we have also been thinking

about.

And even then, you know, it's it's easy.

We have a, have a draft which is uh, uh,

which was uh, submitted, but uh, people didn't like enough

to give us a revised resubmit.

And maybe they were right.

Um.

Because more.

Like proximate.

Determinants.

Like, there are, you know, we literally were assuming that,

you know, there are these different sloped indifference curves, so

enough and need to be enough salience in this election.

The next question is why try to become more sane?

And of course, there are some drivers.

That is.

Uh, that's what you started by.

Okay.

But it's a complicated one.

But, yeah.

The entry and exit.

It does remind me of the entry and exit models

as well.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Exactly.

Uh, or as we've discussed in I o there is.

Yeah.

As well here.

Somehow power, at least for an electric, is an indivisible.

Whereas in a market market share.

All these things.

It's a different.

The media entry and exit ones are different than a

media entry and exit you have.

Then you can find information, right.

And then the information moves the process.

So each of the engines are doing information.

You're.

Yeah yeah Yeah.

So I think that's me as well.

And maybe the problem is somehow to, to, to to

get a simple enough model of the political process because,

you know, we know how to do the competition.

Uh, three party competition for party competition.

Uh, so again but then, you know, if tacked on

to this is a, you know, post-election, uh, um, legislative

bargaining stage about who is going to be by whom.

It's like this.

I just say the bargaining model we studied in the

beginning.

Of the.

Of the course where, you know, the biggest party and

they beget the, uh, the speaker or the king or

whoever, uh, it is a party.

Okay.

So for McGovern and she would make him try to

form a minimal winning coalition by giving up your on

offer to one of the other parties.

To.

Form a majority on the on the government platform.

So it's like legislative or normal.

And now you need to study both the direction and

the postelection bargaining and then the pre pre election entries.

So.

Yeah it's a little bit, a little bit uh difficult

but uh you know strong enough assumption.

Again of movement just through the threat of the party

entering.

Yeah.

Uh that may be so, so exactly.

So so so, um, uh, to the extent these guys

can, can commit themselves to be there rather than stay

here.

Question is whether they can credibly do so.

And presumably they'll have to recruit some politicians that are

arguing as category adjustment costs.

Yeah.

And, you know, there's a lot of inertia.

Yeah.

Whoops.

So we we have the discussion about examination, uh, uh,

with Gina And, uh, since this is another half course,

um, before it was a, you know, just part of

a of the DNA course, then it kind of makes

sense to us to have the examination relatively soon, meaning

around Christmas rather than in June.

And the examination.

Is there any way going to be writing a refereed

report or a paper related.

It's been.

Do you have a view?

Uh, it would be good to have the examination.

It doesn't matter to us.

So, you know, if you have a very strong, strong

views in advance.

I think that's.

Good to have it over with.

Perhaps anything.

Before Christmas.

So yeah.

I would say anything before Christmas is better.

Okay.

Sure it is that way then.

Didn't really enjoy the right.

Yeah yeah yeah yeah.

No, it would be a posted uh, assignment some, some

papers which you can pick in and write the report

on them and, you know, you'll have a deadline before

which that should be done.

But of course if I can fulfil that deadline earlier.

So.

If one must use the coverage.

Okay.

So we'll try to do that.

Uh, I think the last lecture is something like December

10th or.

Yeah.

Or such.

So, so we, we tried to have put the deadline

before Christmas if you change your mind sometime.

Okay.

So, um, uh, so this is, uh, let's turn to

the gender quotas.

So this is the same set of authors and, uh,

and now also entering the coalition.

So, uh, again, the very broad motivation, we can go

back to conditions for, for democracy, working, uh, maybe able,

competent politicians is one thing, but then, uh, even representation

is, is another thing.

And then, you know, uh, before we considered different socioeconomic

groups.

But there of course, there are other aspects in particular

like like gender to the extent that male and female,

uh, interests are different.

Uh, and, um, when it comes to the ability of

politicians and, you know, who are representing the body.

This sort of comes down to, you know, a lot

to what party leaders do because they have disproportionate power.

Over.

Who would represent the party.

Uh, and, uh, you know, there's one axiom that many

people a little bit is like quotas like to, to,

to, to go to, uh, and they think that, you

know, there's always meritocracy, uh, so that any appointments are

done for the better.

That's not.

Necessarily the case.

Uh, even though there may, may be some ability in

the Swedish system, but, uh, you know, leaders also think

about their own position and, you know, the more clever

politicians, uh, able politicians, they appoint, uh, to be, uh,

in the government or in the, in the ruling coalition

with them, maybe, uh, you know, their their position is

more threatened.

Same may be true if they appoint followers of a

different gender, uh, because there'll be competition from another direction.

So there is this possibility, which I guess is underlying

this paper, that mediocre leaders who try to defend their

position in this way, they can create a vicious circle

of mediocrity.

And, uh, you know, it becomes an old boys network

in a very real sense.

And maybe you need some shock to break.

Such networks up.

So specifically on, uh, this issue about gender quotas is

very contested.

Uh, I think it's 120.

Countries that.

Use one or another form of gender quota.

Some of them are mandated.

Uh.

So one of the most famous papers was in her

thesis here, uh, wrote about, uh, sort of, um.

Uh.

Reserved seats in the Indian, uh, political system for castes,

but then also reserved seats for women.

And we have seen the floors work on, on the

revolving, um, female leaders in, in Indian villages.

I, I assume if not, it's a beautiful paper to

look at.

Um, anyway, so these gender quotas are not only discussed

as I write here, they're also been, uh, introduced for

company boards in Norway and Germany.

Uh and discussed in many other countries.

And whenever the quota is, it's always the same thing.

The proponents they tend to appeal to equal representation and

sometimes to, to, you know, and exploited efficiency and the

opponents, they appeal to meritocracy, saying that a quota is,

uh, hazardous because, you know, it will force us to

have to appoint, um, uh, lousy, lousy leaders.

So it seems like an empirical question do quotas violate

meritocratic appointments or can they support them?

I notice such vicious circles of mediocrity that I mentioned

that.

There's little evidence to speak directly on this issue.

A little theory as well.

As a matter of fact, beyond this general reasoning.

So we're going to try and investigate it and.

Have some simple.

Theory to lead the way by looking at the 1993

poll in Sweden, Social Democrats.

And that's how the the name of the paper came

about.

So it's always a good idea to speak with people

who know the phenomenon you're investigating.

And in this case, we spoke to a lady in

your Segerstrom who was the second in command of this

of the Social democratic women when this was introduced.

And she volunteered the following information and didn't mind us

to alter either.

So our party's called the policy of Mandatory alternation of

male and female names on all party lists was informally

known as the crisis of the Mediocre Man in the

Women's Association.

So that's what she said.

More or less verbatim.

And anybody that's using that phrase.

That's what you did.

So and I'm going to take you through, uh, what,

that, uh, paper in the following way.

So first we're going to look at some simple model

exercise showing how all the leaders with a given ability

choose the ability of the followers.

And in the process, they trade off electoral success, which

is promoted by tolerability, uh, against their own survival, which

is, you know, affected in the opposite direction by having

more able followers.

Then we'll go to the data and show that there

seem to be some support for behaviour like that in

in the data.

So this is a start.

Then we look at the evidence.

So this is just correlations.

Then we look at the evidence.

What more likely a causal effect of the call to

um on ability.

And we looked at the ability not only of any

women that enter but also of the men.

And we'll see that this crisis of the mediocre men

is a very salient feature.

And then go back to the theory again and try

and make sense of, uh, these results by extending the

simple model.

Yeah.

So I'm not going to pretend here that we are

testing something.

Instead, theory can be used as a simple way of

interpreting, you know, a complex pattern in the data and

right to use Occam's razor, the simplest way we could

think of somehow making sense of the patterns in the

data that is.

Really, if we have been really preparing, we would have,

you know, when we went back to the data, may

not reinterpretation that new theoretical insights would have.

Given us some auxiliary predictions and also the truly tested,

which is that that's the wrong.

Way to manage.

To do that.

Okay, so I guess related research here, if you want

to think about whether it makes a difference with, uh,

uh, Ability and gender, then you are almost necessarily thinking

about a citizen candidate, because it's only then that the

features of the representation do matter for policy and therefore

for, for, uh, how well you fare among the voters.

Um, it relates to models of political selection.

There is a theoretical literature on that, where each of

the components that you're going to see has figured, but

I mean separately.

So ability is a good thing for voters.

There's literature on that.

I go back to Jeff Banks and others.

Uh, choice of mediocre leaders may compromise, uh, competence and

diversity.

It's a paper about that.

And, um, survival of leaders may depend on the composition

of who else is in the party.

There's a paper about that.

We sort of put them together.

Um.

Yeah.

And then about gender quotas, there's quite a bit of

work.

There's, uh, some descriptive work about, uh, you know, the

numeric impact on representation, the spread of reforms of case

studies.

Uh, and then there are attempts of looking at the

effects of quotas and that show that these quotas are

often evaded.

For example, in Spain had a 40% of the, uh,

of the candidates on the list had to be women,

but and most of the women were placed at the

bottom of the list, so nobody got elected.

So, uh, status aside, our census paper, um, they also

show that Nevertheless, it seemed to have affected vote shares,

especially in male dominated parties.

And then there are some attempts of looking at the

behaviour of women that are elected on the quota and

compare them to the men.

Uh, and there's no difference, significant difference in education.

But education, as we know, is only a proxy for

for ability.

Um, and they appear to be equally active in politics,

uh, in terms of writing bills, speaking in Parliament, such.

Uh, such measures.

So let me do this now.

So first, to show you that simple model.

Look at the results.

Probability This is a prequel to and then try to

make sense theoretically of the results.

So what's the context?

Well, we're going to look at municipal party leaders.

So to get the numbers up, we look at these

298 municipalities and look at them over time.

Um, before the quota was introduced, about 80% of all

first positions on the party ballots were held by men

in the Social Democrat.

It was 83%.

These party leaders, as I said, control the composition of

the party list.

There is often a selection committee close to the party

leader, uh, who proposes an electoral list Companies taking nominations

into account or having an internal primary.

But, um, yeah, the leaders have disproportionate influence.

Um, there's a members meeting that, uh, approves the party

list before it's sent to the election authority, but it

tends to these members meetings tend to make few changes,

according to survey evidence.

And, uh, in general, as I've said already, uh, party

leaders are important.

So let's look at, uh, a very, very simple model

just to get the thinking going.

So consider the motion for a municipal council, which has

two parties.

Label the parties okay, as we usually do.

Uh, call one of them for social Democrats and one

for the bourgeois, Um, and um, there are politicians to

types and politicians and mediocre politicians and the share of

the competent, uh, politicians.

We will label by our k um, and um, the

more the larger that share of competent politicians.

Um, there are voters.

So voter pay off is increasing in r k uh,

and that's a, uh, a crucial assumption.

So ability or competence is violence for voters.

Then, uh, we introduce party leaders.

They have a competence l k that's not going to

be 0 or 1.

It's going to be in the interval from 0 to

1, where a higher LQ is more competent.

So if there are two types of politicians, why are

there leaders that are continuously competent?

Well, here with basically the data, we are going to

approximate the leadership of the party with the three first

politicians.

So depending on whether they are competent or like LK

can take the value of zero, one third to third

or one.

So that's how we're going to measure the data right.

The model.

So party competence is going to be a weighted average

of leader and follower competence.

So the competence of the ballot in party K is

alpha times LK plus one minus alpha times RK.

Where alpha can be a mechanic depending on how many

people there are, or it can be a substantive way

if you want to upgrade the leadership and treat it

as a parameter so it doesn't feel.

Right.

That's the basic structure of the event.

Each party has a leader with competence or leadership with

competence.

So each of these leaders chooses a share of competent

followers.

And then a council election is held.

If the body has a higher competence that it offers

to the voters, it has a larger chance of winning.

And then there's the popularity shock for each leader that

is realised.

And that's followed by a contest in each party where

the leader's survival chances is increasing in the distance between

their own competence and the followers competence.

Now.

Other words, it's somewhat stochastic, except when you start to

think about whom to appoint.

But, uh, you know, the the greater the distance between

you and the followers to the greater your chance of

surviving as party leader until the next period.

So now we can set that equilibrium.

I'm going to make some simplifying assumptions.

So the leadership concept concept let's assume that the leader

is going to survive.

If that competence gap this popularity shock is, uh negative.

Meaning that her own competence is, uh, a larger than

the one of the followers plus the shock.

And let's assume that this popularity shock has a cumulative

distribution function that we denote by q So monotonic.

Suppose that is symmetric around zero with the log concave

density lowercase q.

So now the probability of leader survival is just as

the cdf evaluated at lk minus k.

Given the that we have the CDF for the for

the epsilon shock.

And as I said, that popularity shock is not known

at this stage when you choose the composition.

Of the list.

We have council election voters get utility, let's just say

proportional to the competence of each party.

If for the case winning.

So competence is violence.

Again, voters do not care about whether the leader survived

the.

Beyond the fact that they add to the confidence of

the party.

And then there's competition for voters.

So think about a standard probabilistic model that we learned

to model.

Nothing like.

So the probability that already wins is given by cdf

p, which is increasing in its relative competence to the

other party.

Let us assume that the CDF has a pdf P,

which has a maximum and at zero.

So the inflection point of the CDF is uh it's

steepest.

Yeah.

So and uh, the rest is plain sailing.

So you go to the list design stage and think

about the least choice by the leader in body.

So picking Confidence is equivalent to picking the the body's

confidence because you have your own.

Uh.

Let's suppose that there are some immigrants e from surviving

as a leader, and there are some, uh, office rents

uh, uppercase, which are normalised to one from the party

winning.

So this is from winning the election.

This is from holding.

The holding the.

The.

Party leader position.

So it's an eagle eagle rank in that sense.

So now the expected payoff when I choose D is

going to be the probability that I survive times that

trend.

That's the probability that to win the election times that

trend which is won by assumption.

And uh, if I choose, uh, a more, uh, a

better, uh, set of followers that increases our probability of

winning the election.

It decreases my probability of survival.

So it's a trade off, and I'm going to.

Pick a point where those forces balance, and we get

back to the densities I.

Defined on the previous page.

Okay, so that that's super simple.

Uh, there's going to be a parallel condition for, for

would it be.

So second equation.

And then we can do some comparative statics on that.

Uh so suppose D is ruled by a more uh

better leader with a higher uh LD.

Sorry.

Uh, and then Um.

It's two equations you have to do.

Comparative statics is Cramer's rule or your favourite way of

solving those two equations.

And you'll find that in any political equilibrium, a more

competent leader.

Will pick.

More competent.

Candidates.

And therefore a more mediocre leader picking more mediocre candidate.

So this says that to the extent there are these

concerns of personal power versus the party state, and there

is the tendency of this kind of media mediocrity, um,

uh, that, uh, circles.

So is that is there something like that we can

see in the data?

So then, uh, we take a look at the data

from the election authority study.

Ten waves of election from 82 to 2014.

We nevertheless drank of each politician.

Uh, and we link it to this socio economic data,

uh, that you have seen already.

And, uh, we use the data on education, sex, occupation

and location to calculate this earnings score, which I see

last week as a measure of competence for men and

women.

And as you remember, we we take each annual cross-sectional

wages uh, or earnings which for individual I in irt

uh we allow to be dependent on their age, their

education level, their occupation, broad occupation, uh, to have a

municipality fixed effect and then to have an error term

or a residual term.

And then this function has a separate fixed effect for

each of these terms, and the separate fixed effect for

each interaction between between these and then one for the

interaction for all three.

Um, so it's a pretty general specification.

We estimate it separately for men, women and retired people.

We get the residual for each individual.

And then uh, we average that residual over, uh, all

years, for which we have data for the individual.

And the, uh, that individual fixed effect is our.

Measure.

Of the earnings score, which is the confidence of that

of the politician.

We argue.

Then we define a binary measure of that as, as

in the model, so that you're either mediocre or competent.

Uh, and uh, as I said, we let the leadership

that should be the average competence of the party's top

three ranked candidate, and our K would be the average

across every elected politician except those top three.

So, uh, in the paper when we launched this measure,

we felt we needed to, to, um, to validate it.

So we validate it by correlating it with this leadership

and cognitive scores for the men.

You saw that correlation matrix last week as positive but

not certainly not perfect.

We tried to validate it by political success.

Table one of the paper shows that this earnings score

is that is correlated with the preference vote share that

that a individual politician gets with her re-election and with

her least rank, um, and with the top rank.

So it seems to be correlated with uh, with political

success as well as even though it's a measure of

relative earnings.

In your your own cell.

And then we define that to say that, uh, to

be a convincing measure of, of confidence, you know, if.

Politicians are more competent than vote, they should be more

happy.

So we look in table two of the paper, you

can you can check there's some, Um, the satisfaction index

that has been collected for a number of years across

Swedish municipalities.

And we correlate that, uh, um, voter satisfaction index, uh,

with the earning score, average earning score of members of

the majority party.

And we find the positive correlation.

So that was okay.

So in the end we got away with using this

as a measure of political competence.

So now I'm trying to look at, uh, you know,

this correlation between the, the, the binary residual of the,

uh, on the list with the competence of the leaders.

So this, uh, is just to take the lag to

three components and, and, uh, run, you know, the, the,

the follower competence on that, that's, that's positively correlated with

election period fixed effects added.

You know I use lag top three competence not theory.

Doesn't really say it's lagged or it's current top three

competence.

Both are correlated with uh with follower competence.

But if you run a horse race between them, it

seems to be that the lack of, uh, wins out.

Um, maybe, uh, one could say that this correlation just

captures a lot of persistence in, in competence across municipalities.

Uh, so let's include lagged follower competence and explain, current.

Or.

Not explain but correlate with today's um leader competence with

current follower competence.

So that survives.

Yeah, the municipality fixed effect goes down a little bit

but is still positively correlated.

We have the municipality times party fixed effect.

Then this correlation doesn't survive.

We replace the the the minor income residual with the

cognitive or leadership score from the draft at the cost

of only looking at male politicians and the positive correlations.

So there seem to be a correlation that, you know,

good leaders have better followers.

Other aspect of the model, uh, that I showed you

was that people were afraid to lose power if they

had more competent followers.

That's an assumption.

Um, so we tried to study shocks to follow a

competence.

And the way we did that was roughly to look

at opinion polls to the extent they exist for a

municipality, otherwise for the party in the national elections.

Then look at deviations from from that in the.

Opinion polls at the time when people have to be

put on the ballot and then after elapses, there are

surprises.

Some parties end up with more people than they thought.

Other people end up with less people than they thought.

Uh, and we can measure the, the competence of the

additional people that came in.

And, uh, it seems that such shocks that induce more

competent followers decreases the chance of survival.

Uh, of the leaders.

So but that's correlational evidence is not well identified anyway.

So let's look at uh, let's look at, uh, the

quota, uh, that was introduced.

So as I said in 1993, the Social Democrats uh,

introduced uh is called from the central, uh, party.

So there was, uh, prehistory History where female members had

sought for better representation.

There have been recommendations in the party before the 1998

to 1991 elections to have at least 40 to 50%

women.

Uh, but, you know, the average stood at something like.

35, 30.

Uh.

Between 30 and.

40.

And 82% of the 83% of the local party leaders

were men.

So there was a lot of disgruntlement, uh, among the

female politicians.

And there, there was, uh, talk, uh, serious talk about

the founding, uh, a new, more feminist, uh, organisation on

the left, which would encompass not only, uh, social democratic

female politicians, but liberal female politicians and green female politicians.

And apparently that threat was credible enough that the party

decided to introduce this zipper quota on the local groups.

And the zipper quota, uh, is, you know, a way

to avoid the Spanish outcome for all the women and

the data list.

Instead, it has to be like a zipper.

Every second person man.

Every second person.

So this is a, uh, you know, election to the

municipal council in a suburb to Stockholm, municipalities for the

Social Democrats.

And here, you see, Ulrik is on top gun is

a woman.

Sven.

Eric is a man.

Eleanor is a woman.

And you get the point.

So it's, uh.

And, uh, with that, uh.

So Democrats had those 35%, uh, in the 1991 election

turned out to be something like 47 in the, in

the 1994 election.

So why not?

And it's because of the randomness of the electoral outcome.

If the majority of the, of the men, uh, of

the party leaders were still men and you had an

odd number of politicians, then you know, there'd be more

men than women.

If you elect an even number of operations, it would

be 50%.

But there are some odd numbers that brings the average.

Right.

Uh, so, um.

So this is pretty clear, uh, in in that election

year was the recommendation, and here was the recommendation, uh,

in for the 81 and 1991.

Didn't matter so much.

Somewhat upward trend, but not so much.

There were other parties that made recommendations.

So the Centre Party in large on the countryside, Swedish

municipalities had a similar recommendation in for the 1990 um

eight election.

Nothing much happened, and the Conservative Party had a recommendation

about 40 to 50% in the same election as the

quota.

Nothing much happened relative to relative to track.

So that's the aggregate three series.

Instead, look at the.

At the cross-section.

Uh, in some interesting elections.

So again, if we look at the conservatives who had

this recommendation in the 1994 election, uh, look at the

change in the share of elected women at this distribution.

It's basically centred at zero with a slight positive change.

Right.

That's the one you saw in the time series.

Look at the centre Party.

That's the dotted line.

So they had their recommendation that applied in the 1998

election.

Again doesn't make much difference.

The distribution is kind of centred at zero.

And here the the dashed line would be the Social

Democrats super quota in the 1994 election.

And as you can see now, the centre of gravity

is moving out.

So you have see a positive change.

And in fact, yeah, there are a few where there

is a negative number.

But those were the places where there were already close

to 50.

Um, so there was by this, this quota, in fact,

the difference between um, between the, the prequel to equilibrium

and 50%, we're going to label that the bite of

the quota and use in our empirical in our investigation.

So, uh, why do we do that?

So the quote, um, may The idea is that may

have disrupted this cosy coexistence of mediocre May leaders and

followers.

And then, you know, that disruption, uh, would be larger

if the quota by, uh, was larger, meaning, uh, the

difference between 50% and the pre-election share of women.

Because the more you'll have to change the, the, the

local party ballot.

So there would be less room for mediocre leaders to

survive by picking mediocre followers.

So, um, this is a qualitative assumption.

I get some support though.

The the female social Democrats, uh, the Women's Association had

a handbook, which we have which talks about, you know,

now it's important after this victory.

To have the call today that we turned the numbers

into influence.

Uh, so there was an attempt of grabbing the these

new positions of influence politics.

So as you can you can imagine, we are going

now to to use the introduction of the quota empirically

to specify a difference in difference, uh, uh, formulation that

is not, uh, you know, one zero is going to

be a dose and response.

Uh.

Formulation.

We have the height of the quota we measure as

the distance between the, the women elected between 50% and

what it was in the 1991 election.

So we're going to run.

Uh, dependent variables, which is the the the confidence of

the of the people below the leadership on that and

a post called the dummy and uh municipality fixed factor

and an error term, or we're going to do a

dynamic difference in the difference.

And here there's a summation sign missing and I apologise

for that.

But so we run it year by year and allow

the coefficient to vary.

By by election.

If we do it for all editions, uh, uh, we

get a significant positive effect on, on follower competency if

we include a municipality time trend.

But what if we exclude it?

If we run it for female politicians, we don't see

anything on their competence.

Uh, whichever fixed effects we include.

But if we run it for a male politician, we

see a clear effect on positive effect on their on

their content.

And the size of that is on the order.

You know, in a typical social democratic district, you get

one more competent, uh, politician rather than a mediocre politician.

Um, among the following.

That's takes a bit of a translation, but, uh.

That's roughly.

If we look at the dynamic make difference in difference.

That's kind of more interesting.

This is for all politicians.

So you see this, there's this, uh, old line, uh,

uh, increasing competence, uh, for after the quota, uh, uh,

for the three first years after the quota was introduced.

But once you look separately on men and women.

It's a clear effect for that is an effect for

the men, and there's no effect for the women sitting

at, uh, and zero in these three elections.

And the effect for the men sort of dies out

and, uh.

Yeah.

For women as.

Well.

So then, you know, the, the, the, the, the best

comment we, we had or the most significant comment to

go to when Presenting this paper around was okay, but

isn't this effect on the man just a mechanical experience?

You know, the man used to be 70.

65% of the ballot.

And then, you know, you're restricted to be a maximum

50% or a little above 50%.

And if part is cut from the bottom in terms

of quality, that's what you see mechanically.

So maybe, you know, showing the effect of, uh, of

the quartile, you're just showing the effect of the, you

know, uh, a ranking by ability along the bottom.

So that was obviously something we had to take a

stance on.

Uh, before doing that, we showed that there were a

lot it was robust.

The results we have so far was lost to a

number of specification checks.

Uh, but yeah, we're kind of, uh, looking at that

mechanical effect.

So, uh, this is for all leaders and all followers,

men and women.

But it's more instructive, I think, to to look at,

uh, uh, at the men separately, because that's what the,

the issue is.

And here you see that if it were a mechanical

thing, we would only see it among the followers.

Right.

Because those were the ones that were, were being cut

from the bottom.

But in fact, the clearest effect we see is in

the first election after the quota with, uh, where the

leaders become more equal.

Right.

And then only with.

you, the showrunners become more confident in the next election.

So if I want it to to appeal to the

model, uh, that we looked at before that didn't have

men and women, it's as if the leaders had to

become more competent so that they dared to appoint more

competent followers.

At least that was true among women.

So can we make.

Sense empirically of this?

Uh, um.

These intriguing time patterns.

But the competence of the male leaders improves in 94

and followers only in the next two elections.

So one possibility is that this would reflect resignations of

the leaders, but then the resignation rate would have to

be larger among the mediocre leaders than among the, uh,

the competent leaders for the patent to fit.

So then to check that we estimate a resignation equation

or a survival equation among the individual, uh, leaders.

So you can run that either as a, a triple

difference, you know, to what extent if you are a

leader who is competent and or mediocre, uh, not to

quote, uh, make you, uh, resign or not, uh, or

you can just run this difference in different separately for

the competent and mediocre leaders, but equivalent more or less,

uh, modular how to fix it.

And here is, uh, what you see, if you, uh,

do that to estimations separately.

These are the mineral leaders.

These are the.

Communicators.

And as you can see, the it's the guys that,

uh, that do not survive, whereas the, uh, competent ones

do survive, or they there's no difference in their survival

factor, uh, relative to before the quarter.

Uh, and here is what you get when you run

the triple difference.

You see that?

It's the mediocre.

Ones, uh, that are those very same.

So that's, uh, that's the the notion empirically seems to

be the case.

The quarter, uh, is He's entered.

There.

Is no difference in in in what how the the

current leaders act.

But the mediocre once they resign to greater extent is

on average leaders more competent.

And those more competent leaders then can select more competent

focus.

Areas where some some theory might help in order to

put these eggs all in in right place.

Right.

So can we make sense of these results.

So what I propose to do is simple model that

we looked at in the beginning, and then extend it

to include both men and women.

Before we had just, uh, competent and mediocre.

Right now we have competent, mediocre and men and women.

So let's distinguish male and female candidates.

So let's focus on party D because that's the party

that will have the quota.

They appoint w d share a women along with a

share of competent followers at stage two of the model.

This is the design stage.

But then for this to to affect choices, the preferences

of the representative voter must be recognised.

Men and women.

Right.

So.

So we as before, we assume that the utility to

voters represent the voters of having the Democrat Social Democrats

in power.

Is this competence term that we had already before.

But then there is a, uh, a concave view of

the shadow women.

And we assume that this is a kind of.

A concave function with a maximum of one.

Half.

Y, a maximum of one half, where the turnout rate

for men and women are about the same.

So it says that the average voter, uh, uh, would

like half women, half men.

So this function is increasing, uh, in one half and

then decreased.

Okay.

So that's about your preferences.

Now we have to before we have leadership survival.

Um.

Stage two, we should say stage four.

I think because that's happened at the end of the

end of the time.

So before we had.

R e minus LD plus epsilon less than one half.

Uh, so that more able followers represented a threat to

survival that's now generalised that then saying that there's a

threat function sigma which is increasing in uh, the the

share of competent followers is also increasing in the share

of women.

If it's a male leader, there's more chance not to

survive.

If it turns out, if there are more women on

the in the in the council delegation.

So we can now we can write the probability of

survival as a leader as l d minus sigma.

This way q we still the CDF of the epsilons.

Right now.

What is the optimal choice of candidates?

Well, let's focus on the partial equilibrium quantity.

Make choices for a given given choices by the other

party.

Let's first look at the unconstrained optimal ie.

When you can choose both women and con uh, the

gender composition and the component score composition freely.

So.

Um, for the share of them, we'll get the conditions

such as this one.

You know, you have some effect on the threat function.

It was an increasing function times the, uh, the density

times the gradient of surviving.

And then you get the effect on the voters and

the chance of winning the election.

And again, that's the trade off.

Uh, that makes you pick a share of a optimum

share of competent politicians for the share of females.

Instead, you'll have you decrease your the likelihood of your

survival because you increased the threat times the density.

And, uh, you have an effect here that has a

sign depending on whether you are above or below one

half, because this utility of the representative is first increasing

and decreasing up to half that since this is a

negative number.

For this to be an interior solution, that has to

be a positive number.

In other words, we have to be on the portion

of the voter popularity function which is the increase, and

that's the portion that is below 50%.

Okay.

So this think about this as the prequel to equilibrium.

This is my leader.

since by having female followers because it threatens his own

survival.

Uh, so to balance that threat against the electoral advantage

of picking more women.

He stops a bit below 50%.

Uh.

Makes a compromise in order to foster his own survival.

Okay, so now what happens if you introduce a quota

in this module?

So suppose the Centre Party sets, uh, says you can

no longer take the share women freely.

You have to put it at w w would be

one half in the in our empirical application.

So now, uh, you know, w is no longer w

d is no longer a choice variable.

It's set that w, and then, uh, we can carry

out the constrained optimisation by just picking the share of

competent.

Uh, and that would for, uh, an equation such as

this one where I have sort of, uh, said that

the share of competent is given by the, the competence

of the leaders and the quote that it is prescribed

from the body centrally.

So this condition will now define the share of confidence.

And then I can approximate the effect of competence in

by setting the quota at one half.

Uh, I can compute the change in the share of

competent by just taking the derivative of, uh, this Function

and integrating it from the prequel to equilibrium to the

postulated one half.

So that's, um, roughly, if you take the take that

that's we can approximate that by the, by the, by

the derivative times the integration boundaries one half minus lambda.

However, this doesn't make us much right because the sine

of this derivative is undefined.

So this doesn't help.

The only thing that helps is that, you know, we

see here that the effect is proportional in this municipality

to the right of the equilibrium difference to one half.

So at least we did something right when we ran

the, uh, empirical specification based on the quarterback.

Uh.

But, um, this doesn't make us much happier if we

look at the effect on leadership survival.

We also don't get anything because we have a derivative

which is on the financial side.

So something is missing here.

And what is missing, I think, is this role for

resignations because, uh, we didn't allow that in, in, in

the model.

Right.

Whereas the informal reasoning I had about the data had

this discussion about who would be more likely to resign

once the code was.

Was introduced.

Yes.

Is there not was a role for commitment as well

over the share of women?

So yeah.

Even if you believe that the ability distributions are the

same of women and men, then if you are able

to commit to, say, a quota to 50, then that

means that you can choose less like the x from

the x post distribution.

So there's an incentive for leaders to commit to a

quota, right.

Because they can.

That's part of a trade off is it means that

they can have less competent, um, followers in general.

Right.

Because they can't select on all of uh.

Yeah.

And they just can never select.

I mean, one needs to think about maybe I'm not

understanding your point, but, you know, this is a, a

real commitment in the sense that, you know, who will

be elected will, uh, be.

Yeah.

This doesn't, uh, take preference votes into account.

But if you we abstained from the the preference order

and beginning preference was not allowed.

They were only allowed from the 1998 election.

You deliver your budget, you print it and you send

it to the election authority, and then you know, the

voters and the vote chair will decide, uh, who will

be elected.

Those in the first X positions on the on the

ballot.

And, you know, you're picking that time designing the list.

So once you have delivered your ballot, which you do

six months before the election, then you have committed to.

Okay.

So it is just the share of women candidates.

Sorry.

Not okay.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I'm making an assumption that, you know, you can pick

these shares independently of how many people are getting it.

And that's not strictly right.

So but there's no ex post fiddling here.

Uh, in the, in what we're trying to model because

you sort of just once your your ballot is there

still.

I think that's still if you are restricting the choices

to 50% men, 50% women, and that's still not necessarily

going to be the optimal distribution for expose for the,

um, yeah, the, the uh, voters to select the candidates

on.

So there's another it's another tool if they are to

commit this one of these is to use.

Right.

If they maybe.

Yeah.

Um.

Yeah.

But uh, but then the voters need to be able

to reallocate, uh, their vote, uh, and, you know, uh,

earlier, I guess in the previous paper, I argued that,

uh, that voters, uh, didn't say so much about whether

voters strategically voted more for the competent than for the

for the non competent, uh, that they could uh and

then.

Yeah.

But that requires I think uh, uh, discretionary choice of

the voters among the candidates on the list.

And they don't have that, at least in the beginning,

because the quota election is 94 and then the other

one.

Is introduced.

Anyway.

So I think what what was missing was the resignations.

So let's in in the game introduce a new stage.

Let's call it one and a half, which happens before

the choice of the of the least composition.

So there is a leader who has survived from the,

from the, from the past.

And now that the incumbent leader may resign.

And let's assume that if she resign, a new leader

with competence will going to be drawn at random.

So that new leader will pick, uh, a particular choice

of, uh, competence when the female quality is stable.

So why would any leader resign?

Well, the, you know, these leaders, they have two goals

in life.

One goal is to survive as party leaders.

But the other goal is to get the party to

win the election.

And now the mediocre leader realises that if she acts

in her own interest, she will appoint or he will

appoint.

He is much better here.

He would appoint a set of followers that are quite

incompetent.

In other words.

They will diminish the probability that the Social Democrats winning

the election.

So for some level of low competency, it becomes optimal

to resign.

Take a lottery on the on a new leader who

is on average more competent than I am.

And that person will make a better appointment, which makes

me happy because the Social Democrats win the election.

If I'm incompetent enough, that's going to be optimal.

Uh.

So in other words, there exists a Cut-Off in leader

competency such that.

He is below that I will resign.

And, uh, that cut off will be increasing in W

in the quarter because of the this that affects the

choices of this income.

Mediocre leader more so it's a bit like, you know,

you're the leader.

Uh.

For the company.

And, uh, you know, you are incompetent.

They want to replace you, uh, and, uh, you know,

you risk that, uh, that the company goes bankrupt, in

which case you won't get any severance payments, but you

can resign and you can get your, you know, your

package, and, uh, then the company can afford to pay

your severance package because they survived.

So there are these, uh, concerns that someone who is

mediocre enough that they realise that the, the being, the,

the, the, the CEO will lead to lead to, they

cannot handle the situation, they will resign as a competency

or.

Just.

Say, in fact.

They do need to be aware of their incompetence, their.

Yes, that's a big assumption.

Especially from.

That.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

And how do they know what residual they.

Have in the.

In the, in the regression.

Yeah.

That's the big assumption.

That's an.

Assumption.

Anyway.

So with this uh with quotation we can introduce a

quote and this setup and that will imply an approximate

cut off shift uh, which is, you know, the previous,

uh, Cut-Off without the quota and then the Cut-Off with

the quota.

And we can approximate that by this derivative.

Times one and a half.

Minus the prequel to equilibrium.

And this derivative, uh, is uh, has a known sign,

namely a negative sign.

So, um, the prediction is that a quote that raises

resignation rates for mediocre leaders with a larger effect at

the greater quarterback?

So this is the Occam's razor type model.

You may not think it was very simple, but it

was the simplest model we could cook up that is

consistent with these empirical results.

So it provides a.

Uh.

You know, a clear way of interpreting.

So.

So, um, the point here was to, uh, write down

the model that just articulated some intuitions about how candidate

ability can sometimes be chosen in a strategic way, so

that mediocre or mediocre leaders worry about surviving.

And then if a female quota shifts such leaders attention

from surviving to winning the elections, then leader turnover and

follower count will will rise.

And the other point of this paper was to introduce

a new measure of ability, namely discerning score.

And.

But the most important thing was the the I think

the substantive findings that there seems to be a link

between leader and follower competence state equal to raised competence

among the men.

This is not a mechanical effect because it was created

on the top rather than the Bottom.

And, uh, this can be seen as through this resignation

window.

And, uh, most importantly on the the broader question, it

is like in, in the in the previous lecture, uh,

more equal representation in this case across genders in the

first week, uh, in the previous week across social background

doesn't really compromise meritocracy.

Which is, I.

Guess, an optimistic.

Message about.

How political system might.

Might work.

Okay, so.

That's the end of these notes.

So so I'm done, uh, with what I wanted to

say.

So, you know, we we have plenty of time.

We can have talk individually or you can if you

have questions.

You can talk about those or.

You can use the time.

Productively for something else.

Yes.

Does this model that's the leader have to be male,

or does it change if the incumbent leader is a

woman?

Um.

Yes.

It would change if, uh, if the incumbent, uh, would

be would be a woman.

Uh, I.

Guess.

I haven't worked that case out because empirically, there were

83% leaders when the quota was introduced.

So we wouldn't have power to investigate it.

But one would expect, uh, the opposite effect, because the

if there was a female leader somehow randomly, uh, in

the initial equilibrium, then supposedly she will feel less threatened

If there were more women around, you know, modulo their

competence to still be a competence choice.

But, uh, this sigma function, the threat function will have

it have an opposite sign for a male leader in

the male leader.

So it would be, you know, if there were resignations

allowed, they.

Would.

Be more likely to, to stay.

Um.

Particularly.

Yeah.

If they.

Were.

If they were, you know, of average ability.

Uh.

Variable female leaders was would always stay uh, compared to

staffing would go in the opposite direction.

So if we have a large enough data set, we

could test that.

And that would.

Be.

Maybe an auxiliary prediction of the is interpretative model to

take through the data because it's, uh, it's.

Kind of specific, gender specific.

So maybe, uh, you haven't tried to.

Run.

That regression.

Maybe we should do.

With, uh, many, like, endogenously chosen quotas before the mandated

quota.

So you mean endogenous, as.

It were, artists choosing their own quotas before.

Okay.

With.

This this is not, uh, mandated by by the state.

It's not the state regulation.

It is, uh, it is, uh, um, uh, a party,

uh, central party regulation.

But since then, you know, the Greens, uh, and, and,

uh, and the last party, uh, have adopted similar, similar

protocols.

Well, there are quotas for lower numbers before.

No.

I mean, there are, uh, quotas are either voluntary, uh,

self-declared thing, but then you need some kind of enforcement,

uh, I guess, uh, so here the central party, uh,

has some leverage on the on the local local authorities.

Uh, and there are ways of punishing, uh, the municipality.

Uh.

If they really wanted to, to do this, they could,

could, uh.

Right.

So, but there are voluntary quotas, and then there are

mandated quotas, which can be different shape and form.

So they are imposed on all parties.

Uh, Like.

You know, a one example is which is kind of

interesting is, um, is South Korea.

So there's a, uh, former student called Jay Lee.

She works in Stockholm.

Not that I'm not an institute, but at the Department

of Economics.

And so she she works on many things.

Labour, uh, mostly, but she has some, some political papers

and one of them is about, um, quotas in, in

Korea, uh, where there were very, very few female politicians

up to the, to the early 2000s or late 90s,

at which point there was a regulation that, uh, one

out of ten seats would be reserved for for a

woman in each, uh, Korean municipality and what she shows

is that.

So that part is compliant with that.

But what happens is that over time the share of

women increases and they increase in a particular fashion.

So she claims she can interpret the results, such as

there is learning about about the competencies.

So so she her interpretation people had prejudice against female

politician.

They couldn't do their job.

But once they see them doing their job then you

know it changes.

And therefore more women are elected and are allowed to

run by the can as candidates, by the by the

parties because they also.

So that's a sort of optimistic message.

It's also this is a follow up to that.

The flow on paper.

Um, I mean, the first one was just looking at

an election where a certain share of, uh, of the

village chiefs were required to be women, and that was

randomly determined.

So it's a beautiful design for writing a paper about

it, but then they, they look at, uh, subsequent elections

and, uh, it turned out that that, uh, is Laurie

Beeman.

That's the the flaw at all.

Uh, points out that among the villages, there are many

villages in India that, uh, had been allotted female Labour

by quota in election X, there were more than one

candidate for for village in an election.

X plus one.

Which kind of is similar could be interpreted as, you

know, demonstration effect.

Runs counter to to pre-existing prejudice.

Yes.

I was wondering like.

This connects to your previous paper in the sense that

the one we saw last week that.

So now it seems like the standard, assuming that is

having the standards of the political or the officers are

higher.

Right.

Like so.

Now, if you the plots from last time, I would

assume like the, the IQ and all these measures would

be higher in terms of the politicians.

Right.

So I don't know if that's like another effect of

this, like just increasing the.

One.

Person partial effect that the that would uh, uh, be

that.

Because we.

Haven't there is um, you know, we were a little

Mickey In this, the research program.

I've told you about four stations on it.

So in that we had only only we had data

from 1982 to 2014.

So that's 30 years.

Uh, now, we uh, last at the end of last

year, we updated the data set.

So now we have data that goes to 2022.

Uh, so ten more years forward.

And then we have data that goes back to, um,

the early 1970s.

So that's ten, ten more years.

Backwards as well.

So that happens to be, you know, there was a

which, you know, maybe, uh, it was the beginning of

the 70s is the beginning of, of the one chamber

Parliament before we had a two chamber Parliament.

So.

So this political regime change anyway.

So it's everything in terms of national politics after that.

And then there was a municipal reform where um 800

municipalities became uh, 290.

So we have everything from the new municipality composition.

So the so then 50 years, it, you know, it

becomes a little bit more plausible to think about change

in political selection for 30 years.

If you elections in particular, if there are reforms like

the, the one we study here, the late in that

period, you know, we don't have too much to write

home about.

But I think with this 50 years worth of data,

it's the same thing connected to.

The.

To register support.

For all.

Of the socio demographics.

And so on.

Then one can start to.

Think seriously about.

You know, whether political selection factors have been changing.

And I think these are interesting questions, the kind of,

uh, many people seem to have very strong priors.

They say opposite to, you know, politicians are better before,

uh, you know, more competent.

Um, that's a that's a reputable position or proposition.

And then I think the more interesting thing is, you

know, to what extent, you know, do the party specific

selection patterns change, if at all, and what happens over

time?

So is it the case that the, you know, party

Wants to push certain questions so it recruit politicians that

are.

Know something about those questions, which probably implies certain occupations

and certain levels of competence, etc..

Or is it the other way around that the party

has a slate of candidates by historical accident, or some?

They are interested in certain questions, so they start pushing

those questions, probably a feedback process where you know, you

have two way interactions, but uh, still, uh, it's a

rich, rich world and with, uh, lots of lots of

data, but.

Perhaps something about.

So that's the.

Next step in this.

Research program, as I see.

Nothing to report.

That yet.

Maybe two years.

Down the line.

It's good.

Yeah.

I guess about last week, uh, when you presented about

the competence of politicians.

I was wondering if there's similar studies in other countries

where because it felt that maybe the fact that in

Sweden, most politicians, they don't do that as their main

job.

So it feels like maybe there's a bit of an

effect where it's something that those individuals that would really

have an incentive in a way or an interest to

do that.

And so they have also the like the cognitive abilities

to take out that sort of action.

And I'm wondering if in countries or in, at election

levels in which being politician really is a job, if

we would still see that effect or not.

Yeah, I think we see it in the, in the,

in the national parliament.

They are the most competent according to our measures.

Right.

That's the.

Standard.

The graphs.

Of the.

In the first paper, I talked about who becomes a

politician.

That's, uh, that's a fact.

But, um.

Yeah, I mean, it seems that these politicians are an

oxymoron of sorts, but it's quite common.

Uh, you know, certainly the the Nordic countries have that.

Uh, that that's true.

Maybe it's a Scandinavian thing, but, uh, you know, even

say if you go to the US, uh, it's true

that people in Congress, it's a full time job that

people in the, in the, in the state Congresses, uh,

they only have typically a few months of politics.

It's a part time.

Job.

Where there is some remuneration, but it's not a full

time.

So I think it's more common than one would think.

Uh uh, and yes, there are typically full time politicians

in Italian.

There would be full time on the job, but, you

know, there would be a council of.

Some.

People to do some.

But you're right that, uh, that there are.

Perhaps the sort of the view of politicians matter for

who want to become a politician.

People are intrinsically motivated to a large degree, which I

argued is the only way to make sense of the

of of the data where people are standing more competent

than, uh, than the average population, even if the party

doesn't have.

A chance of.

Winning the election.

Yeah.

Get these, uh, get these, uh.

Pecuniary remunerations.

So if people are socially motivated or intrinsically motivated, uh,

you want to call it then supposedly depends on, on

how society looks upon, uh, a politician.

And that's, uh.

That's a job that is worth doing.

Or whether people look upon politicians as a bunch of

scoundrels, as would be the case in, in some corrupt.

Societies.

So.

You know, the there may be, uh, multiple equilibria kind

of in the, in the, the social return to being

a politician that has to do with how well the,

the system is, is working.

And that.

May.

Go into different corners.

History.

Circumstance.

I'm not trying to suggest that what I.

What I've shown you is, has external validity in all

political.

Systems.

At all times.

That would, uh.

Um, it would be hard to claims.

So anything I'm here for question.

Uh, but then when he stated that in order to

to investigate that question, data is not equally available.

Across across societies.

Okay.

Very good.

So, uh, next week, Elliot will be here, and, uh,

you will let her know if you change your mind

about the timing of.

This board report.

Thanks.

People.

Like to the station and see you inside.

Thank you sir.

Yeah, thank you very much.

Yeah.

Thank you.

Thanks.

Okay.

Do something.

Yes.

Um.

It's maybe a big.

One in the hospital.

Go ahead.

What do you think?

What do you think?

Like the difference.

I think.

Yeah, I think, um.

I think we saw.

That, um, the first line was more about internal.

Political questions.

Uh.

So that economists would be less interested in.

So it was the first submission.

So, uh, we never tried, uh, another one.

But yeah, the second one was, was I see uh.

That was actually true for all these four papers.

So, um, but yeah.

I think the.

So sorry, I don't know whether it's a counterfactual.

Yeah, but it's more like, uh, you know, interest that

you expect like from because.

Uh, have, you know, people talk about it in finance.

Yeah.

Because, yeah, maybe the market conditions.

Yeah.

So maybe the price.

Has broader.

Load.

But it is a bit.

Yeah.

Right.

In fact based.

On political economics.

Is.

Um.

It's sometimes.

People think about it as a narrow field.

Uh, I'm not sure.

Uh, you know, Francesco Tremblay, who is, uh, uh.

Is not working these days.

He likes.

To.

He's heading the NBR.

Uh, program on economics.

He likes to.

Have the.

Field.

Uh, so he computed.

The share.

Of top.

Five.

Publications.

Uh, all the five publications that are in the field

of the reasonable definition sort of hovers around 60%.

Mhm.

Yeah.

So, you know, not sure.

It's, uh, a narrow field.

But uh, still many.

There are some people in that.

Profession, I would say.

Just.

Yeah.

Like like I've been interested in, like, convicts or so-called

like, so like the political is making its interaction with

like economics stuff, but like, if I can't say speak

a lot of things to that, like economic connections, I

feel like this may be a political science result or.

Yeah.

Well, I but I think.

That's a bit destructive.

Right.

Because so sometimes, you know, um, one can I'm not

saying it happens.

And certainly, you know, I've been moderately successful in, in,

in pushing these ideas at, uh, at the boundary between

subfields.

Um, but, you know, one runs the.

Risk that, uh.

Suppose we're considering a field, uh, Perspective about the boundary

between sociology and economics and.

And economists who say, well, that's just sociology.

Those questions.

And then sociology.

That's economics.

I mean, economics does exist, but so so then, you

know, that means that certain questions that are on the

boundary and are, uh, don't get investigated.

And sometimes they are the most interesting ones because few.

People thought it.

So I think the best two sides.

What are you working on?

I don't know yet.

Yeah.

I'm still, like, thinking they're thinking about, like, what I

should work on.

You don't have an advisor yet?

I do have an advisor.

Well, like, I'm still thinking about it.

I need to come up with a better concrete idea.

Paper.

Yeah, like I like.

I like how other like trade or spatial equilibrium or

other typical like friction.

Now that's been like studied well in development studies related

to like political interactions or like.

For example, how like why democracy is not working well

in certain countries, like two countries.

But some answers may be obvious for someone.

I'm trying to look looking for important and interesting puzzle

and that kind of interact into sections.

But I'm still yeah, I'm very working.

I tried to work hard, but.

Yeah, like I just couldn't.

Okay, good.

Yeah.

In all likelihood, I'll be here next fall.

I'm here every fall.

So, uh, every fall since 1999.

So, yeah, like.

Seven.

Weeks.

From.

Here, like.

I see.

So, yeah, I might be sending some email to ask.

I was.

Coming from.

I see me in the office or something.

Yeah.

Thank you very.

Much.

Yeah.

I think we didn't forget.

Mm.

Mm mm.

Mm mm.

Mm.

Oh, yeah.

Good afternoon.

All right.

How are you?

All right.

Thank you.

You too.

Oh.

Greeting weeks next week, isn't it?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Okay.

Oh.

Hello.

There you are.

All right, guys.

Hey.

Good afternoon.

And.

Lecture 6:

Passenger.

Uh.

Look at that.

I was told that.

Too much day to day.

No risk of this.

Or rather, my model is untestable.

Okay, so we've shrunk a bit from the first lecture

that the standard now or no, this is unusual.

Okay.

Um.

Okay.

So if if you remember how how I started, I

sort of motivated the fact that we need to think

about institutions and.

And typically think about institutions as either allowing us to

aggregate preferences.

Or to aggregate information.

But this this goes back to more generally thinking about

you know what individuals in society want.

And we think that there may be elements that are

sort of hardwired into preferences, and there may be elements

that depends on some state of nature.

And so we may have, for example, in the case

of even common values, let's say all of us want

the same thing.

There may be different information held by different people.

And so we would like institutions to also properly aggregate

the information among voters and the laws of nature the

correct choice.

And if we think of the most basic institution, you

know, we thought a little bit about some form of

an election.

Uh, when we talked about the median voter results, national

referendum, potentially, these are sort of similar or similar in

the environment, the very basic environment that I discussed.

Oops, of the dance model, um, or the citizen candidate

model.

So we had a very basic election mechanism or a

friend to mechanism that aggregated preferences.

We didn't think about information okay.

And I'm going to continue with preference aggregation for today

the duration of today and and next week please.

And the two types of institutions that I am going

to analyse is today I'm going to talk about interest

groups.

And next week.

So one way to think about you know, to think

about uh, sort of somehow aggregating different preferences in the

policy is, you know, to think about, okay, so we

start with lots of individuals, but it's very complex to

how to aggregate all these preferences.

So you think about creating some coalitions that may be

bargain among the price.

You can think about interest groups as entities that form

of individuals that are relatively similar.

Right.

So, you know, everyone in the oil industry firms and

of course, maybe they have some different preferences, but they

have a strong similarity of of the most important thing

to them.

Okay.

So you can think about sort of the next stage

instead of individuals trying to reach an outcome among themselves,

we have some interest groups that somehow takes, uh, some

possible action in the political game, which we have to

specify.

Okay.

Um, and maybe the next stage of creating coalitions is,

you know, several of these forming parties to party together.

Okay.

Then we have sort of, you know, bigger groups in

society trying to reach an agreement.

And maybe when we have parliamentary elections.

Different parties form a coalition coalition of government.

So we have some sort of process in which we

form larger and larger groups that represent.

So the groups may not be larger, but they represent

larger and larger coalitions of voters.

Okay.

So if you think the coalition or government may represent,

you know, a large bulk, uh, of other small coalitions

that at the end of the day represent a large,

a large section of the voters.

Okay.

And I think these two types of institutions are particularly

interesting because, um, you know, it's a bit similar to

when we think about the boundaries of the firm economics.

Right.

Uh, so how do we move from having an interest

group to having a party?

What can a party do that is different from an

interest group?

An interest group can stay outside of the formal political

system and pressure parties in the inside.

Or if you think about the evolution of the Green

Party, started as a clear interest group in the sense

of, you know, we have particular interest of the environment.

So they were pressure groups and then they found the

party at the end.

So how do you make this decision to stay an

interest group and only pressure from the outside or to

form a party and, you know, be part of the

official, official system?

Okay.

So these are all sort of a bunch of general

questions which we are not going to answer.

And I think there aren't very good answers to these

questions in the literature, specifically this question of, you know,

how do you move from any group to a party?

So maybe after next week when we talk about parties,

you can discuss this further.

Okay.

So today I'm going to talk about the main.

So the main part of the the preference aggregation part

of how interest groups pressures, uh, or how interest groups

interfere in the in the what may seem to be

a fair representation of pressure intimidation.

Okay.

So so in the literature, there are sort of two

main methods of influence for interest groups.

One is that what interest interest groups do is essentially

influence either the vote of part of the population or

the decision making, or the agenda set up by the

British.

Okay, which is what we're going to focus on today.

Okay.

So somehow, you know, they they get more power in

the preference aggregation.

And that's the mechanism that we're going to look okay.

They have the tools to get more power in the

preference in the preference aggregation process.

Pressure politicians.

Okay.

The second way that interest groups sometimes, uh.

Exert influence is, is going to be in the information

aggregation part, which we may talk about later on.

And that includes providing information to politicians or providing information

to the public about politicians or about what is the

right course of action.

Okay.

The information may be biased in some way.

And of course, you know, of course they have an

agenda in the background, but it is a way, another

way to influence the political process.

Um, just the fact that sometimes they have better access

to politicians, okay, which could be illegal, could result from,

you know, many campaign contributions.

So this access allows them to give information to decision

makers in a way that standard members of the public

are not able to do.

And.

Okay.

So.

Okay.

So the old papers in the literature sort of back

in 1993 and dialogue.

Um, so the idea of the paper, I'm not going

to discuss these papers in length, but there are sort

of older ideas we're looking at, you know.

How is it efficient that interest groups interfere in the

process?

Okay.

Uh, the idea of dialogue was, you know, what what

essentially interest groups do is fight, okay?

And the one that pays more wins the fight, and

the politician will do what the interest is doing.

So what, you know, fighting for extracting rent.

And he's a.

His.

Claim was that this is an inefficient process.

Because if you imagine if none of us is fighting,

it may be very similar to all of us are

fighting.

Okay.

We may get the same policy and we're just spending

resources in a non-productive manner.

Okay.

Becker, obviously from Chicago, everything is efficient.

Uh, so his idea was to say, look, when interest

groups are pressuring a politician, um, they have to take

into consideration that if they want a politician to change

her policy, okay, they are moving her from something which

may be, you know, uh, very good for her or

the public.

Uh, so they need to take into consideration, uh, reduction

in an efficiency of policies.

Right?

So maybe they don't want to.

Maybe it's too costly to move the politician from one

policy to the other.

And that means that the interest groups actually take some

efficiency considerations into, into, uh, when does decide what type

of pressure to exert.

Okay.

So we're going to actually model all of these ideas

in a much more.

So all of these were sort of ad hoc types

of ideas.

We're going to have a more proper model in which

some of these ideas will take form.

So if it's not you're not clear.

Now don't don't worry about this because it's not even

clear in this paper.

Okay.

So we want to delve into the actual process in

which individuals can exert pressure on politicians Okay.

We want to.

To try and model this.

And we want to try and understand the nitty gritty

details of such process.

At the end of the day, what is such process?

You know, we're going to think about lobbies and interest

groups paying money or exerting efforts that the politician enjoys.

Okay, so the politician is getting something in return to

affecting her policy.

Okay.

I mean, the true word which we should use in

this context is corruption, right?

Because it's actually not allowed in most countries that, you

know, you pay a politician whether it's in time or

anymore, you know, actual money, uh, to change your policy.

Right.

Um.

So, yeah, we should keep that in mind.

So we are analysing it in a very neutral way,

but it's really not.

Something is allowed in contradiction.

Okay.

So uh, the first part today is going to be

quite theoretical.

Uh, but then we would apply to sort of an

economic environment.

And the paper that is being used is called Common

Agency with first price menu auctions.

We you should I think you are familiar with principal

agent model.

Right.

We have one principal one agent.

The principal gives a contract today to try and use

her to pick a particular action.

Okay.

So if you think about one interest groups, only one

scope in the economy, uh, and others that are not

organised in scope.

So what the interest group can do is offer a

contract to the politician and say, if you choose this,

that the money I give you.

Okay.

What's interesting in the context of interest group is to

think about the competition.

So now we're thinking about the common agents.

So one agent is the competition.

And the interest groups are many principles.

Okay.

And.

You know ignore the first price and the auctions.

You will see how it works.

But the key thing is that each of them offers

a contract which is a menu of possibilities.

Right?

For example, they can say, uh, if you know, you're

picking a policy that is very helpful for us, that's

what we are paying you.

If you pick a policy that is very helpful for

the other interest group, that's one.

So that the menu of payments given policies and each

principal is offering that.

Okay.

So we are modelling the competition between the principles for

the action of it.

Okay.

Question before we start.

When you say it's not allowed them.

Yes.

Politics and we do have lobbying.

And that's legal.

And that was very simple.

So is that what we excluded from that.

So we we have lobbying.

Uh, and there are a lot of regulations are supposed

to protect us from this time.

And I think the key issue is that it's very

difficult to prove that a politician is doing something as

a favour to people.

Right.

So in the US, you have I mean, in the

elections that we had this week, for example, Trump said

very clearly to the oil industry.

If you give me.

$1 billion, I will approve three more trades for you.

Okay.

So that's a very clear, you know.

Right.

Prosecuting Trump would not be successful so far.

But uh, but uh, so for example, in the US

you can't um, they have all this political action group

as a facade for, for this type of particular activity.

Uh, and I think the key thing is that it's

not possible to group.

It's very difficult to do better.

Why are you taking this policy and not the other?

Because you can always say that's the right words.

But I do find it strange that in the papers

that apply this literature that we will discuss later in

the second part of the lecture, I mean, if this

if the application was about something that happens in a

third world country, they call it corruption.

When we think about lobbying in the Western world, it

is just the common agency in the first place.

Okay.

Yeah.

Okay.

Okay.

This is the model.

Okay.

So just three lines.

So let's go through them and then unpack the assumptions.

Uh, the assumptions in this.

So we have n lobbies.

And there is there are two stages.

In the first stage these lobbies simultaneously offer this menu.

Uh the menu specifies a contribution.

So it's a contribution schedule.

It's a contribution.

That lobby pays for each policy P okay.

The contribution cannot be negative.

And.

But it's a function, okay?

It's a function.

It's not just, you know, I want you to do

this.

And you.

I mean, also function.

I pay zero for everything besides a policy, but we're

looking in general, it's a function.

Okay.

And then in the second stage, given this observed contribution

schedule, the politician, the agent has the discretion to choose

the policy.

And she maximises her utility.

And her utility is composed of two paths.

So this is the utility from the policy and from

the contributions that you would get if she implements a

particular policy.

So a is just a parameter of the utility function.

WP is the intrinsic utility of the politician from policy

to okay.

Typically we want to think about a politician that is

benevolent or So WP the degree.

Of course WP is the welfare of the country.

That's a that's the idea that we have in mind.

We want to see how, you know, if there would

be no contributions a politician would actually get preference from

properly so to maximise the welfare of the party.

So how do interests move us from this first best

potential we can achieve?

Okay, so the the politician enjoys the welfare of the

public and uh, and the contribution.

Okay.

And the utility of each lobby as a function of

what he pays and a policy P so w I

p so I'm using the same notation like welfare.

This is the welfare of pi.

Okay.

So lobby I from this particular policy minus what he

has to pay.

Okay, so as you can see, this is the form

of a principal agent model.

Just we have many principles.

What can we, you know, just three lines of a

model.

What's what can we discuss about this.

So first of all, the number of lobbies here is

fixed.

What is what is a lobby or an interest group

is those that are organised and can offer this particular

schedule.

Okay.

So it's it's interesting as in the way that I

discussed in the introduction, uh, to think about which groups

are going to be organised, right, how difficult it is

to get organised, how difficult it is to get access

and so on.

Okay.

So this is not explained in here.

When we think about this generally we are just taking

is given the set of groups that are organised um

the utility of the politician.

So here it's quasi linear.

A lot of the results that are discussed are more

general than that, but it's just good to have a

simple transferable utility framework.

Right.

So the contributions are just transferred from the lobby student

to the politician.

But a lot of the results hold, in particular the

Bernheim Winston is is more general than quasi linearity.

But the key thing here is that the politician enjoys

some element of, let's say, welfare of the public.

And this contribution.

Okay.

So we have to explain a little bit.

Why does the politician enjoys contribution?

Uh, so one possibility is that she takes the money

to her pocket.

Um, which is possible.

Okay.

Uh, second possibility is that maybe she uses the money

so far in her campaign to attract voters to vote.

So, you know, we sort of maybe have in mind

some micro foundation for how money affects voters in an

election.

So maybe there are some voters that really pay attention

to.

So maybe what I maybe in the background, what I

care about is just being re-elected.

Okay.

And then maybe to be re-elected, maybe some voters or

some parts of the economy understand actually what they do

in terms of policy.

And they are more likely to re-elect me if I

give them a higher welfare or the the policy that

they think is the right policy and some section of

the population are more amenable.

You know, maybe they don't.

So it's a bit of a, uh, maybe condescending view

of some voters.

But, you know, not everyone is informed in the same

way.

And then maybe I can I can affect their opinions

with a lot of money through advertising.

I'm guessing the value of.

The politician is not the some of the WS of

the lobbies.

Right.

That's the right one is the welfare, the other is

just right.

But and we were treating the application.

You can think about the some of the lobbyists, uh,

welfare plus the, some of the welfare of all the

other people that are not organised as well.

Okay.

So the lobbies are part of the economy may be

a very concentrated part of the economy.

But that's why I use the same notation, is that,

you know, if you sign up their welfare, if, for

example, everyone in society is organised in a lobby.

Then the sum of this should equal this in this

particular application.

So.

Okay.

So I think we roughly discussed what's behind these assumptions.

Uh any more questions about it.

Okay.

Before actually writing the equilibrium discussing the equilibrium definition.

So I said we're using quasi linearity for most results.

It's not it's not needed.

Uh, the two important elements here okay, which we didn't

discuss in the previous, I mean, one which we've been

discussing in the previous slide.

There is an assumed commitment ability of the law.

I promise you something.

And when you implement the policy, the politicians trust me

to actually implement.

Which.

So assuming some maybe sequential structure that first the politician

actually implements or announces this policy or take steps to

implement this policy, then there will be pain.

Um.

If it's not allowed legally, how can we enforce such

a commitment?

Right.

Okay.

Uh, so maybe in the background, as usual, we have

maybe some repeat of the game consideration of, you know,

I want to maintain the reputation that I am returning

the favour because otherwise, in the next election, they're not

going to support me.

A lot of politicians are not long lived, so maybe

the reputation is more on the party's, um, side rather

than the short lived politicians.

But also, we've picked a model in which, uh, we're

looking at a model in which what interest groups do

is push or pressure the politician in power.

So the incumbent, uh, there are many of them, of

course.

These are like, you know, chairs of the committees in

Congress.

So but as we know, there are actually a lot

of, a lot of campaign contributions is done, uh, before

the election.

And there are some Organisations that actually donate to both

parties.

Okay.

So it's possible that, you know, actually they don't push

a politician, but they sort of somehow create a mechanism

that the party chooses a politician with the right pressure.

Okay.

So in that sense, maybe it's easier to get this

commitment right.

So if I'm, if I'm donating to a party that,

uh, that, uh, sort of I am somehow my agreement

is with the party that they choose the person that

is most pro guns.

Okay, then I know that I will get to what

I want if I think.

If I have this right.

Okay.

So it's it's in general an issue, okay.

Which we're going to ignore.

Um, so let me now discuss the equilibrium definition.

I think it's a straightforward.

So what is the partition do given whatever menus that

she's getting, she chooses the policy which will be zero

in equilibrium to maximise her utility.

So that's straightforward for the competition okay.

Uh.

So it's straightforward for me as a lobby to know

given what the other schedules, what the other menus are

of the other, uh, lobbies.

And given that I know how the partition will behave,

it's straightforward for me to, um, so it's straightforward to

know what the politician will do, given what all the

others are offering.

So in equilibrium, it cannot be for any lobby I

that I can find another payment schedule.

Okay.

That induces the politician.

So another payment schedule I prime okay.

That is different for my equilibrium contribution schedule.

Sigh.

That will induce the politician to to um choose another

policy.

Prime okay.

So that this other policy P prime will maximise her

new utility, which is composed of what the other lobbies

promise for P prime and what I promise.

Okay.

And by doing that finding this new contribution schedule, I'm

increasing my okay so strictly.

So I cannot find another contribution schedule so that I

would be better, given that I know how the politician

will behave in the second stage.

Huh?

Okay, so you can see there are a lot of

elements.

Maybe you can't, but I'll point to that.

There are a lot of elements of coordination here, okay.

Because we might be in a situation in which for

some reason, let's say there are just two lobbies and

we are very similar.

Okay.

Maybe, you know, the other lobby is promising a lot

of money to some policy, which I don't know why.

Okay.

And given that I would rather, uh, you know, I

would rather promise, you know, something similar, and we exert

a lot of money because to push the politician in

another direction would be very costly for me, given that

the other lobbyist promises.

So we may end up actually with a policy that

we don't really like, but each of us is sort

of reinforcing this in the game.

So there may be lots and lots of equilibria, and

we have to find a way to somehow somehow restrict.

Okay.

So it's a simple model but so abstract that, you

know, it's a bit hard to see what you know,

what's going on here.

Okay.

So here is one key result.

When I say general again it means that it's not

only for quasi linearity okay.

The general result says um, in equilibrium it has to

be that the integrity of the politician.

Okay.

The actual utility of the politician in equilibrium is the

same utility that you would get if lobby I.

And that's true for any I if lobby I doesn't

participate.

Okay so imagine that I am lobby I and I

know that if I'm not in the game.

So I'm not contributing zero for anything.

I'm not in the game.

Given what all the other people are doing, the politician

will maximise her utility with some P.

That's the right hand side.

So this is the utility actual maximum uh, of the

politicians utility.

Okay.

Well if I want to push her to do something

else.

Right, there is no need for me to give the

politician any rent, right?

I can keep her just indifferent.

Or row.

Maybe I give an epsilon.

Okay, so if I want to push her to do

something else.

So P0 okay.

Then I need to give her just enough to keep

her indifferent.

Uh.

Between this and the policy that she would choose without

me.

Okay, so I can identify what the policy that she

would choose without me.

And essentially, for this policy, I should contribute zero, right?

And for the policy that I want her to I

want to move her to, I should, uh, I should

contribute.

Okay.

So that's already gives us some form of characterisation of

what we are looking for.

Maybe we can see graphically.

Okay, let's say that this is the space of policy

P, and in general let's say that the lobbyist wants

as high as possible okay.

This is the contribution of a particular lobby.

Or this is the contribution to the, let's say the

size of the contribution of the government.

It's just the utility for money.

So let's say that there is a policy P such

that if I pay zero okay, the indifference curve of

the government of the politician maybe looks like that.

Okay.

So that would be the given the contribution of everyone

else.

Okay.

This would be when I contribute zero.

This is the policy that the government would choose.

Okay.

And the more I country you know, the more I

contribute and the policy of the government shifts.

Okay, then the government remains indifferent along this indifference curve

because they move away from what they were planning to

do.

Okay.

So it's not ideal for them, but I'm giving them

money, so I will do this a long distance.

You can think about this also in the case of

I'm just I'm the only lobby.

Okay.

Just on this graph, let's say I'm the only lobby.

This is the ideal policy that maximises WP.

If I want to move the government away from this

to keep them on the same utility, I have to

pay them.

I have to pay them.

Okay.

Think about this.

Just as the contribution of lobbying.

Okay.

But in the background of this, you can think of

contributions of other lobbyists.

That's what the government will choose.

And in this indifference curve, they will also take into

consideration what other lobbyists are giving them when they move

away from it.

But of course, I need to give them more if

I move them.

Okay.

So essentially what this result is saying is that, you

know, I need to keep the government on this indifference

curve, right?

So I can choose.

So my I can choose the highest indifference curve.

So I like a higher P.

But I also like to pay very little.

Right.

So my indifference curve looks something like this.

That's the highest utility.

Maybe that's the highest paid possible okay.

That's the highest utility.

I think if I get a high P and no

money.

Okay.

So my indifference curve looks something like this.

And then I want to be on the highest indifference

curve.

Such is the government indifference.

Okay, this is for everything.

Is contributions a nice friendship.

Like Aspen Middle School with multiple lobbies that probably won't

think differentiable because you might get junctures, you know.

Absolutely, yes.

Okay.

But this just to make the point that using this

to make the point that I'm going to pick a

policy, okay.

And the contribution so that I keep the government or

in other words, there actually must be another policy that

I'm contributing.

Zero.

And this particular policy is the policy that maximises the

utility of the government.

And the reason why in that different scope of the

government is because the policy, the policy is the fact

that as the reason we're.

The policy.

Is the policy is defined already, like, why are we

not moving the difference with the government?

Okay.

So so what I'm doing is I'm taking this given

what happens without.

Okay.

So of course there may be other indifference curves of

the government.

Right.

This is much nicer for them.

Right.

For each policy they're getting more money okay.

So this is the indifference curve of the government that

happens that this is what the government is getting without

me.

Okay?

I don't want to pick something higher than that.

I don't need to Epsilon.

Right.

Okay.

I can't make them choose anything, you know, below this

region.

So my best response.

So we are in an equilibrium.

If.

Okay.

If, uh, I give the government the same utility that

she gets without me.

Meaning that actually there is a policy that I'm always

contributing to.

So an actual actual contribution schedule can be, you know,

maybe I'm donating zero for all these policies.

Okay.

And starting here I'm following this curve.

That's one possibility okay.

Which so maybe nicely behaved.

Maybe not.

Maybe I'm contributing, you know, zero all the way up

to this point.

I'm jumping and I give this okay.

And you know, again, zero later.

Okay.

There are many ways to create.

That.

But we found this point by looking at the, at

the, you know, nice and smooth.

The indifference curve is always there.

Maybe the contribution schedule is not differentiable, but the indifference

curve is always right.

It's just an indifference curve.

Okay.

So the fact that I'm at the tangency of the

two indifference curves tells me something, right?

It tells me that I cannot improve the utility of

both the lobby and the government.

Right?

Okay, so the contribution, the actual policy that is implemented.

Okay.

And together with the contribution function of the lobby, okay,

is such that we are going to be at this

point, meaning that there is no other point here in

this space that can improve the utility of both the

politician.

Okay.

And that's that's, uh.

That gives us some idea of the efficiency.

Potential efficiency, please.

There is for each lobby.

Okay.

So that's the second point here for each lobby, I

the policy that is chosen maximises the joint utility of

the Politician and the lobby.

For each look.

Okay.

Still looks pretty abstract in the sense of how we're

actually going to find these policies and these contribution schedules.

Okay.

And it looks like a miracle that each lobby maximises

the joint welfare of of themselves and the politicians.

Each lobby does it.

Okay.

So we have a lot of conditions right, for each

lobby.

You know this, but we also have a lot of,

you know, a lot of variables to solve because we

have the contribution schedule for for many, many policies.

And we still, you know, there may be very, you

know, there's so many functions that could be contribution schedules.

So how do we get how do we get all

the.

Okay, but that's the first step.

And we'll soon see how we how we can use

it.

Um, so there is a proof of that.

I think it's pretty straightforward, right?

Because if you think about this, I mean, first, you

can see it in the, in the graph.

But if you think about this.

If there is another policy, okay, that if the current

policy doesn't I'm lobby.

I just think about one movie.

If there is another policy that maximises our joint welfare,

I can somehow tweak my contribution schedule, make sure that

the politician chooses this policy in a way that keeps

the politician in different right compared to P0.

And what does it mean?

It means that I'm grabbing the surplus, the surplus.

Right.

So this is the joint surplus of me and the

politician.

If there is another policy that maximises the joint surplus

and it's not what the politician is choosing, I should

tweak my contribution schedule given what the other people are

doing.

Keep the politician indifferent to P0 and I can grab.

The next.

Recipients.

Okay.

Okay, so all of these really just come from the

equilibrium, uh, definition.

And here I'm using transferable.

Okay.

Okay.

So there is a proof here of just this statement

that just relies on the equilibrium condition.

Uh, I don't think it's too interesting.

Okay.

This joint efficiency result has reminiscent of the group's Clark

mechanism.

Right.

Because what am I doing is a lobby.

I'm paying to change the outcome that exists without.

Okay, so I'm paying the externalities.

I'm imposing.

Imposing on her.

Okay.

The next step is to try and narrow down the

the set of equilibria that we're looking at.

Um.

Okay.

And.

Imagine that the lobby does use, you know, this blue

curve that I described.

Okay.

So here gives a differentiable contribution schedule.

So looking at this indifference curves allowed us to see

the efficiency, the joint efficiency, but it also gives us

some property of what we could call local truthfulness.

Okay, this contribution schedule here keeps me on the same.

Whenever I contribute something positive, it keeps me on the

same indifference curve as the log, which essentially says that

my contribution is truthful.

Okay.

Locally here, locally here.

But at least here it's local truthfulness in the sense

that if I change a little bit my contribution, it

reflects exactly the difference in utility that I get.

Okay, so essentially I'm kept on the same utility level

here because any contribution change reflects exactly my utility change.

Okay.

So the blue curve is actually it's not only locally

truthful, it's globally truth, okay.

In the sense that whenever I contribute something positive that's

the utility blanket okay.

So when we say truthful we just mean that anything

that we're getting out of it is going straight to

the politician.

Right.

But so I'm being guaranteed a particular level of utility.

Right.

Which can be very high.

Okay.

I'm guaranteed a particular level of utility.

And no matter what the politician chooses, whenever I say

something positive, I get this level of utility.

Okay, that's exactly the definition here.

Sorry.

It should be w here and not the V, okay,

so any V was the total utility which was a

function of w and c okay.

So any changes in the contribution reflect changes in my

w I.

V was w minus c so I'm keeping the v

fixed.

Okay so changes in C are reflected are a reflection

of the change in the utility that I get is

that since it's truthful whenever I pay something positive okay.

But those related with.

The differentiability of the contribution schedule.

Differentiability tells us that if it's differentiable, it has to

be at least locally truthful.

Okay.

But we're going to continue with that.

And actually we're going to assume global truthfulness, which is

that whenever you pay something positive.

It's it's right.

Yes.

Are we so, for example, let's say we do this

case right.

We were originally the people now.

Yes.

Can we see that as efficient or still that is

still efficient.

It's inefficient.

Right.

I mean joint efficiency.

Joint efficiency.

But for each lobby and for the politicians okay.

That's the definition.

That's the efficiency.

Consideration.

Maybe not for the population, but at least for this.

So we're not thinking about the population at all okay.

And total efficiency here is what maximises the joint utility

of all the lobbies.

And the correlation that will be the definition of total

of parameter efficient.

Okay.

So what we're going to do is you know we

have this problem.

It's still pretty tricky and there may be lots of

equilibria.

So what we're going to do is we're going to

assume that we'll be using this globally truthful strategy.

We're going to focus on equilibria in which the lobbies

are using these truthful strategies.

Whenever we want to refine a set of equilibria we

have to justify it somehow.

Okay.

And so you will you know, you may ask why?

I mean, here the word truthful is not, uh, it's

not normative sense.

It's just saying that the contribution schedule reflects some, uh,

the, the welfare consideration of the lobby.

And, but, you know, it can still be that the

lobbies are gaining a lot.

Um.

Okay, so here is the.

So there are several justifications for why we're using tools

for strategy.

First of all.

No matter if others are using tools for strategy or

not, it's always in my set of best response.

And you can you can clearly see it here.

Right?

This red curve could come from whatever other lobbies are

doing.

Okay.

And I can always you know I know I want

to implement this point.

I can always use the tools for strategy okay.

So that's one justification.

The second justification is it'd be nicer.

And we're going to prove this one.

An equilibrium in truthful strategy is pretty efficient, maximising not

only the individual lobby plus the politician involved, but the

total welfare of all the players that we have here.

Again, the public is not there.

So we don't think about.

Okay.

And this is true in general.

This is not about quasi linearity or transferability.

Okay.

So our morning brain exercise is to prove this.

I think it's it's it's a it's a nice proof.

Okay.

So how do we prove that the equilibrium is Efficient.

What we're going to say is that, you know, assume

by way of contradiction that it is not very confusion.

Okay.

So remember we denoted our equilibrium by P0 and the

contribution schedules c0 okay.

So if it is not Pareto efficient it means that

there is another p star policy okay.

And some payment vector system that each lobby contributes for

p star that Pareto dominates the equilibrium outcome.

And we are taking as given that the equilibrium outcomes

are truthful okay.

Because we are saying we want to show that the

equilibrium enforcement strategy is efficient.

So we assume it's not.

So we take as given that these are truthful.

So p zero and c zero are truthful.

That means that the utility of the lobby okay is.

Do they contribute something?

Okay.

Is always some number.

Okay.

This was by before.

Now it's.

Sometimes it's you hear.

Sometimes it's v okay.

So it's a number which is fixed okay.

So that's what we're starting.

P0 c0 c0 or truthful.

So that the lobby's utility is fixed at some at

some level.

But there is p star and c started gives a

higher joint utility.

What does it mean.

It means that the utility of everyone, the politician and

the lobbies, are at least as high.

And the p star and system compared to what we

have in equilibrium with at least one inequality.

Either the politician is better off here or one of

the lobbies.

So that's our contradiction assumption.

That's already half of the proof.

Just to set this down, term.

I mean, assuming that the ANC are very compact spaces.

Let's let's assume that I'm actually not sure that we

mean.

Okay.

I mean, we assume that a maximum exists.

Okay.

So let's assume whatever we need to assume.

Okay.

Okay.

So we're going to use the fact that we know

that we know two things besides the fact that people

maximise their utility.

We know that p star C star Pareto dominates the

equilibrium outcome.

And we know that according to our contradiction assumption.

And we know that the original strategies and truthful okay.

So by these two.

I can say that for all lobbies Okay.

It has to be that this star contributions are less

or equal then what they contribute in equilibrium for p

star.

Okay.

So remember the equilibrium outcome is P0.

But you give a contribution schedule.

Okay.

The first claim is that what I give in equilibrium

what the law of is given equilibrium for p star

has to be higher.

Than actually what they give to this parameter.

Dominant.

Okay.

Let me try and remember why I'm saying that.

Um.

Okay.

Okay.

Assume that it's wrong.

So c j star is greater than for some j.

What they pay for B star which guarantees under B

star and under this payment.

Okay.

What do they pay?

I know what they pay.

I know that they pay exactly to get the same

utility that they get in equilibrium because the contribution is

scheduled.

So they get some U0V0.

Okay.

So that's the parameter that that determines the utility.

So suppose they pay more okay.

So this parameter dominant and what they they specify in

the menu for the same policy.

But this must mean that.

What they get out of this supposedly correct the dominant

outcome is less than what they get.

And equilibrium.

Peace.

Okay.

It means that it's less.

Let's do the first step.

It means that it's less than what they would get

if the politician would adopt p star under the equilibrium

contributions.

Right.

Because it's the same policy.

Okay.

And here I'm paying more.

Okay.

But this is equal exactly to what the J is

getting because of truthfulness under the equilibrium.

Position.

Okay.

So this is truthfulness.

Okay.

Assuming that for this p star, I'm actually planning something.

Okay.

This is truthfulness.

And this I'm just using the.

Fact.

That I said, well, I mean, just getting a hold

now on what type of contributions we have.

Okay.

It has to be that if this system is for

it, it has to be that the lobbyists are all

the lobbyists contribute less than what they pay in equilibrium

for this.

So if this is true, then we reach this, which

is a contradiction to our original assumption that the piston

system is operated on.

Truthfulness.

We learn something about the payment schedule.

Okay.

First step.

Second step.

Given what I learned now, I learned that it cannot

be that it's the politician that is strictly better off

in the spirit of dominance.

Right?

It can be either the politician or one of the

lobbyists.

What I'm learning is that it cannot be that the

utility.

Okay.

So we cannot have the case that the utility of

the politician is strictly higher than what she gets, uh,

in the equilibrium.

Why is that?

Imagine again that it's strictly higher.

Okay.

What I've learned from the opposite of this, okay, is

actually that the utility of the partition and the p

star and.

The equilibrium contributions.

Is at least as high as this.

Right.

Because this is the same policy and the lobbies, what

we've learned is that the lobbyists contribute to this.

They're more in equilibrium than in the dominant.

Okay.

So it must mean that if it must mean that

this relationship must hold for the politician.

So if I'm assuming that it's strictly better off under

this system, I realised that actually we were not included.

So she was not best responding okay.

So if this.

Give it.

Okay.

That actually we proved here that this relationship holds.

Then we would contradiction to the assumption of liberal.

And what do we learn from all of this.

We learn that it is not the politician that is

better off.

So the the utility of the politician must be strictly

equal.

To her utility in an equilibrium.

This is the dominant.

And it's one of the lobbies that is has to

be strictly better off in the presence of dominant one.

Given that, we assume that such exists.

Okay, so the existing lobby that I'm the star and

sister is doing better of them.

Okay, that was the hard part.

Now it's easy to see what the lobby can do

to deviate from the equilibrium and increase her utility.

Okay.

What the lobby can do is say.

Okay.

Given what everyone else is doing, I'm not controlling that.

It's all zero for the other lobbies instead of my

C zero.

What I'm telling the agent now.

Okay, now I don't have to use a truthful strategy

because I'm deviating so I can tell the agent, hey,

look, I'm going to offer you sister, little sister.

And I want you to choose P star.

And I'm going to guarantee you that you're going to

get something which is better than what you get now.

Okay.

Go get something which is better than what it is

now.

Why?

Okay.

Why?

Because for star, I'm giving you my little sister.

But all the other lobbies are giving you something which

is at least as high.

Okay, so your Reactivity.

So this to my own sister I okay and everyone

else C0J or minus I or j.

Okay.

This is at least as high as what you're getting

here.

So you're willing to do that.

Okay.

Maybe I throw in an epsilon.

Okay.

So you're willing to do that because you're getting something

which is higher than this.

Which is equal to what.

Okay.

And I'm better off because I'm I'm getting p star.

Psi star I and I'm remember, I'm strictly better off

on the list than.

Okay, so, um, there's some really mild conditions.

We didn't use quasi linearity.

Under some mild conditions, we found a way to restrict

the equilibrium behaviour that gives us Pareto efficiency.

So remember in the beginning I said look, we have

many equilibrium.

There might be a lot of mis coordination here.

We sort of blocked all this missed coordination.

We are on the frontier of parity efficiency for the

for the lowest and the okay.

Okay.

So we this this is the fact that it's always

a best response.

And the fact that this is a period of efficient

equilibrium, typically in sort of applications when you have a

lot of equilibrium focusing on apparatus efficient one is a

justification to to focus on a particular type of behaviour.

With quasi linearity also the reverse, all that any efficient

outcome is an efficient outcome can be created in equilibrium

with two things.

Right?

Okay.

Fine.

But what do we want to do okay.

So I've given you this.

It's a nice way to to see how Pareto efficiency,

truthfulness, all of these works together and to understand the

I think, the importance of truthfulness in the sense, you

know, how we use it here.

Okay.

We're still.

It's all very nice, but how does it help us

to find the equilibrium?

Okay.

Okay.

And this is the key result.

And now I'm assuming quasi linearity.

We have now very simple way to find the equilibrium

policy.

We then have to characterise what contributions we have and

so on.

But at least there is a super simple way to

characterise the equilibrium policy.

And the equilibrium policy must maximise the actual welfare of

the lobbyist, the joint welfare of the lobbyist and.

The politician and the public.

If you want.

Okay.

In this way.

Okay.

First, where is it coming from?

Remember that this policy maximises the utility of the politician,

which is composed of the second part, AWP plus the

contribution.

Okay.

But the contributions.

Right.

So the equilibrium policy must be such that maximises the

utility of the partition, which is what we have here

compared to any other point.

Okay.

But the contributions reflect exactly the welfare of the politicians.

Right.

Any change, any difference in the contributions?

Again, for those that are positive, it is enough for

us to look at.

Okay.

Okay.

So if if instead of cjp zero minus cjp you

put W00 minus w, did you get that?

So if you use crazy.

If you use in reality.

Yeah.

So say you have like a lobby with uh, utility,

but.

With differentiability you will still get, uh, local truthfulness, which

will allow you to use.

Okay.

But that just gives you that you have a trivial

strategy that gives you a.

Local condition for same applies.

Okay.

If you had like max P.s.i minus max B minus

psi.

So like you want to be on the left hand

corner And then.

Then you can see efficiency.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yes.

Efficiency of true system.

Yeah I showed the truth.

Okay.

So this is really cool in the sense that, you

know, we don't need to ask ourselves, what are these

all complicated schedules, right.

We first we can figure out which is the first

priority.

Maybe we could figure out the policy.

Okay.

From the policy, we can now back the contribution schedule.

Right.

Which is, you know, it's going to be more complicated

when we have more lobbies and so on.

Okay.

But, you know, when we do the economic example, we

will you know, it will be you could see that

it's going to be relatively easy to figure this out.

The key thing is that we know how to how

to.

Find.

The police.

And also it gives us some interpretation for the role

of the interest groups.

Right.

Because if we do interpret the welfare of the family,

and going back to your initial point, if we think

that the son of the WG is here as well.

Okay, so WP includes the sum of welfare of the

lobbies and the welfare of everyone else, not organised.

Okay.

Essentially the lobbies in the utility function of the politician

that chooses policy, the lobbies get a weight of one

plus a and the rest of the party.

Yes.

Okay.

And that's very, you know, for our application, that's a

very.

Uh.

Not maybe nice is not the right word, but it's

very reasonable.

Um, I mean, you could see.

How was it given to you?

Okay.

Very reasonable interpretation that the lowest gets a higher rate

in the welfare considerations.

Uh, just a very clear, clear and intuitive connection.

Okay, so with this chosen strategies, we found a way

to first easily characterise the equilibrium, uh, policies and a

reasonable interpretation of what is going on here.

What are interest group gaining?

If they get organised they gain higher weight in the

political system.

The preference aggregation.

Preference aggregation is not one person, one vote.

It's uh, once you open it to low influence, you

get a higher, higher weight.

The other benefits to look at the benefit are other

reasons.

Um.

So if you're a more theoretically inclined.

Uh.

Coalition proof.

So when we think about Nash equilibrium, we think about

unitary deviations.

The coalition proof equilibrium thinks about deviations of correlation.

Uh.

So a 290 is also efficient.

For.

The lobbyist, in the sense that no coalition of lobbyists

can get together and decide on each contribution schedule of

of lobbying together so that all of them are going

to be better placed.

Okay.

This concept takes us closer, closer to the concept of

the core, right?

Core is immune to deviations of correlation, but sometimes it

exists on the same problem with corruption.

But in the environment that we're looking at, we're going

to always have a truthful equilibrium.

So.

Because it's not you wouldn't guess it relative to guessing

game after correlation.

Right.

Because it's just it's just spread it out to the

core.

Okay.

I think it's time for a break.

And then we do.

We take this and do an actual economic application and

figure out what the contribution is.

I can discuss more.

Okay.

So 20 minutes.

Yeah.

So back.

Yeah.

Let's do it.

1140.

Okay.

There's a French legend also.

Oh, yeah.

Sure.

I'm so tired.

You're tired?

How come?

I was on the call quite late last night.

Oh.

Where are they?

In America?

No, she's in France.

But she was supposed to call me at 930, and

then whatever she had before got delayed.

And so she called a demon and said, you make

this.

Um.

Yeah.

And then, like, tonight, I'm supposed to call a friend

of mine who's in New Zealand.

And Basil.

In New Zealand.

Oh.

So that's so far ahead that.

You would think that.

But the problem is like.

I mean, I told him that I could call him

at best at eight because I was like, I finished

teaching at seven.

Technically I could starting 720, but usually I go back

to the office to the attendance and everything and then

but the problem is like, if I call him at

eight, it's already 9 a.m. for him.

And it's like, maybe you've already started work by nine.

So I don't know.

It's like he's far ahead, which is convenient, but he's

not is too far ahead.

You see what I mean?

That's a sweet spot.

Like nine, ten hours.

Yeah, exactly like 13.

Like, at the moment it's 13 and it's a bit

too much.

Um.

So.

Yeah.

Um, because then like, also when I worked out, then

it was more like, it's like we're literally missing each

other.

Also, because it's the kind of person who wakes up

at, like, I think he wakes up at 530.

And so I guess he goes to bed at ten

or something like that.

So it's not ideal for, you know.

You gotta call him before you before work.

Okay.

How do you know them?

We did the masters together.

Like, he's, um, funny story about him in the sense

that he's half Italian, half New Zealander.

And so his parents met because his dad was back,

uh, packing through Europe, like, at, like, some sort of,

like, group of people that were backpacking.

And so that's how they met.

And I always find it so funny because, like so

his dad asked that his mom I don't remember how

many times like maybe five times.

And each time she said no or something like this

until she finally gave it.

And I always find it so funny because.

So his mom, she comes from this town and literally

there's like, it's not such a small town, but it's

also like not a big town, you see, like.

And basically like, yeah.

Then she made this New Zealander.

And he.

Brought her back to New Zealand.

And I cannot stop thinking about his grandma, who must

be like my daughter, just like she just like.

Will stay that.

Way.

So.

Okay.

That's okay.

Yeah.

I'm such a sucker for a nice story.

I though.

But anyway, like, uh.

So he always spends Christmas in that period, like in

Europe, in Italy.

So we're going to see each other soon.

But we were supposed to spend New Years together and

then lots of things happened.

Not going to spend years together anymore.

So I'm going to go spend a few days with

him in Philly and.

I say, father.

You travel?

Yeah.

Have you been.

Not.

To New Zealand?

I've been to China.

I wanted to go, like, next summer, but, I mean,

I haven't found anything so nice to meet.

I should plan for, like, the summer after that.

Um, but I felt that the problem is I have

friends in Australia, and I have friends.

I have this friend in New Zealand that kind of

wanted to make a combined trip like three weeks, three

weeks, two weeks in Australia and three weeks and then.

Um.

But because maybe my friend from New Zealand is going

to start, hopefully he's going to start grad school next

year.

If not, you kind of wants to find a job

in London then.

It's a bit difficult to plan a trip when team

staff is not sure when in the summer is going

to be.

So.

Yeah.

So.

Let's go.

Has it been the best time?

I like it.

I'm going to go.

And I'm not saying it's the last time I'm going,

but I have to say I'm just like, yeah, I'm

going to go.

And then maybe I have like once or twice more

in my life.

I have to go so.

Far away.

And that's it.

It's not just that, like it's expensive, this, you know,

like, okay, you know, it's like it's a once it's

not once in a lifetime because.

Thanks.

I had looked at the ticket and he looked really

nervous.

You can do it for like £1,000 or something like

this.

But I didn't like a stopover in Hong Kong.

Spending a few days in Hong Kong.

So it's not bad, but.

It's more like the whole hustle.

Like it's so, so, so far away.

Yeah.

When I went to.

Australia.

With the third day over in Dubai.

And then like you do, like 21, like you do

like 14 hours and think like, this is fucking how

like you go to sleep and then like you're above

the ocean and then you wake up.

Yeah.

Huh?

Right.

See?

Yes.

Every time I get a reply, I just think it's

not like.

I don't know.

Like I don't struggle to sleep.

It's just like I feel like it's.

You can't sleep for 14 hours.

You see what I mean?

No, I literally.

Went to Singapore on the 13 hour flight.

I slept.

I went to sleep before we took off and I

woke up just as relaxing both ways.

My problem is that I want to be awake when.

I wake me up again.

Hey, if you have someone with you.

Like when I went to China, I was like a

tag that you can put on the seat that says

like, oh yeah, wake me up when there is no

noise.

Yes.

But, um, I remember when I went and, you know,

like, you just sleep and you sleep like you would

just be sleeping for, like, a long time.

And you have.

To remember.

And do you see what I mean?

Like, yeah.

I think I should do this voluntarily while I still

have this.

Like as important.

What's it called.

How's Jedinak for you.

Uh yeah fine.

Is it jetlag.

I think it's pretty rough but I find I can

like I can stay awake and then do that thing.

Mostly because I slept.

I was like, yeah man.

I came back here from Singapore.

This is me back at the office.

We were complaining so much.

About.

The jet.

Yeah, about me sleeping.

Let me see what you think.

I'm just jealous.

Okay.

Because I get this better when you.

see.

The guy next to me started clapping when I wake

up.

Because you were working.

You thought it was bad.

I always make sure I exercise.

They make sure I do those exercise daily.

So you're tired.

But I'm like, okay, let me keep getting this.

Uh.

Yeah.

But like.

I don't know, I don't think.

I think it's better to do like six hours, like

full cycles and, like, in a good position and not

like ten hours in bed.

Does the nausea.

Produce use.

That?

Yes, sir.

Yeah.

Do you wanna go to Australia?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Speaking in Hong Kong.

Back.

Home.

I'd love to.

Hear something?

Yeah.

Maybe.

Probably.

I just know.

She was from Cambodia.

Okay.

Yeah.

Yeah.

You know, like sushi?

Yes.

It was.

You know.

Thank you so much.

Yeah.

Thanks.

You mentioned having kids in the country.

And then you're leaving me, like.

Sometimes.

Do you have to do that?

This is, you know, surprising.

Like, I don't.

Know, like, you come.

To a country, you have created that country.

And then you leave your kid and just.

Go away.

Kind of in a way.

That it's not a huge issue.

Like, I'm sure it does happen.

That's usually how you picture things going.

And.

back.

To.

That strategy.

What do you like?

About the response?

Yes.

It sounds gameplay.

Yeah.

Too much.

Too much pizza.

So there wasn't much.

He complained about.

Yeah.

Okay, so the the results that we got in the

from this is that essentially the weight of organised lobbies

is going to be higher.

But both in that paper, which was generally theoretical from

an agency paper and in the applied paper that we

want to look now, we don't know who's getting organised.

Okay.

So it's reasonable to assume that those that are organised,

that those with more resources, uh, perhaps concentrated industries, find

it easier to organise and so on.

Um, and also maybe one way to interpret this element

is more generally a sort of constraints that the politician

is facing in a democracy.

Uh.

To do, you know, to, to, to do what the

lobbies want.

Okay.

So it could relate to how hard it is to

change, to sort of to yield, to lobby.

So it could be this regulatory constraint.

You know, maybe I can take the money, but they

also have to hide it.

So I'm facing some cost in, you know, all this

and all this.

Uh, so you think that the democracy would impose more

cost, okay.

With the value of trying to think about one person,

one vote would, uh, uh, or some protection to groups

that cannot get organised would impose more constraints.

And, uh, maybe one way to view recent elections in

the US is to think that, you know, these constraints

proved too much for some billionaires and just maybe better

not to live in a democracy.

Okay, so maybe to think about this, uh, campaign contribution

paper together with the Robinson paper, about why do the

rich, why are the rich willing to live in a

democracy?

Okay, they may be afraid that in a non democracy,

they will place a medallion, uh, in from the army

or from the populace.

Or if you're not afraid of, if you're less afraid

of this and democracy imposes any restrictions, maybe.

You.

Might be better off not doing so.

I think this campaign contributions paper has donations paper together

with a smuggler, Robinson can somehow provide some framework to

think about movements towards, uh, especially because sort of the

more popular, uh, arguments for the rise of populism or

fascist movements recently or about, uh, poor people.

Okay.

Actually, You know, moving towards fascism.

But you also see that.

Those votes will be stolen.

So quite quickly.

Anyway, okay, that was.

My.

Rant.

Um, okay.

So it's a very nice I think the next paper

is a very nice piece of applied theory.

So taking a paper that Bernheim Winston not written about

politicians and globalism and using a theory which is in

general quite complicated, but, uh, using this to, to actually,

um, getting some applied insights about, about real world policy.

Uh, it's Grossman and Hellman.

The paper is called protection for sale because it's about

trade policy.

We will not get too much into trade.

I'm assuming there is no trade economist here.

I mean, they they do teach it in trade classes.

It's been hugely successful paper, but they've also followed this

up with papers on other applications for general taxation, minimum

wages.

So that's the original application.

So I'll focus on that.

Okay.

So the economic environment uh they're going to be different

goods in the economy.

The price of the domestic market for particular good is

going to be pi the free trade price.

So the global price is going to be pie star.

And there's going to be a very good zero that

we fix it price to one.

All the individuals in the economy are going to have

the same quasi linear preferences over goods that they consume.

Okay.

So the utility that you're going to get is, uh,

linear in the numerator.

Good.

Which you can think about money and your utility from

the other goods that you consume.

Okay.

X I.

Okay.

Excise.

How much you consuming from good I.

So it's going to be governed by a demand function.

Given the price of I an x zero the normal

variable is going to be everything else.

So you're going to have e as your income minus

your expenditure on all the other goods besides goods zero.

So that comes from the quasi linear utility.

Okay.

So we're building this up.

So what's the utility indirect utility of uh, the consumer

in this economy as a function of the prices and

her initial endowment.

Okay.

So if I'm just replacing X0 by now, whatever else

remains.

Right.

So I have e minus the sum of PDI, okay,

plus the utility from all the goods that are consuming.

Right?

So x plus the sum of UI I'm plugging for

x is what I'm getting is the my endowment and

consumers okay.

So it's my utility from my consumption.

So now it's you know instead of X I you

have the.

Utility from consumption as a function of the prices of

my demand minus the cost of my bad.

Okay.

Okay.

That's a standard.

Consumer experience okay.

We're going to have also besides consumers we're going to

have production.

So your endowment is essentially going to be labour income

which we're going to fix.

So don't supply flavour.

It's going to be fixed and your wage is going

to be fixed.

It's one.

So we're really not going to focus on that.

And it's totally not important.

We could just assume that people get endowments okay okay.

If you own okay.

If you own uh, a factor that is used in

production, okay, you're going to get rewarded again as a

function of the price of this factor.

And now we're using one of the lemmas I don't

remember one of these.

The supply of a particular good as a function of

price is uh is the marginal uh equals the marginal

reward for this for this factor.

Okay.

Okay, two more definitions.

Uh, this is the revenue of the government from a

vector of prices.

Okay.

What is the revenue if demand for capital supply?

If demand supply.

And my the price is higher than the free trade

price.

Okay, then the present positive government demand is less than

supply.

Demand is less than supplied means that we can export.

Uh, also.

Okay, so putting all of this together, I can write

the WP and the WP that we had before okay,

the w IP.

So just think about particular group I this particular group

owns the factors that are used to produce good AI

okay.

So they have the labour income which is not going

to play any role.

Then they have the uh profits from the production of

good AI.

That depends on the price.

Plus this group is also.

Some share of the consumers.

Okay.

So the share that that they are in the population

is alpha I and is the total number of people

in the economy.

As consumers what do you get.

You get the consumer surplus okay.

Plus you get uh the capital revenue from the.

So, so in this economy, the goods that are produced,

consumers buy goods, some of them produced here, some of

them produced outside whatever.

We have consumer surplus, we have revenue from taxation or

subsidies.

If we have prices that differ from the free trade

prices, this revenue is distributed equally in everyone.

So it's per capita revenue okay.

Consumer surplus is computed per capita in any case.

And uh.

Everyone has the same utility function as consumers okay.

So the utility function differs.

So the utility is a function of the good guys

are the good producers.

Okay.

The total measure in the economy is the total endowment,

the total profits plus consumer surplus, total consumer surplus, and

total the total RPI.

This is per capita.

So times N is the total.

The total government is the total welfare.

So is the symbol like a group is an interest

group right.

Well when we say group if it's organised it's an

interest.

And capita for each one of the groups or for

each one.

So this is already the total for the whole group.

Okay.

Because I have the share of them.

Okay.

So, uh, so these were defined per capita.

This is the total in the economy.

And alpha is the share of this group.

Okay.

Okay.

What is interesting here is that, I mean, you wouldn't

think ex-ante about these interest groups also as consumers.

Okay.

For example, if it's a very concentrated industry okay then

alpha I is going to zero.

And then their their role in society as consumers is

not important.

But if it's a large enough group, it's not.

The industry is not that concentrated.

Then they also get weighting the economy as consumer.

Okay.

Which is.

Good to a degree in the sense that, you know,

that we think about the total consumers, but it also

means that they have when they pressure, they have an

interest, not only, let's say, to protect the goods that

they produce, but also to reduce the prices of the

goods that they consume.

So they will interfere in, you know, in the whole

vector of prices in the, in the corner.

So sorry, I groups I find among the goods the

goods.

Yes.

Exactly right.

Yeah.

So you can think about people that don't own factories

used in production, or you can think about everyone is

owning factors using production, and the difference is that some

are organised, some are more.

Okay.

It's not going to matter.

As usual, let's hunt for the hidden assumptions here.

You know P is going to be the vector of

policies deviation from k star.

So it will be a way to sort of reward

lobbies for your contributions okay.

So going to use exactly the same model that we

have before in terms of the actual political environment.

But even in the context of this model, you could

think of other ways to reward lobbyists or organisations, right?

For example, uh.

You know, you could give them a larger share of

the revenues of the revenues from tax.

Okay.

Why am I saying this?

If you interfere with prices, for sure, you're going to

create inefficiencies.

Right.

Assuming the free trade and the resulting free trade is

that efficient outcome, uh, you're going to create inefficiencies.

If you just if you don't interfere in prices.

Okay.

But you give or you interfere in prices in a

way, maybe all of them in a way that is

the least inefficient, but you give just a larger share

of the public money.

Okay, so it's just in the form of redistribution.

You have less influence.

Okay.

So this is not allowed here.

So this is a hidden assumption.

And actually so at the end of the paper there

is a discussion about different methods of rewarding in schools.

Um, you can you can actually if you think about

what we've done before, it might be very beneficial for

lobby that the tools that the politician is using to

help us, okay are quite inefficient.

Why?

Because I need to compensate the politician from what he's

doing when I'm not there.

Right.

When other law is pushing them.

If when I'm not there, the politician is reaching a

very inefficient environment.

Okay.

What is this?

It means that it is not as high.

Okay, so I need to compensate her less.

Already at the efficient level.

I don't have to compensate a lot to move her

to another environment.

Okay.

So it's.

Okay, but here we don't have a question of what

tools can be used.

We're fixing them by fixing the tool to be the

vector of prices.

Okay, so we know what to do.

We know that we just need to assume who is

organised.

And then we find the equilibrium vector of prices.

So it's a whole vector.

All the goods I.

As what maximises.

Uh so this is for the groups that are organised.

So let's call it then.

I, uh, this is a part of a lobby group.

Lobby.

Lobbyist groups.

Okay, so we figured out what is WP.

We figured out what is w IP.

So whoever is organised gets the weight one plus and

one.

Okay.

Then we have to take a derivative with respect to

all the goods.

So all the pie.

Okay.

Essentially this.

Okay.

So this is a derivative of the utility of lobby

I from a change in the price of good Jay.

Okay.

Let's just rewind to see the utility of lobby.

I if good J is not a good time to

lobby for okay, then my utility should only represent my

consumer utility for changing the price of.

Cool.

Okay.

So it will be, uh, p I is here.

Okay.

So we're going to have this element which is sort

of let that, uh.

Import export.

Okay.

And then we're going to have uh, this multiplied by

d prime minus one over n y prime.

Okay, y prime.

Why is pi prime?

Uh.

Okay.

And if I also produce this.

Good.

So if j equals I then we're going to have

five prime here which is going to cancel with y

prime.

Okay.

So.

This part is this times the prime minus y prime

okay.

It's the.

It's this the derivative of this times this.

So the derivative of this is just defined as m

prime.

So m is the net import demand function.

Demand minus uh capital supply okay.

And.

Uh.

There was not only the, uh, revenue from taxation, there

was also consumer surplus.

Okay.

But it's using here also the first order condition, the

fact that you prime actually your prime equals p, I

think, right, in.

A quasi linear.

Maximisation.

Okay.

So that's another stuff that is here if you want

to do this derivative.

Um, and the final thing is that if it's if

j equals I, this is just an indicator function YI1.

So right.

So if j equals I one then I have the

pipeline which is equals one.

So that's nothing magical here.

Just.

Just taking a derivative.

But that's the.

Okay, so this element one times y is the only

element that comes from the from the production, okay.

The rest is what comes from the US being consumers.

Okay.

Now if you put all the groups together, all the

groups together, and you just add up this.

So for all the groups that are not J, we

have this plus one for J if they are organised.

Okay.

So all of this together, just this summing over.

Okay.

You get this.

What do we have here.

Okay.

This is the one for the group that is organised.

And Alpha L is for all the other groups that

are organised and then put pressure on the group okay.

Okay.

And if you now think about the total population of

voters.

Okay.

So the population of voters, then that's what's going to

maximise.

The free trade.

Right.

Because M prime is negative.

So because it's d minus y d prime is negative

demand function slope minus y supply function.

So so negative.

So you want to set this.

Then we just put this all together.

Okay.

So.

That's what we did.

We took.

So let's take.

So all of these are the ones that are organised.

So we have this derivative with respect to some PJ

plus A and.

Everyone in respect to PJ.

And we just get the solution.

So the solution is here in just in terms of

tax okay or subsidy.

Okay.

So it's the deviation from free trade.

There are a lot of economic parameters here.

The first one that I.

Is, uh, why the production over the net import demand.

And here is import demand elasticity.

Okay.

So you put this derivative, you quite sum to zero.

And essentially you get a very intuitive equation for the

vector of taxes and subsidies.

So if good AI is organised then I have one

here okay.

And it also means that there is a share of

the population that is part of a lobby group.

Okay.

So Alpha L is going to be positive okay.

So I have one minus alpha.

So already and all the other parameters are positive.

So already that means that I'm going to uh benefit

from price is is producer price.

That is higher when I sell my goods in this

economy.

The higher is alpha L okay.

The lesser benefiting me, right?

Why?

Because everyone else is organised.

Okay, take Alpha L to one.

Okay?

All the others is consumers are pushing back against this.

Okay?

In particular, if everyone in the economy is organised okay

we're going to get zero deviation.

If everyone is organised then W is exactly the sum

of w I.

So it's like maximising this.

Okay, so that's a nice, you know, simple result which

we could also already see from here frankly.

Okay.

But it tells us that it doesn't mean that there

is no contribution.

Right.

Actually there's maybe a lot of money that politicians are

managing to extract because every lobby, without them, the outcome

would be much.

The outcome would be different.

Okay.

Okay.

What else?

Uh, a is how much whether the politician is putting

on the public.

So the sort of general public welfare and the general

consumer's welfare.

So we can see that the higher is a.

The lower is the deviation from free trade.

Free trade.

And these economic parameters obviously, uh, measure how inefficient it

is to move on free to.

All right.

So if I need to move the elasticity such that

if I need to, uh, if, uh, when I change

the price, there isn't a lot of difference in the

demand.

Right?

Then it's not a big deal for me as a

politician, the inefficiency involved in the welfare of the public

or welfare of consumers in terms of tax revenues and

consumer surplus is relatively small, okay.

And that means that it's easier for me to do

this, or it's easier for the lobby to convince me

to do it with.

Okay.

So we have all this theory that we developed before.

And now, you know, it's easy for us to find

the actual, the actual, uh, vector of prices in the

economy.

And then the next step that we can do is

try and find the.

You know, of course, in such, you know, if this

is a policy, if this is a prediction of the

model.

We need to know who is organised.

Um.

Why they organise, how much resources have.

Okay.

So is that clear?

Okay.

You can do this derivation yourself if you're interested.

It's not, you know, nothing.

Nothing special.

Okay.

So let's try and figure out a few examples.

Right.

Because I don't know who's organised, but a few examples

that shed some light on the contributions and perhaps about

the question of whether it is useful to organise it.

So the first easy example is to think about just

the single, uh, lobby group.

Okay.

So we can use the tools that we, that we

have both in the application and in the theory to

know what's going to be the contribution of this lobby

and what's going to be the actual policy that, um,

is going to be implemented so we know it drafts.

Okay, so we know we single organised lobby.

Without me.

The politician is just going to choose free trade, right.

So that means that that's her basic utility.

Right.

So.

Thanks.

A uh, so what I need to do for any

policy that I want to move her to.

Okay.

I need to pay something.

What do I need to pay?

I need to pay the difference between what she gets

with free trade, what the public gets from free trade.

Okay, so that would be for any policy okay.

And.

Then essentially so this is a bit like a principal

agent because there's just one principal All right.

So first I figure out what do we do in

principle, agent.

We do it in two stages.

We figured out what's the cost of each action.

And then we ask ourselves, what's the action that I

want to induce such that maximises my utility.

Right.

So we have our utility as a lobby.

And then I know that I have to pay this.

I mean, we already know the policy will arise in

equilibrium, but that's how a single group solve it even

without this machinery.

Right?

All right.

So for each policy that I'm going to induce, that's

the cost.

That's the incentive cost, right.

This is like principal agent and then I'm maximising over

P.

Okay.

Which is exactly this.

right?

Okay.

Because AWP stars imitation.

So I'm maximising my answer plus a.

W.

Which is what we do here for one organism.

Great.

It's nice and reassuring to see that the common agency

model also gives us the same.

Uh, if we come from the view of the common

agency model, it's exactly when we have just one principal.

It's exactly like a principal agent.

Okay.

And in terms of the policy, we know that if

there is a if this industry is not concentrated enough,

all the prices in the economy will be destroyed.

Okay.

The share of people within this lobby is strictly positive

on the prices.

So import subsidies on all the goods and export subsidy

on the export taxes on.

What I produce.

The government gets the same utility as free trade.

And again, it's reasonable.

There is no competition.

So the government cannot be better.

So the lobby here extract rents.

Uh.

Okay.

Okay, good.

The next case, all the consumers are organised.

So let's just suppose that there are two industries.

So all the consumers are organised in two lobbies.

Now there is more competition and we know that when

alpha equals one, we know that we're going to end

up with two.

So now we need to find out a little bit

more complicated.

Right.

What the what the what each lobe is contributing.

So let's think about this.

So we already know what the policy is going to

be.

So to start this we know.

This our worst.

You mean everyone's organised.

Everyone is organised.

And it's enough to think about 2 to 2 industries.

Think about more than two groups okay.

Okay.

So we have a B.

Let's call them and be the two mommies.

Uh.

Okay, so.

What happens without me if I'm not there?

I don't exist.

We know what we did before.

Where the other lobbies would push.

Right.

We already figured out there's going to be some a

okay.

And see before Nova, there's going to be some pa

and ka pa.

Okay.

That the other lobby would push for And we found

it out in the previous slide.

In.

Which there was only one organised loading.

So we know the outcome.

Okay, so we know that without me, I'd be without

me.

Uh, the utility of the politician is w lethal a

times w a plus.

He is contributing.

For.

Okay.

And so.

I need to keep the politician different here.

Right.

So what am I going to contribute to?

What's to move the politician to free trade.

Right.

I'm moving the politician to free trade.

So my contribution for this.

So this is the actual contribution.

I'm not now finding the schedule, but we can complement

all the functions later on to make sure that the

condition is not deviating to something else.

Okay.

So I have a slob.

I have to contribute.

To move the politician back.

Back to free trade from what will be able to

do, which we found.

Okay.

Similarly.

There's going to be some policy that's lobby free will

convince the government without lobbying.

Okay, so after we found these two policies we know

how much to go.

So, you know, complete this exercise.

About this, because we know that the episode is going

to be free trade, right?

Yes, exactly.

Exactly.

Yeah.

I mean, we're just sort of looking at interesting cases

and simple cases to figure out.

Of course you can.

Yeah, you can construct what you want.

Three groups are organised.

Then you'll have the system equation which is.

Okay.

And the last case you can do is to think

about uh wholesale going to zero.

The organised sector is negligible in terms of the share

of the population.

And then we know that With only the goods of

the organised sector are going to get protection and the

rest are going to be trade.

Um.

So what does it mean?

It means that it's sort of it's easier for the

lobbies to push the direction because they're creating less inefficiency,

because they don't have the weight as consumers.

Okay.

Which is sort of maybe a bit with our intuition

that the more concentrated the lobby, powerful people typically think

that if it's more concentrated, it's just easier for you

to collect the money among the people.

But here it's also about, you know, it's actually easier

for you to push a politicians in your direction because

they are losing less in terms of wealth.

Okay, so that's roughly the paper.

So we can have sort of a more so, uh,

it was very successful as an application.

So, you know, and again, I think a very successful

application of theory in general in actual policymaking, the papers

that actually did empirical analysis of, uh, trade policy, uh,

using using this, uh, this framework.

There's been many extension within trade, for example, thinking of

domestic lobbies and global multinational type of lobbies are other

extensions of themselves and other expansions to minimum wage and

general taxes.

Okay, so what we don't have in this paper.

As I said, you could potentially take a step back

from this and ask yourself maybe given some organisation costs

or something, or, you know, what is the equilibrium of

actually lobby groups forming, right.

So we don't know which lobbies will organise this.

This is fixed in this paper.

I don't think.

There is.

A good paper of that.

You don't have to do it in the framework of

trade, but more generally.

I mean, of course there are the issues of overcoming

public good provision.

When you try and organise the lobbying.

But, uh.

We really don't have.

Endogenous.

Lobbyists.

What just happens if you add the cost of formation

depend on the size of the lobby?

And the utility costs and the utility that they are

going to get.

So the first stage you can think about in the

first stage that lobbies decide whether to get organised or

not.

Cool.

Uh, with the clear boundaries that we assume the lobby

organises around this particular industry.

And.

Then they they know what is going to be the.

Yeah, I just don't think.

I almost done that.

It's crazy.

Not not successfully.

It's not just, uh.

I think he would want to do it in a

more again, in a more theoretical framework for us to

understand, because there are a lot of issues about coordination.

Right.

Um.

She.

Talks about this.

Right.

The signalling game.

It's the second game.

But one thing that we don't include in that is

that as an incentive to signal as well into the

policy around education and maximum education levels.

So that's an additional incentive for people to signal in

like a first page is that identify themselves as.

Um.

So not sure.

What are they signalling here?

Are they signalling that they are okay, so they have

sufficiently low cost that they can organise and pressure?

Yeah.

So if, if the uh if it is sequential then

I can see that.

Uh, but if we think about the simultaneous state in

which the groups are getting organised, um, that would lose

that.

So for example, resources resource has played some role here.

In the sense.

Right when I was think about just one principle.

If it's too costly for me to move the politician

from free trade, then you know that how much I

have to pay her is not worth while my utility

for moving to any policy, then I don't love it.

Right.

So there is an element of resources here, but it's

not really modelled.

Real life.

We think that interest groups differ in how much they

gain and the types of resources that they can amass.

So they're going to be a lot of asymmetries in

that the direction.

So maybe we need to say, you know, if I,

if I know that I can amassed a lot of

resources, it's worthwhile for me to organise even without lobbying,

just to make sure that even without actually lobbying the

politicians, just first of all, to make sure that others

are not getting organised to fight against something of that

nature.

Then it's interesting to think.

I think about, uh, which lobbies are sort of.

You know, if I'm pressuring politicians from the outside, I

can pressure all of them.

Uh, but if I become a party or form a

player in the political system, then I'm subject to different

rules.

I have more authority, more power to make decisions, but

subject to different rules that can be less corrupt, I

guess.

Actually, uh, we don't see industries becoming parties.

Uh, but we did see, you know, workers know this

becoming the Labour Party.

Um.

Which makes maybe sense, because it's much harder for the

whole workers to get organised and push from the outside.

Right?

It's just hard to coordinate.

Such a.

Party.

Uh.

And definitely it's hard to collectively.

Think about, uh.

Religious parties.

And think about sort of, um, when in Europe, democracy

sort of started forming.

There were a lot of religious parties.

Clerical.

And then, uh, you know, church is a clear interest

groups in terms of laws.

Um.

But that's one.

Institution.

So it's.

Very simple.

So it would be interesting to actually look at in

which countries religious parties formed and how they were successful

compared to poaching from the US.

And, uh, and many countries don't have this.

Okay.

What else do we do here?

Um, so we talked a little bit about the tools

that.

Governments are using.

Other issue with the tool is that.

Some tools are really blatant and obvious to the public

that you are needing to install scopes.

Some tools may be more.

It's not clear.

So maybe we've learned that if we see a lot

of, you know, every every other week, they sort of

open the road to do construction where you're thinking, okay,

it's corruption.

You know, paying to the mayor is paying somehow helping

construction companies.

So.

You know, when some, some stuff seems more obvious, but

some stuff is, is much better than government contracts, right?

I mean, this type of stuff is very hard to

prove only when, you know, the maybe total failure of

these companies.

Like with the.

PPE masks.

In the Okay.

Don't.

Play with that.

Let's go.

Yeah.

But but but then politicians would try to avoid it,

right?

You think after some level they will try to use

tools that are less less obvious?

So you have to say, you know, I'm increasing the

price of this because I want to benefit the owners

of this industry.

You saying something about job creation?

You try and use whatever tools you're using.

You try to pretend it's not corruption, but you may

try and use different tools, which is maybe the reason

why you're not using direct redistribution, right?

Just paying a particular taking, you know, particular group of

corporations.

There's a lot of hiding complexity as well, I think.

So they will do like as subsidies for every industry

it feels like.

But they're all like too complicated.

And the mesh of them is very difficult for voters

or anyone who understands.

Right.

And similarly, the tax system on corporations and different benefits

of corporations and some industries.

You this is done less now in the 80s when

countries open to free trade more.

So uh, there are some industries.

What we find is infant industries that you need to

focus on because you need to give them time to,

uh, which seems very reasonable.

Right.

But, you know, you don't want to use the free

trade price.

Otherwise there is no way to build up this industry

in the short.

Maybe it wouldn't last in the long term.

Fine.

But at In the beginning to see if it's going

to work.

From the outside, for the non-expert, of course, difficult to

understand whether these industries are worth pursuing.

And there's also like.

So I was speaking to someone who used to work

for the Dairy Farmers of Canada lobby, and she was

saying that the reason why they have today, the way

that they do price control in the dairy in Canada

is they give each farmer, uh, quantity allocation of how

much they're able and allowed to produce, and then there's

no import.

And the reason why they introduce this is because America

was subsidising its dairy farmers.

So I feel like that's like a lot of incentive

for the lobbies in the two countries to collaborate or

form coalitions, right.

Because you can threaten to increase your subsidies in one

country and then the other country.

If there's any sort of, um, free trade or trade

between the two countries, will then suffer so they can

use that as a threat to then ask for greater

subsidy.

So there's this nice cross-border collaboration incentive as well.

So there is a paper.

So I think I mentioned.

Right.

So there is a paper about foreign and local and

domestic lobbies.

Uh, because you can definitely think about.

You know, multinationals and local and.

Domestic lobbying.

Uh, but I didn't see this point that even for

global lobbying, it's going to be and I guess it

can happen only locally across the borders.

It's very difficult to see how it will happen.

And much of that, it's these wine Yes.

The juices that were involved says huge wine subsidies.

Yeah.

Okay.

The other issue is that, uh, you know, if we

don't think of the money that the politicians are getting

is putting it into their pockets.

So what type of political systems are more prone to

competition, collecting some effort from, you know, either money that

allows them to campaign.

Uh, or.

Or, uh, effort in campaigning that sort of plays to

the way this a way.

Right.

And if the money is becoming more important than subsistence.

Once we allow more money in the system and important.

And then.

Uh.

The weight on the welfare of the public is reduced,

which plays into the hands of the locals.

Uh.

So there are also papers about the papers about this,

but also papers about asking, what are you.

Not asking these questions.

Sorry, but modelling, uh, campaign contributions before the election.

So are you going to donate to both parties, to

one party?

And how much are you going to donate?

Just imagine two lobbies, one general, more interested in one

party, the other more interested in the other party.

But you may also want to somehow cure Show yourself,

uh.

By getting some excellent agreement with both.

In the model that Thorsten showed us.

A lot of the lobbying action on the equilibrium was

through the threat of supporting the opposition movement.

Equilibrium?

Yeah.

Yeah.

It was.

Talking about it.

In all these papers, in that, like always, the agent

is the government, right?

It was.

I'm thinking, is there any case to think about that

agent plus any kind of big firm like the this.

Uh.

Is to apply to other environments.

Thank you.

You can think of, uh, government vying for multinationals.

Okay.

Okay.

So I'm going to give you tax reductions.

If you come to my country or if assuming that

you're going to have plants in different countries, but you

can increase or decrease the size.

So that's, uh.

So in that.

Sense, you can think about the big foreign agent.

Uh.

I mean, many.

Planets, right?

If you think about any of these, if you think

about the NSC or the department.

Uh.

Central.

Okay.

So in many organisations.

This would give.

More resources.

To.

My department.

But it's not only resources.

So how am I lobbying?

Of course I'm not giving money to them, but I

am, you know, I, I maybe I should do my

division.

We work.

People work harder.

Um, so they have many favours.

Um, also.

And I want the organisation or firm could choose a

particular.

Course of action that would benefit more my division.

Yes, I think of.

Things in a context of bureaucracy.

One issue with this model for looking at that is

that you don't really change the size of the pie.

Yes.

So I think I feel like with our attitude that

Parliament's negotiating with each other, then each department should also

be thinking about the health of the institution as a

whole, right when they are doing this.

And if they don't, because otherwise they they risk all

that they were still losing if they make money.

And that's the reputation of the Institution?

Yes.

Uh, the I mean, you could, but if you put

a lower weight, right?

I mean, don't put the same way on the rest

of the night.

So it means the rest and aggregates there is, again,

less weight on the rest.

And.

Uh.

Okay.

Okay.

Next week we'll talk about politics.

Thank you in advance.

The more I give you more time.

Lecture 7:

Oh, you are more of a moron.

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

So, yeah, I mean, you are.

An empirical person.

Okay.

Okay.

Yeah, yeah.

No, I, I don't theory, but I find it very

fascinating.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I'm really happy that I'm on this course and able

to kind of hear and learn this stuff, but I

have difficulty seeing myself ever.

Yeah.

Yeah, totally.

Well, I'm just auditing.

Um, yeah.

Because I'm a third year.

Uh, so I really, but I really don't need to

take courses.

But in primary, like, we didn't have, like, uh, a

proper political economy class.

So you're at Queen Mary?

Yeah.

Yeah.

So I asked them if I could audit.

And last year I audited, but only the second semester

because I was overlapping with some of my lectures.

But it's very interesting because I've never taken a political

economy class.

Plus.

Uh.

Which is a shame, but, like, I was studying at

Bocconi and there was a Bellini.

Yeah.

So, I mean, huge guy, but yeah, they told me

it was, um, not very good at teaching.

Oh, yeah.

That's sometimes the case that.

Yeah, exactly the research, but not.

But, uh, um, so I chose to do advanced macro.

And I mean, I think first one was good.

Yeah, I enjoyed it.

Yeah.

Yeah, I'm a student, so, uh, so I'm a college

university, uh, doing, like, third slash fourth year.

And we also don't have really any courses like this.

Yeah.

Even if I do like education.

You know.

Education.

Yeah.

Education stuff.

Cool.

Uh, from a very data perspective.

So this is like a different but also very related.

So yeah, I don't know.

It's always uh like uh and also like looking at

different works and seeing things from a different mindset as

you like.

Also.

Yeah.

But yeah, I wish I was that at Eureka in

a way, because I tend to be very philosophical on

certain things.

And I think that theory helps you a lot.

Yeah, but I'm not a very mathematical person.

So, yeah.

I kind of sometimes think the theory is like two

philosophical or there's such a lot of assumptions and then

like matching maybe matching how to.

Yeah, that kind of sometimes just but it's really nice

to work on it.

So what do you work on mainly right now.

Um, I would like to study how other like diversity

in the workforce leads to.

More.

Or less organised labour.

Oh, you know, it's very related to diversity and public

goods provision.

Yeah.

Like Alison did a lot of these things, but, um,

there's not much else, uh, especially regarding organised labour because

I'm wondering, like if you have a very diverse workforce.

Uh, is it harder to organise?

I think maybe it's harder because of language barriers.

Communication, that there's a working paper that I would say

is quite related to this.

So like, uh, what happens with Unionisation when you have

influence?

Oh, really?

Uh, I don't know if you've seen it.

I think it's probably just a working paper, like.

You see, by.

Uh, it's cinnamon and, uh.

IBM.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, that kind of thing I would like

to do.

Yeah, but try to, uh.

Yeah, I don't remember what they do, but I think

I know the guys because they have.

There's a lot of these like union papers from Norway,

and now there's a paper looking like, yeah.

It's been all of the.

Yeah.

They have some something.

They use this as an instrument.

I don't know if I've completely bought.

No, but they have something.

Yeah.

Because like, uh, like with immigration usually.

Um, and but there's also a paper by Carlo Medici

who is a very young, uh, uh, guy.

Um, and it's the job market paper is on immigration

and, uh, um, unionisation.

But it's a historical paper.

Yeah, but I mean, uses.

What did you say his name is?

Carlo Medici.

I think I've actually seen this paper presented at a

workshop a couple of weeks ago.

Um, uh, SFO in Munich.

Munich?

Yeah.

There was this, like, migration workshop, and I'm quite sure

that he was cool there.

Like, it sounds.

the name sounds familiar and the topic sounds.

But there was something.

Okay.

Okay.

I was in Cambridge yesterday.

What a strange place.

I'm from Queen Mary and nice to meet you.

Thank you.

I missed the first class.

Sorry.

That's okay.

I grew up in Cambridge.

Yeah, I know.

There's a strange.

I mean.

It's, uh, like, you know, the faculty want to go

to lunch with each other.

They can't go to one college because that makes sense

in the house.

It's really.

In Cambridge, just the more modern one.

Compared to Oxford, do you think?

Really?

You.

Okay.

Good morning.

Um, so today we're going to talk about political parties

as a, as a, as an institution.

And.

One good analogy to think about parties is how we

think in economics about fun.

Okay.

So a lot of questions that we can ask are,

you know, why do they form, how do they form,

how they organise externally?

What is the scope of the party like what's the

scope of the firm?

Um.

What is the relationship between parties and electoral system?

So you can ask, you know, what type of firms

the same way we ask in economics, what types of

firms are more likely to arise for a particular economic,

economic environment, and what is the effect of parties on

the actual economic outcome?

Right.

I mean, that's that's again something which is key to

us as economists, not just, you know, political scientists may

be interested in the question of what is the number

of parties or in presidential, in a parliamentary system, you

expect more parties than in the morality system.

Um.

When the Italian system.

Um, but that is, you know, to a degree, if

it doesn't have any effect on the actual economic outcome,

it is less interest and interest for us.

And you could also ask normative questions.

So if we're thinking about aggregating preferences, do parties do

it in a good way okay.

For having some normative criteria.

Okay.

The title that I have is Parties and Redistribution.

Because sort of what I'm going to focus on, not

in the first paper I described, but when we think

about economic outcomes, as I said in the beginning, almost

all of them relate to some form of redistribution, either

via general distribution of other goods.

But essentially this is what governments do.

The scope for redistribution is the size of government and

the types of institutions that the government is using.

Um.

That's that's, uh, this is really the most important economic

outcomes.

Okay.

Um, so possible answers for the role of parties.

And why do we have parties out there?

One.

One answer is that parties coordinate voters across multiple equilibrium

okay.

Or potentially across.

Probably.

Probably a better way to think about this is across

multiple candidates okay.

So if you know, if we have three candidates and

here the vote of the left is split between these

two candidates.

When voters roughly vote sincerely okay.

It makes sense that these two form a party together

so that they coordinate and offer sort of a better

choice to voters, in the sense that this left wing

voters will be more represented in the sense that they

can coordinate, they can coordinate together.

So that's one possibility.

Um.

Whatever explanation for parties we have we, you know, want

to think, why do we really need that purpose of

a party around it?

Maybe these two can somehow talk to each other, but

it does make sense that to somehow enforce some sort

of agreement between them, you know, you know, we run

together with this type of policy or just one of

us runs.

Maybe I did the wrong thing.

So one of us runs today, the next one runs

tomorrow, or something of that form.

Uh, we need maybe some institution around it.

So it does make sense.

Another explanation for parties is that they mobilise voters.

Okay.

So again, you have the sort of increasing returns to

scale.

You have sort of an organisation that allows you to

pass voters to the polling booth.

I mean, this this is really sort of, uh, a

very basic economic, uh, argument that it's very costly for

single candidates to somehow How organised all this.

And then, you know, we are together in a party.

We save on cost.

Okay.

One explanation that I'll discuss in more details is what

parties do is allow to reveal more information about politicians.

Uh, mostly to the voters.

Okay.

And here the idea is that parties create brand names.

Okay.

So think about the elections in the US, there are

many types of elections.

For example, for the district attorney, for the sheriff or

this and that.

Many candidates are of unknown bias.

You know, uh, are they more rightwing in the left

wing?

If I associate myself, I run on behalf of the

Democratic Party.

Okay.

People think that they know a little bit more about

me.

Okay.

Because the Democratic Party has a particular brand name.

So this and this brand name has to come out

in a name.

Okay.

So I'll discuss the paper that does this.

And finally this this, uh, is my paper.

The idea is that parties allow for a wider range

of policy to be policies to be represented.

Let me delay the discussion.

The discussion is.

There may be other answers.

So these are the answers currently in the literature.

We can think of other answers.

Uh, one important thing that I already mentioned is that

in many models there is no real distinction between parties

and candidates.

So most of the models in political economy talk about

when they say parties, they really mean unitary actors, which

could be candidates or politicians, but the internal organisation of

parties is not explored.

Okay.

And how it's how it interacts with other features of

the political system.

So that's what we're trying to unpack today.

Um.

So we want to know what is the internal organisation

against the theories of the firm.

We used to treat the firm as a unitary actor.

And then at some point, we thought about incentives of

managers and internal organisations, of firms, hierarchies, delegation and so

on.

So that's, uh, and the two first papers that I

sent to you, uh, can you look really look at

this type of stuff?

Okay.

The interpretation, especially in primaries, uh, which is really important.

Okay.

Another thing that we want to understand, especially given what

we did last week, is what is the difference between

parties and interests.

Okay.

So a lot of the roles that I've discussed could

potentially be taken up by interest groups, for example, mobilising

voters to the polling booth.

Interest groups can do that.

Any organisation that is somewhat affiliated with the party, uh,

may support the interest of the party in, for example,

shipping voters today to the polling booth.

Um.

Allowing some coordination that can also be a role of

interest groups may be, you know, creating a focal politician

here and telling voters, look, this one is endorsing one

politician or saying this one has no chance.

So you can think of other organisations, um.

Creating this, but maybe not in the same, you know,

intensity or not the same ability.

But it's again, it is something I mentioned last time

sort of what is the scope when when does an

interest group stopping an interest group become party?

This is really an interesting and interesting question.

There is one possibility to think about.

A lot of times we think about interest groups as

something that is sort of unidimensional.

They focus on one one thing, okay.

That's their strength.

They're really passionate about this thing, and they managed to

unite people that maybe have other interests, differing interests on

other stuff.

They managed to unite them behind the particular course.

And once you do become a party, you can not

only focus on one thing, right?

Uh, in the sense that voters expect you once you're

in power, you know, to, to make decisions on other

topics as well.

Uh, so this is something so we talk we will

talk about multi dimensional policy spaces today.

But uh, again there is no no good model of

this.

Okay, so somebody wants to say something before I move

to the first paper.

Excuse me.

Sir.

So what is missing in terms of.

We don't have any good models.

We don't have any model of this.

So it's not a good model.

We don't I don't I don't know of any paper

that looks at this question properly.

I think it's a really interesting question.

Uh, that could also have, you know, predictive power.

There is a lot of data.

Uh.

Maybe there is a model out of when I say

we don't have a good model, I'm saying I don't

know of any model.

Assuming that I know the good papers.

I guess that's.

Okay.

Okay.

And as we know, there are you know that different

electronic systems of course.

And hence it's true that parties would be different.

They would take different forms and maybe different roles in

different electoral system.

So it's not that when we give an explanation to

a party, it doesn't mean that it's true all over

the world.

Okay.

Or all electoral system.

So for example, in all of a lot of autocratic

regimes, there are parties.

One party.

Okay.

They probably feel it feel a different role compared to

democratic elections.

Okay.

So when we say an explanation for parties, you know,

there could be different explanations for different electoral, different societies.

Okay.

So this is a paper by Jim Snyder.

And Michael think, uh, Snyder is mostly an empirical political

economist and think is, uh, I can could think of

theories, but this is a theory paper.

So the idea in a nutshell that I've explained is

that parties fulfil a role as creating branding.

Okay.

So what is the role?

The role is assuming that citizens don't have full information

about politicians professions.

Okay, so if you go back to week one, I

said that in the citizen candidate model, politicians cannot commit

when they run for re-election.

Re-election.

Sorry.

So they cannot commit.

So they can only run.

They can either not run and if they run, essentially,

if this is my ideal policy, voters know my ideal

policy.

So that's essentially what I'm offering.

I cannot offer credibly anything else.

Maybe a decree.

We observe them offering other stuff, but the assumption is

that voters know that this is the ideal real policy.

Okay.

So this is a strong assumption that voters know that

all candidates and again, maybe mainly in small elections, but

I think also in important elections, you know, it's not

easy to to understand the ideal policy.

And so.

And this is well for a while this is a

problem.

Right.

If you don't know what you're voting for.

Right.

So assuming that once the politician gets power she implements

her ideal policy, you don't know what you're voting for.

And in particular you're facing a lot of uncertainty, which

is also we think is not good given some risk

aversion for preferences.

Right.

Okay.

So the idea of this model is as follows.

Uh, it's sort of models a notion of political entrepreneurs

that form parties.

And when they form party, they essentially create the party

position.

Okay, so let's say I form this particular party and

it's a right wing party.

And this is the party position.

Okay.

We we will go back to the incentives of the

entrepreneurs a little bit later.

And now I go and recruit politicians to my party.

Okay.

And the case option is an assumption of the cost

of joining a party whose public position is very different

than my own.

Okay, so I'm now a politician.

Okay.

And this is my ideal policy here, very much on

the left.

And for me to join this party is going to

be quite costly.

Okay, so we can think about quadratic cost.

For example.

So the larger is the distance between me and the

declared policy of disparity.

The the more I suffer from being in this party.

They don't microphone this cost.

You can think of several explanation.

One explanation is sort of a behavioural one.

I really dislike to be in a party where there

is some machinery that advocates this and, and uh.

Um.

So that's one possibility.

Another possibility is to think about, uh, the what the

party knows.

Imagine that the particle screening candidates.

And because the panel does really care potentially about this

policy.

Okay.

That's really care about this policy.

They don't want politicians that are too far from this

policy okay.

So remember, the assumption is that once the politician is

elected in her district, let's say she implements her ideal

policy.

Okay.

So then the people would suffer from policies that are

too different from their own ideal policy.

And hence she weeds out.

So she is more able, as an entrepreneur compared to

the voters, to learn about the purposes of this politician.

So maybe the size of the cost or here represents

the apparatus of the party, the ability of the party

to learn about the preferences of the population.

Or you can think that after the election.

Uh.

Yeah.

I don't have other experience.

Okay, so that's the general idea.

So what are the details?

The details are.

The thought is the politicians are simply uniformly distributed on

zero one line.

Okay.

I am sort of emphasising the bounds here because the

boundaries are important.

That is the bounded policy space.

And what they do is they look at two environments.

One is which there is only one party that arises.

Okay.

So let's say that this is the median of the

politicians without parties at all.

When somebody runs for election, what do I know about

them?

I know the their average policy.

Sorry.

Okay.

The average policy and I know the variance.

So I.

All candidates are the same to me.

I know nothing about them.

So if a politician runs as an independent okay.

That's I can compute my expected utility from this politician

given this mean and the variance of your honesty.

Now let's say that there is one party that is

formed.

Um, and these costs are biting enough.

Okay.

And let's say that this party is, is formed around

the this particular mean.

Okay.

So then the assumption is that I go to politicians

one after the other.

And when a politician joins my party.

Once the politician joins my party in one district, it's

great.

I don't look for someone else.

Okay.

So given that voters know the mean, and we know

that this is now the position of this centrist party,

okay, we understand the cost function.

So we understand that this party is formed of this

integral.

So this gives us the idea that already so of

course we have to check it in equilibrium.

There is no other entrepreneurs looking at parties here or

there okay.

This gives us the idea that what parties do is

reduce the variance to voters.

So if I am an independent candidate and I don't

run in this party, I'm just going to have a

lower chance of being elected, okay?

Because there is greater variance about one time.

Okay.

So there is a role here even for one party.

Okay.

If the cost are large enough, but but not too

large.

So this party can spread out enough.

There's going to be no no room for other parties.

Okay, so.

That's one way to think about the role of party.

Just reducing the variance okay.

But there could be equilibrium in this model also with

two parties.

For example let's think of uh one party.

This is very right wing right.

This is one.

And the cost are such.

That.

These are the people that want to enter.

But if I go on that side, there are no

more people.

Okay.

So compared to the same party, if it was in

the middle.

The variance here is even reduced further right.

Compared to the same cost.

Right?

If I would place this party here, there would be

greater variance.

Right.

And this is because of the bound.

Okay.

So the idea is to say look extremist parties.

Are sort of more cohesive or more accurate in the

sense that.

Right.

Sorry.

As a brand.

I got better branding with that.

Yeah.

Okay.

So it's possible that we will have.

You know.

Maybe the.

Same.

Okay.

So a party that is centrist.

So it's better for voters because for more for more

voters, because of the mean.

Okay.

So I'd rather have overall as the we think about

the distribution of voters overall this this ideal policy is

better or this mean of a part of this party,

this ideal policy for the politicians.

This party is better for me compared to this one

on average.

Okay.

But this party has an advantage that it reduces my

variance.

Okay.

So a voter that is, let's say equally distributed from

the mean of this.

So the mean of this party actually here.

So voters that is you know, equal distance from these

two will prefer these particles of lower violence.

Okay.

So overall what parties do is reduce the variance.

But extremist parties may be able to do it better

than.

The size of the boundary depends on the cost.

And the particular cost.

That's probably the parameter here.

And you know, not sure.

I think they use quadratic.

We assume it's the same for every part.

The same.

Yes.

The assumption is that it's the same for everyone.

Which is interesting.

So so sometimes we think that maybe extreme politicians have

more intense preferences, but maybe it's just this one.

It's not that they have more intense preference, but on

average they are sort of more, uh, yeah.

Cohesive?

Yeah.

Do they do it.

With an entry game as well?

So there is the entry, the I think there are

just two entrepreneurs.

And in general we are I think the show that

we are either in disequilibrium.

So both entrepreneurs choose, I think the main or one

goes here and one goes here.

Okay.

And essentially I think in the business they just want

to maximise the number of politicians that will win for

them.

Okay.

The number of districts today.

So I think it's a nice way to think about,

uh, maybe parties in the US because, you know, the

presumably they're subject to negative preferences and there are so

many elections that people need to go and have no

clue about the candidates.

It makes sense from one to the other.

Give some information about you.

Um, we spoke about the interest groups last time in

thinking about preference aggregation.

But if you think about interest groups as also platforms

that give information to voters, again, you know, if the

candidates in this party are endorsed by the NRA, the

National Rifle Association, you'll know a bit more about those,

right?

So it's another way to so, you know, to to

somehow deliver credibly to voters.

It's hard when we think about interest groups giving endorsement.

It's not clear if this is the that this is

the politician that will implement the policy because it's her

intrinsic preferences or because I bought her.

Right.

Okay.

But to a degree doesn't matter anymore.

Right.

Because in any case, that's the that's what the politician

is going to do.

Maybe important when we model these two versions of relationship

between interest groups and the endorsement of politicians.

But.

Okay, so it's a role that interest groups could serve

to give information, but again, maybe not perfectly because maybe

it's again, it's biased by the fact that it can

also buy me to a degree.

And it's unclear how much they buy me.

Okay.

So it sort of answers the question of sometimes parties

build differentiate Differentiated brand names.

Uh, it uses a model of sort of costly signalling,

right?

I mean, that's what we have for some politician.

It's more costly to signal, uh, the type by joining

a particular party so they don't join it.

So those who join it manage to effectively signal the

private differences in its cost.

Okay.

So the endogenous labels of the parties, the meaning of

the labels of the parties are created endogenous.

Okay.

So I think it's a very nice idea.

It's I think it's not a perfect implementation of the

idea because the signal is a bit adhoc and would

be nice to understand better the mechanism, but it's a

very nice.

I mean, this idea that the policy space is bounded

or the preference space is bounded is heavily used in

the literature.

That you know what are the bounds and actually do

other bounds moving with time.

It's something that we should probably think about.

Okay.

So move to the next one.

Is there a question.

Okay.

So the idea of this paper again if hopefully you

remember the citizen candidate model and the citizen candidate model.

Politicians can only run with the idea.

What do you say?

And the problem is that when you.

You have no commitment vis a vis the voters.

Right.

Idea is that it's very hard for voters to punish

you if you deviate.

So hence, I don't have commit.

The idea here is that if you have different politicians,

okay, running together in one party.

They still don't have commitment.

Each of them vis a vis the voters.

Okay.

But a party is a small group of people.

And within the party, you can imagine that we can

create commitment vis a vis each other.

So this is politician, and this is politician B, and

we run together in the party.

There are party mechanisms that allows me as a to

monitor P and P can monitor a okay.

Which means that when the two of us run together,

voters know that potentially we can implement policies on our

part of certain contracts.

Okay.

So what parties do here is sort of simply create

a larger set of policies that they can offer to

voters.

If they're composed of sort of a faction.

And also it implies that if B runs together with

A, she has one set of policies that you can

offer to voters.

But if she runs, we see it's a different set

of policies.

So that may tell us something about which parties we're

going to.

We are going to see.

But at its heart, it's simply an sort of an

extension of the citizen model.

Besides looking at only sort of domestic independent, you know,

politicians, we can look at coalitions of politicians and extend

this assumption that, you know, again, none of us or

the party as a whole has no commitment to the

voters, but the voters realise that we can commit vis

a vis we're having we are, first of all, we

look at each other.

We have very good information on how we vote in

committees, and also we can monitor each other and the

mechanisms like party whips and.

Uh.

And, um.

Primary primaries with a fixed list.

So that if you don't abide by your commitment, then

you are thrown out of the you are deselected.

Okay.

So you're not going to.

Okay.

So I have some discussion of so.

Okay.

So let me have this sort of the general discussion.

So it sort of relies on the idea that there

is party discipline.

Okay.

Um.

So it used to be the case that it didn't

really fit American parties because parties, a lot of politicians

didn't vote according to party line.

But sort of this changed a lot in the 90s.

I think Newt Gingrich, uh, sort of had sort of

a big speech.

And from then on.

Essentially the form of polarisation that we see in the

US is actually because politicians are actually voting according to

party.

Um, but that was not the original idea of of

Representatives in Congress.

They were supposed to represent their constituencies more than the

party.

Maybe they're also more accountable to Interscope, rather to the

own parties.

But there's also close links in the US between between

these two.

In European parties, there is typically a greater deal of

party cohesion.

Okay.

Party discipline.

Um.

If you think about how parties were formed.

Parties in England and France, sort of the result is

the members of parliament were essentially trying to collude.

That's how parties were formed.

Uh, so they had to create a mechanism to to

enforce collusion.

There is an influential paper by Keith Gravel.

I think his idea is to say you can see

a lot of collusion between party members.

But, you know, every basic game theory, repeat the game,

tell us that collusion can be enforced implicitly.

We still have a party institution.

So it has to be that the party does more

than a repeated game.

Uh, abusive behaviour.

Right?

Which is again collusive behaviour.

We don't need an institution.

So we.

So we said we need to Somehow make a distinction

between a party behaviour and a party like behaviour, which

is this implicit implicit equilibrium.

So it's important to think about the explicit mechanisms that

exist in parties that may be in this case are

for commitment.

There may be other mechanisms.

Okay.

So in European parties you have platforms that are chosen

in manifesto, chosen in conferences.

Um, it's very important you you hear in the news

recently if politician wants to do something that was not

in the manifesto, people remind her that it's not okay.

Or if you go against the manifesto, it's a big

deal.

Okay.

So it seems to be taken seriously by voters, of

course, up to a degree, but much more seriously by

voters compared to elections in the US.

Okay.

So the manifesto itself is something that you're supposed to

commit to and and and implementing.

Of course, you never do it properly.

And then you say, okay, conditions have changed.

I found out that, you know, the hole in the

budget is much bigger than we thought.

We need to change stuff, but you need to explain

so it's not the case.

Has anyone done a model which looks at parties as

a mechanism for finding competent politicians?

Um.

Yeah.

So there is a paper by McCarthy and Marino.

It's called, uh, career politicians or politicians or something like

that.

Uh, where what they have is parties sort of identifying

competent politicians, which then signals to the market.

So they'll talk about the relationship between parties and markets.

So if you are just a career politician.

If you just want to come to politics as part

of your career, not you're not intrinsically motivated.

Okay?

Being politically active in the party is something that can

signal to the outside market that you're not just going

to work.

So again, given this idea that a lot of people

start being engaged politically, you know, our young, you know,

student unions, for example, and then the party can learn

a lot about them.

Okay.

So without those that are not competent enough.

So stay in the party.

And then after a while they decide to move on.

So that's one paper.

Um.

And then the the papers of the dimension of the

wall, uh, that, uh.

Sort of.

You know, you know, which politicians are competent or not,

and you have to put them into primary.

So these are essentially the primaries is is a process

that allows you to select qualifications.

Explanation.

Okay.

So just an example to to show you why parties

think that platforms are important right.

So for example, you, you know, you have uh in

the party conference you vote about elements of manifesto.

So one example in the Labour Party in the 80s,

they reduced the voting power of the.

Units.

Because they want to have more centrist party policies in

order to fight back.

Okay.

So if you don't take seriously the manifesto, it's not

important to reduce the voting power of the union.

You can come out with policy, whatever is more leftist,

because you think that vote is maybe whatever you think

about it.

Okay, so this this tells you that you really think

that whatever you vote for in the manifesto is important

to voters.

So you signal to a degree or signal that this

is what you're going to do by changing the policy.

Okay.

So it seems that, you know, there is some commitment

parties that allow for lets parties allow for.

Uh, again, the question is maybe interest groups can provide

this.

It's it's probably harder for interest groups to see exactly

what politicians do in committees in parliament.

Uh, and maybe punishing those that deviate from the agreement

is maybe also harder, for it is still possible.

Okay.

But, uh, for example, when the primaries are closed, when

you when you select a list of candidates and you

can deselect people that just can't do it, they can

give more or less money, maybe higher or lesser endorsements

that the country selected.

Okay.

So I'm going to go to the to the model.

Uh, in this model.

Also in the previous one, the aim is also to.

Somehow endogenous uh endogenous.

Okay.

So trying to understand which parties are formed, which again

in most political economy model you would have fixed parties.

Okay.

So the general environment is as follows.

Okay.

So there are n groups in society.

Okay.

Each group can have a continuum of orders.

And I'm going to look at the multidimensional policy space.

Okay.

So there is some policy space.

Um.

And I'm going to think as usual about single pick

preferences.

So the ideal policy of group I.

Is noted for simplicity by I.

So we have some utility that is a function of

your ideal policy and the platform that is selected.

Okay.

So Q here is the policy space platform queue.

And if this is my ideal policy to have some.

Indifference curve that goes with the policy.

The further away this policy.

Okay.

So these are the voters preferences.

So just a assumption for simplicity that the set of

players, the politicians is just one representative from each group.

Okay.

Because I want to focus on, you know, politicians from

different preferences coming together in one party.

So there is no need to think about more than

one representative from each group.

And as in the citizen countries model, what they have

is their ideological preference.

That is why they cannot commit to more than their

own ideal policy if they run by themselves.

Okay.

So we're going to do the analysis in two stages.

One stage I'm going to assume a fixed partition of

politicians into parties okay.

So if I have a politician.

You know, A.

B and C.

Today.

Okay.

So maybe A and B are together.

So that will be a partition of the positions.

In the first stage I'm going to assume that this

is fixed and analyse the election okay.

Given that this is fixed.

And then in the second stage we will try to

think about what they are going to be stable parts

and equity pieces.

So we're going to do two stages for each partition.

We're going to understand what happens in this game.

Game that is played across parties okay.

The partition in which each of them runs by himself.

That's the citizen right?

We can choose whether to run or not with their

own idea policy.

That is candidate model.

So now we extend to look at.

Okay.

Roughly describing the model that when we have these correlations

more generally, you know, again, each correlation can also be

a single layer.

Okay.

Um, the coalitions choose platforms on which the voters vote

early.

The platform that receives the highest number of votes is

implemented.

So a very simple electoral game.

And in the first phase we will analyse all the

possible equilibria and then we determine which.

Which.

Participants.

Okay.

So now I'm going to describe the platform game or

the electoral competition game given that we have an application.

So we have a set of players that is organised

in a in a partition structure denoted by.

Right.

Uh, so a coalition is a nonempty subset of players.

And one assumption, which, you know, I'm sure, uh, you

you fully understand.

Remember, Q capital Q was the set of the policy

space, the set of policies that are available or reasonable

or exist?

And now.

I'm.

Denoting by q s as the parameter set of coalition

s.

So all the policies such that there is no other

policy.

Okay.

There is no other policy that can improve.

So given.

So a particular policy is in the set of ABC.

If there is no other policy inside or outside, it

is a method that can improve the utility of everyone.

A, B and C compared to Q.

And one of them strictly at least strictly closer to

one.

Okay.

So we can define the paradox.

Okay.

That's a standard.

Okay.

Essentially this is the assumption about the role of parties

voters belief that any policy in the Pareto set.

Can be backed by some voting protocol, like, you know,

the voting in the conference party.

Okay.

And enforcing coordinate mechanism.

Okay.

So hence, you know, if we are in a party

together, we can choose any policy in authority set or

choose not to have policies outside authorities.

And voters understand that we cannot commit to the right

because we would all agree to move to something better

after the election.

Okay.

Policies inside the parentheses.

There will always be one player that would block a

deviation.

Right.

And so we can.

It's the largest set that we can come into.

Maybe you know maybe what is the standard.

There are more restrictions for it might be okay but

it's the larger settings.

The idea is that we really compete with each other

and voters understand.

So it's not really committing to voters.

There's no commitment with the voters because the voters can't

punish.

It's very difficult for voters to be able to commit

to each other as voters in this case.

Okay.

So obviously the feasible set of policies differs for each

For, for different conditions.

Right?

Um.

Okay.

So the platform game is very simple.

The notation here is a bit heavy, but let me

just.

Just.

Without the notation or let me just mention the notation

that is important.

So each correlation is chosen simultaneously as in the citizen

candidate model a platform in its parental set or not

run okay.

So they don't have to run.

And then we're going to have given this first stage

in which they choose, uh, the particular platforms.

When I say platform, I include not running as a

platform.

So I'm going to call it Q of Pi two

Pi is the partition.

And cost Pi is the vector of policies that each

coalition in the in this partition is offering.

And then voters are just going to vote in Syria,

okay.

So they don't have to vote for their representative.

They vote for the policy that they like most.

Okay.

And then this is the bullet point.

Uh, last bullet, penultimate bullet point just says that the

winner of the election is the platform with the largest

number of votes.

There may be ties.

So you just solve them equally.

Okay.

That's it.

So now I can compute the utility of each politician.

Okay.

So it's very straightforward.

So for each politician I given a particular vector of

policy distribution I know what is the utility.

They care about policy.

Let's say there are no ties.

So just one policy is elected.

So they can compute their utility from from this vector

of policies.

Okay.

So this is probably the simplest environment of a political

game.

But you can think about vector of platforms voters votes.

Sincerely.

We know which policy is elected and we can compute

this.

We've introduced a lot of structure here, but ultimately we

just end up with like a coalition game.

Yes.

Yeah.

It's going to be a little bit more structure okay.

It's coalition game.

So we need to think about.

What are the what are the issues here okay.

So again exploitation exploitation.

We need to somehow choose together in a coalition a

policy that is best response to what other coalitions are

often.

Okay.

Now there are no preferences for the party.

The party as a as a coalition we don't currently

define.

So it's a model with incomplete preferences for the players.

The players are the parties, but the parties.

You know I like something better than Alex.

And Alex.

Doesn't.

Like it.

What does it mean?

How do we compare across this option?

Right.

Okay, so we need to we need to think about

what's the equilibrium notion that we're going to use when

we think about the equilibrium in the game between the

coinage.

What we want most is to make sure that we

have an equilibrium.

Okay.

So I'm going to think about the most permissive equilibrium

motion okay.

The most permissive equilibrium notion is the one that allows

for or blocks as much deviation as possible.

And essentially what it does is give for each member

of a collision.

It gives a veto power if the coalition wants to

be.

Okay.

So what I'm saying is that an equilibrium in the

platform game is a collection of these platforms.

Okay?

For each coalition platform, the platforms have to be independent

or set or not running.

So an equilibrium is denoted by q star.

And it is an equilibrium.

If we cannot find the coalition and another platform in

the priority set or not running okay, that is different

than what they offer in equilibrium, such that everyone prefers

to deviate to this new policy.

Q Prime again, and someone you know may be all

weakly, but at least one person who is a strict

with a strict, uh, motivation to do it.

Okay.

So we cannot find such person.

So it means that for whatever candidate different policy that,

uh, we suggest to deviate to, there is always someone

that says, hey, I don't want to deviate to reduce

my team, but okay.

So it means that within the coalition, a single player

can block a degree.

So like I said, at the end of the day.

What.

I think I think is okay.

Is this.

Clear?

So if we're most permissive about blocking deviations, we can

actually guarantee an equilibrium.

So that's the first result.

We might have too many.

Awesome, right.

It's the yeah.

Okay.

And I'm assuming a tie breaking rule, which helps, uh,

reduce a bit the number of equilibria.

So if the correlation I was planning to offer some

platform, but given what everyone has, the outcome will be

exactly the same.

If I don't try.

Okay, then.

Then don't try.

Okay, so this is just.

I forgot.

I'm sorry.

Yeah.

Okay.

So so far, you know, besides the fact that I'm,

you know, uh, yeah.

You don't have to think about politicians.

You can think more generally about other environments.

The thing is that in most economic environments, actually, for

example, if you think about, uh, if this would be

a corner competition and, uh, we form cartels, okay.

In most economic environment, we are sort of guaranteed a

unique equilibrium condition.

Okay.

Uh, and they just maximise their, their joint welfare.

So.

So what is the coalition preferences is quite known.

I think it was the economic environment.

Uh, here of course we can describe them in the

policy space, but not not you know, you can say

I'm not really aggregating here.

When it's about money and you have transferable skills, it's

easy to say, okay, we just maximise profit of the

coalition and the whole cartel and we divide it.

That's how.

We think about.

Things.

Uh, so it's easy to think about the coalition.

Preferences.

And, and also typically what you get is given a

partition you get in.

Here it's a bit more complicated.

I really haven't described, uh, preferences for the corner.

So this is the bargaining set.

This is, uh, this the parentheses.

That says this is sufficient constraints.

Uh.

I don't know.

Okay.

Okay.

So let's just, let's just think of a couple of

examples of to see how this this is working.

Truly the simplest example that, uh, we can think about.

Let's think about, you know, one dimensional policy space group

A, group B, group C, okay.

And yeah.

So the politician a politician B, politician C let's say

they have symmetric single preferences okay.

So you can see that.

So the first partition to analyse is the cities of

candidate one okay.

And so each of them can only offer each politician

only for the ideal policy okay.

So what do we do with the citizen model.

Again, there is multiplicity of equilibrium, but we can think

about one person running for election, two people running for

election, three people.

Okay, let's say that, you know, none of these groups

has a majority.

Okay.

So to win, you need at least two groups of

voters to.

To.

Support you compared to others.

Okay.

Um, the unique there are no cost of running here.

No benefit from running besides your ideological utility.

Okay, so here it's clear for one person running for

election excluded the median voter, which is B.

That's the only possibility, right?

Because if C if she runs along, then becomes better

and better.

And if she runs along the B runs along, nobody

can.

Okay.

So that's a simple.

So this is for one person running uh, if B

and C.

Run.

Here, I'm using the tiebreaking rule.

Okay.

B is winning because she gets also the vote of

A.

So then C should drop out.

Okay.

So there's no point for seat one right.

Okay.

So two people running for election.

It cannot be the.

So one is going to win here.

And then the other person drops.

If A and C are running is winning and then

C should drop okay.

If I and B are running then.

B's.

Winning and I should drop.

If all of them run for election then one group

will win the largest group.

Okay, so then again the others, at least one of

the others should drop.

For example, if B is not if if says winning,

if all of them are running and C is the

largest group, so C is winning.

So the voters vote.

In theory they are represented here right.

If CS winning then A should drop so that we

would win.

Uh, if A is winning, then she should drop.

So let me.

Okay, so that's the.

That's the basics.

So is this clear from the top.

Okay.

So just three politicians.

So it's, uh, simple to think about the correlations.

Maybe A and B are together and again see okay.

That's one feasible correlation structure.

Okay.

So this is just practising the definition here.

So.

So if, if C is running.

Okay.

It has to be that A and B together prefer

to run.

Okay.

For example with the idea policy B okay.

But even with the ideal policy of A both of

them prefer it to the idea policies.

Okay.

So there is no way that C will run because

they can win against C and they should win against.

Okay.

So because B is closer to A than to see

in fact all these policies okay.

All these policies could be an election outcome.

Okay.

And.

If B and C are running together.

Okay.

B and C are running together.

A very analogous argument would give us this set of

policies as the policies.

So it's not all of the apparatus set now.

Right.

The subset of that.

So the part of it becomes this subset of the

apparatus set.

Okay.

Such that both of them prefers this to a.

And then voters will vote for this.

Okay.

Um.

But if c suggests the deviation, for example, to this

policy, then B blocks it.

Right.

So each of these each of these is an equilibrium.

Why?

Because if he wants to move in this direction she

says no.

Okay.

They're both winning compared to a.

But if we move inside this screen set one of

us blocks the deviation.

Okay.

So this gives us the multiplicity which is not great.

But at least we can go for the general.

Okay.

So that is.

And again if she suggests the deviation to here actually

both of us will be right.

Because if we deviate here is.

So we cannot have an equilibrium in which the coalition

BC offers a policy here, because either A is not

running.

If this is an equilibrium, A is not supposed to

run, but then is not responding, so it should run.

If A is running, then is winning and then the

coalition is not responding.

They should move to something.

Okay.

Okay.

Tomorrow um coalition structures so we can think about A

and C running together.

Okay.

We can think about and see running together and then.

Any ideas what's going to be the outcome.

So they can offer everything on this line.

They can also be.

They can only offer B, so the the outcome will

be the ideal policy of Be.

So it's either be running with be okay.

And.

Then the coalition cannot offer something which would improve the

utility of both of them.

Okay.

So they might as well not run or a C

of B.

Right.

And then there's no point for B to run.

Okay.

So let's say that the outcome is B.

I guess we.

Can also think of the grand coalition and coalition.

Everyone in the coalition.

Together.

Okay, fine.

I mean, everybody seems good.

Okay, let me do a two dimensional example.

And just try.

To figure.

Out.

Okay.

Let's say that this is so.

What do we think about when we think about two

dimensions?

Let's give it some context.

Let's say that this is tax okay.

So tax can go from 0 to 1.

But what can you do with this tax.

Uh revenues.

You can either in a one dimensional policy space essentially

give it via general distribution.

Right.

So it's just one dimension.

You just choose tax and the tax revenues are redistributed.

In more than one dimension I can think about doing

different things with the tax.

So either I move everything to general distribution or I

have some special interest group that maybe wants their own

special stuff.

Okay, it could be a geographical interest group.

So they really need the hospital building their area as

well.

Or maybe it's a particular ethnic group that want their

language school or some religious group that wants.

A.

Financial assistance in building some, or having some justification and

so on.

Okay.

So essentially, you know, the policy space now becomes a

triangle.

So for any particular tax level, if I go all

the way on the Y dimension, I give all the

tax revenues to these special goods.

Okay.

If I remain here everything goes to general distribution.

And the points here represent some division of the tax

revenues between the general good and the special right.

So here A and B this is their ideal policies.

They don't care at all about the special interest.

They don't get to infer from this.

See I'm putting it as a group that wants full

taxation.

So C would probably care also about some general.

So a poor group think about poor with special interest.

This is sort of a general rule.

Everyone has their own interest, but.

In.

General poor.

And this would be the rich.

Okay.

So let's stick with the type of policies that we

have here, which also.

So here uh, we had group B preferring A to

C.

Okay.

So how is it going to look like.

Uh.

Right.

That's sorry.

That's the ideal policy.

So.

Okay.

So the indifference curve of group B that goes through

A gives them a better, higher utility than their indifference

curve.

It goes.

It's actually linear, right?

Because they only care about well, they may care about

minor okay.

And group C because they're poor.

So you know they should prefer this particular point.

So this is zero zero.

No taxation, no money for uh.

Special interest groups.

This is one zero for taxation.

No money for special interest group.

And this is one you know something?

Okay.

Some money to interest groups.

Maybe not all the money.

So maybe, you know, maybe group C is here.

It doesn't matter.

So that's it.

You know, this group has all the money, the ideal

policies that all the money goes to them.

Uh, but still they prefer this to that.

Okay.

Because also.

There.

Are different groups that go through these activities.

Okay.

And of course I prefer B2C because with general distribution

they get something back.

So that's, uh.

I think I mentioned that.

Something.

That distinguishes sometimes an economist and political scientist is that

sometimes we look at the multi dimensional policy space as

a triangle that represents some budget constraints.

For political scientist you could easily have two dimensions that

are not related.

Okay.

So it's a square.

Okay.

So for example you know this this is tax and

this is your preferences on you know so maybe cultural.

I think in real life a lot of it is

sort of mixed because, you know, I have a pure

cultural preferences but also cultural preferences can be related to

economic issues.

Right.

I mean, if you are going to support another language

program.

It's costing excellent resources for.

All of us.

But let's stick.

To the economic environment.

Okay, so all of this introduction to analyse again the

four, uh.

The four types of competition.

And if each of them runs by themselves.

Okay.

So if each of them run by themselves again, this

is the medium for me because she prefers me to

a and I prefer this.

Okay.

So again we're going to have.

To wait.

Okay.

If A and B run together.

Again not super interesting.

So the fact they they can run with all these

policies.

Right?

This is the priority for all of these policies.

Uh, so you cannot win against any of this.

So if C is running, they must offer a policy.

And the policy has to be different set at each

of these policies.

So within the parentheses there could be no deviations outside

the policy set.

So they are not necessarily winning.

And also they cannot.

Okay.

So we have again this.

Policy the.

Whole parentheses of in B.

Uh if B and C run together.

These policies.

Right.

So sorry what is a median voter AP.

The median voter is B because she C prefers b

to A and I prefer.

All right.

But that's the entire.

Yeah I'm just keeping.

As close as possible.

I mean that's the economic model behind it.

That, uh, economic model behind it is that, you know,

if you're poor, you're better off with some general distribution

compared to them.

Okay.

So again, we can support an equilibrium.

All these policies that can win against it okay.

So a subset of it to say that we can

get a and the final coalition that I'm going to

analyse uh and see AMC.

Okay, so now the results are going to be different

than what we had in the one dimensional case okay.

But the two dimensional case is doing here is allowing

some give and take between ANC.

Okay.

So I described the indifference curve of C that goes

through B right.

And we can.

Describe the indifference curve of A.

That goes for me.

Okay.

So utility of a increases in this direction.

Utility of C increases this direction.

Okay.

Now we see that we have a set of policies.

So first of all we have to describe the characteristics

of A and C okay.

But let's give it some concavity.

Okay.

The current state of NC is going to be the

contractor here.

Right.

So the tangency of this indifference curve.

So there's going to be colours.

Okay.

So there's going to be some contract curve right.

That would represent tangency.

Okay.

So that's the feasible set of policies.

And okay there is now potentially you know you need

to you need to have some concavity okay.

If it's linear and goes in the opposite direction you

will have nothing.

Okay.

In other words the Pareto set could potentially be here.

Okay.

But if there is some concavity then the parameter set

will be here.

And then we have policies that are better for both

of them compared to.

Okay.

If this is the case then this set of policies

is the winning set policies.

Against speech.

So be running alone is not an equilibrium in this

given this partition.

Because A and C can instead of.

Okay.

So this gives us the sort of hope that.

But, um.

You know, parties can have a role here and change

and change the political outcome that will exist without parties.

Three without.

So here also they change the outcome.

Okay.

So in both of these cases they change the outcomes.

But here it seems a bit strange now that, uh,

B is willing to go with A so that, you

know, you can get something worse than if he's by

himself here.

If A and C are not together, they are not

going to be able to get this.

Okay.

So this is a sort of an agreement of you

know, what is the compromise here?

The rich are compromising on tax.

So they're giving tax but not as high as all

the poor ones.

Okay.

So they lower the tax level compared to the voter

okay.

And they give some of the tax revenues to especially.

Okay.

So this is the special interest compared to to this.

The special interest is getting something and the rich are

getting the rich are getting a lower tax burden.

And the poor are gaining some, uh, some of their

special.

Okay.

Yes, I have another.

What is the logic that the contract curve is only

between A and C and not be.

The coalition is ANC.

Now thinks it.

Will be a coalition.

Ehm.

Um.

So when A and B were together, this was the

contract curve, right.

It was pretty obvious.

Yeah.

And when BNC are together, this is the contract here.

Okay.

When A and C are together.

Okay.

Unless we are in a situation, there could be a

situation in which the contract curve of, uh, a looks

like.

This.

And C looks like this.

Okay.

And then the Pareto set will actually include B I

don't know if you can see and will be here,

but if you have some concavity it's not going to

look okay.

Okay.

So so in particular in the preferences of C over

the special good.

You could put public good.

You could put some good gravity.

And then the contract between A and B you have

to have like linear preferences.

Right okay.

Tangentially free the contour curve between A and B.

Yeah.

If it's if it's the line then it's linear.

It's fine.

That would be the contour right.

He enjoys this is just tax right.

Yeah.

So depending on these prices.

Okay.

So so we need to so we sort of understood

something.

And then it's important to think, you know, can we

really implement this or does maybe we have some bargaining

power, uh, so that, you know, it doesn't want to

be in collusion on this, uh, sort of which, which

politicians survive?

If we think more seriously then the ability to form

coalitions.

Right.

So far we fix the coalitions.

But we think that.

Okay, so.

Let me take a break.

We made it a quarter to.

22.

Okay.

Then do you want.

The product.

I'm going to get it.

Yeah.

Copy.

Oh, hi.

Sorry.

You need us.

Downstairs.

Do you want to grab a coffee?

Yeah.

Yeah.

I mean, if you want.

But.

But maybe.

But maybe I will put my jacket on.

This is kind of cool.

Don't be like.

So cool to us.

Yeah.

Oh.

And taxes, right?

So, um.

Yeah.

So.

Yeah.

Come back.

Are you ready for your book?

Yes, sir.

Okay.

This is good.

I love it because I don't have no idea what

it is.

It's easier.

It's like, um.

So I was talking.

About that with my friend, actually.

And.

Yeah, this work is.

Done, actually.

It's been made into a movie as well.

I completely forgot about that.

Even though I have some possibility.

But I hope you like it.

You know, it's like, okay.

I have to be.

Like.

No, thank.

You.

Okay.

Is that right?

Yeah.

I think.

It's doing that.

Um.

So.

Yeah.

That's great.

Thank.

You.

Thank you so much.

He's so cool.

I already know it.

Here.

Yeah.

It's totally.

Nice.

Yeah.

This is the second.

Series for each other.

Yeah.

There's so exactly the.

There's, like a much.

But the me, this is easier compared to a novel.

Yes.

Let's see.

This also because I say that I can read in

French, but then I type in the second word.

Dialogues.

Yes.

And.

Yes, I think.

We trust the other.

I hope so.

Um.

Okay.

I know.

Yes.

It's a good day.

No, no, I prefer this.

Yes.

Uh, I read about the ten minutes and I don't

know why.

This.

Thing.

We just want to go there for some reason, to

buy it.

Because it's in such a cool city.

Like right now.

Of course, like the vibes of Beirut are.

Yeah.

So we're really.

But but I would also maybe try to understand why

exactly this.

Or do.

I don't have to pay too much.

No, no, I think it's because it wasn't.

Until I saw his name on the ad, I was

like, oh.

And then like going like back into my mind.

I was like, yeah, like, his name is really good.

I was like, okay.

It was more like it.

was like, this is not.

This is.

That.

So this evening, I think.

That.

I think those are my comments.

Right.

That's right.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

I think this is super cool.

And I was like yeah.

Yeah.

No okay.

Oh really.

Good.

Interpretation.

Okay okay okay.

Oh what did she want to tell me.

Oh my god.

You should be worried.

Yeah.

It didn't scream okay.

It's a good story I think.

Thank you so much.

We're going to start the event like today.

Okay.

Now I have, Now I have a Spanish and, uh.

Uh.

Thank you.

Yeah.

Huh?

Yeah.

Yeah.

I have a Spanish book and a French book in

my pocket.

This is good.

And who's about to do us right?

Sorry.

Yeah.

Come on.

Okay.

Do you want it?

Like, if.

Depends on whether you prefer to spend the rest of

the extra money in your book or just before for

me to present.

It to others?

No.

Yeah.

You need to put it in the fridge.

Yes.

But don't let anyone say.

It's fascist.

Okay.

So we've.

We got used to understanding one of the equilibria when.

We have a particular, uh.

Solution structure.

What are the challenges if we're trying to look for

stable correlation, what correlation will form?

Uh.

So as I mentioned, this is a game.

In.

Which.

There is for each player there is value for being

in a particular correlation.

But this value depends on the other correlations that are

there.

Right.

So the room in which the platform is winning, but

also it's a bit complicated because even when I'm.

Okay.

It's hard to see it with just three, but even

when I left it there for groups.

Okay, so even given I'm a given, the let's say

the even when I'm assessing the value from this petition,

it may depend on the equilibrium that we are playing.

As you can see, there is also multiplicity of equilibrium.

Uh, so it's very hard to use of non-cooperative concepts

to think about bargaining.

So if I go to the coalition together, that depends

on what, uh, Law and Alex are deciding in their

coalition, which we don't know about.

Okay.

So, um, so I'm going to use a particular type

of stability concept.

Okay.

And the stability concept says as follows.

So first I'm not only looking for a correlation structure

in this table.

I'm looking for a party structure and the equilibrium, because

it could be that a particular partition is stable if

we decide on implementing, let's say the D policy here,

but it is not stable if we decide to do

something else.

Right.

So we can't really only think about because there are

multiplicity of security, we can't really think only about the

partition structure table.

We have to think about the coalition structure and the

equilibrium that we look.

Okay.

So yeah sorry.

That's because we come transfer utility.

We come to our third thing.

Yeah.

Right.

So you can't just use cool.

Which, which, which uh you know in some political applications

you can think it's feasible.

Maybe the extreme assumption about politics is that, uh, money

is not oiling the system enough.

Okay.

Um, so the solution concept is as follows.

We look at the partition structure and an equilibrium outcome

within this partition structure.

And we say this table if we cannot find.

An entity here.

We cannot find a sub coalition here okay.

That can break.

So when it breaks we have a, B, C, D

and E.

But.

What do they think will happen when they break.

Now there is a different party structure.

And now maybe they cannot offer any more what they

offered before.

And he definitely can only offer the And therefore you

see.

So if we break, we need to think about the

new equilibrium.

So there cannot be a sub coalition that will break.

And so that for the new partition there is an

equilibrium that these two prefer one of the three.

And the paper this one is more involved.

So it's actually you cannot deviate to anything that is

not stable in itself.

So it's a recursive definition.

But let's forget about this.

Just think about one deviation.

Yes.

I think a.

Little confused about the contract.

Yeah.

Okay.

That we were saying that in the first part, we're

saying it could be, you know, like if A and

C are major collision, they're going to offer B or

anything, anything else.

And then we move to the contract curve and we

say that it was going.

To be the first stage.

What we did was to fix the partition.

Okay.

We fixed all this partition and we said, what is

the equilibrium?

Now I'm looking at this and I'm saying, well, which

partition is going to arise in equilibrium okay.

In the total equilibrium.

Okay.

So I'm putting a restriction on what partitions can arise

okay.

And I'm saying for example look at this partition.

Is it stable.

Okay.

Is this partition with a particular equilibrium outcome.

Let's say at this point okay.

So the point.

Here.

Okay.

Is it a stable partition or will it be broken.

And the solution concept that I'm using is to say

it is stable.

If we cannot find a sub coalition here.

Here it's either A or B.

It's.

Okay.

That can break their coalition.

Okay.

And when they induce a new partition.

So if, for example, one of them breaks we have

a b, c.

So we are here okay.

That can break and get a better outcome in the

resulting one okay.

So for each partition we have again we have a

solution concept that we know what's going to be the

utilities that you're going to get for a particular outcome

okay.

And now I'm saying ah I want to find something

that sort of governs which which partitions are stable.

Okay.

So I'm saying this is the concept I'm allowing you.

So the concept is composed of several assumptions.

First, I'm allowing you only to break coalitions rather than

form new coalitions okay.

Assuming that it's Potentially easier to break rather than create,

you know, or maybe Etsy and then or you know,

or be joining.

See, because then you need to form a new constitution.

Much more difficult way.

Okay.

The really reason why I'm doing it is that if

you allow all deviations okay, so now you know be

is leaving a and going to see you will never

find anything still never.

I mean generically speaking okay.

This is the problem that particularly in the multi dimensional

policy space the core is empty okay.

So I'm restricting the deviations.

So one is breaking second uh you sort of deviating

optimistically.

So you're thinking if I break and there is a

better outcome for me.

So there may be many outcomes, but I'm sort of

optimistically thinking about the best outcome for me.

That would happen when I break here.

It's not a problem.

There is only one outcome.

Okay, okay.

But, you know, uh, if we were in a coalition

together and B and C break, they will do it

for a better outcome.

You see, somehow imagine that this would be the outcome.

Uh, and I think that's it, huh?

That's sort of.

Okay, so note we are stabilising together a partition and

an equilibrium.

Okay.

So what I would only say is that given that

there are no transferable utilities, given that, uh, conditional games

are in general problematic, we have to compromise a little

bit.

And that's sort of a compromise in terms of trying

to find something that is stable.

If you put too many, too much ability to deviate,

nothing will be stable.

Okay.

So here, for example, it's sort of fixed that this

is stable because nobody can break anything.

So the citizen candidate model is stable okay by definition.

And then we can check are there other stable partitions.

The real question that we want to ask, are there

other stable partitions that will yield us a different outcome

than what the citizen candidate model?

If there are no other partitions that give us maybe

the other partitions, but they give us the same outcome.

Okay.

Maybe like you know, this one.

If so, if they give us the same outcome, this

role for parties to increase commitment is is is not

a meaningful reward okay.

But if they are.

Okay.

Then then.

So there are other stable partitions in equilibrium that give

us different outcome.

Then citizen candidate.

Then we can say, okay, uh, this role rule has

a meaning doesn't mean that that's what parties do, but

at least potentially could serve as okay.

The question.

Is, are you saying that it's a recursive definition as

well?

So in the paper it's a recursive deviation.

Because if you deviate to the let's do a.

So you're sort of forward looking in the following way.

So let's say we are a b c d e

f okay.

So they are planning to deviate.

They take into consideration that maybe following their deviation you

know and B will deviate.

So essentially the forward looking and they land up on

the next stable Stable rotation.

Okay.

So you can only deviate to something which is stable

in itself.

That's the recall scene.

Okay.

So given that we fix this stable there is going

to be always stable condition.

And this sort of anchors uh the recursive process.

So you find it recursively, you know, this stable.

Then you go to uh coalition structure with coalitions with

two members.

So.

So because if.

Concepts in both like the simultaneous breakdowns.

Like you can.

Think you can do a thought experiment, right, do a

thought experiment of a sequential, uh, that then sort of

if I deviate, I know that this will be and

then you go to the next, uh, finer partition from

this that will be.

So like B and C talks like each other, then

that's.

Fine because I'm only allowing breaking up or allowing drinks.

Yes.

Yes.

Yes.

So then if it's okay.

So in that situation then A and B are splitting

up.

Right.

Because they they are going to win.

I don't know why I mean the splitting because they're

better off.

Yeah.

But if they're.

Right there might be some of them winning together and

have half I don't know.

Yeah.

The better off you have to be.

Better off to split.

Yeah.

So.

But does that imply that they have to have a

chance of winning then.

Yeah.

Well, I don't know, because maybe when they're held together,

uh, this coalition wins with something which is really somehow

bad for them.

Right.

They can do nothing because somehow Z is blocking them.

And now this one is breaking.

And they offer something which is more attractive for A

and B, but still Z is blocking them so they

they can deviate so that you know, now that is

not blocking.

Take me to a different platform.

Yeah.

Somehow that platform.

And maybe when they split like that because of the

terror threats that they are offering, maybe it is offering

something else.

So it's not obvious that you.

Typically.

Speak to me.

Okay.

So so, you know, let's go over this again to

practice this.

So this is table that the median voter outcome here

A and B any outcome that is not be.

Okay.

Is destabilising this coalition because essentially the knows.

So this is like the bargaining power of B in

this coalition that forces this coalition to choose this ideal

policy.

Because they can tell I look, you know, I can

split the party.

And so, you know, it's a bit stark gets exactly

what you want, but I can split the party if

we don't offer this, okay.

It's a credible threat.

So the the bargaining power within the coalition is essentially

modelled by the ability to split.

And what you get later on not modelled in terms

of what negotiations we have here and what we're ending

on.

So in other words, you can say it in the

following way.

If the party protocol doesn't give full voting rights to

be a tool, and then essentially they choose a policy

that sort of nullifies the party department.

Right?

At this time, the only policy that can win is

the idea of policy.

Okay.

Otherwise, break this party and get.

Me out of this.

I'm trying to keep thinking.

I don't know what they like.

Sorry.

Um.

Okay, so what do we see here in the one

dimensional policy space?

We say that parties don't matter.

Okay.

Um, this seems special and unique to this example, but

this is not the case, okay?

The truth is more.

Involved, but, uh.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

So.

That's even think about the continuum.

Okay.

So now I'm going to show sort of roughly the

argument of why in one dimension this commitment power does

not change the set of equilibrium outcomes.

So maybe there are stable correlation structure because I didn't

assume any small cost or benefit from being in a

coalition.

But in terms of economic outcomes, you know, policy outcomes,

it will be the same as without the party structure.

Okay.

So let's say there is a median politician here okay.

So let's think of a continuum okay.

Okay.

So so you can think of different two types of

parties.

You can think about parties that are composed of people

from both sides.

Okay.

You can think of parties that are sort of more

homogeneous.

Only right wing people.

Okay, so here without parties, sort of.

It's the middle.

Um.

Or you could have an equilibrium, right?

You could have an equilibrium in which, for example, two

people are running around the media, uh, each of them

gets 50% and they are close enough for the median

creation.

Okay.

These are the types of equilibrium.

Let's think about parties that are sort of two sided.

So from both sides of the median okay.

Um so the parameter set is going to be something

like this right.

Whenever the policy is worse for one of them relative

to the media.

Okay.

Essentially they will they can break the party.

Okay.

And get to this, because the more interesting cases may

be the case that you can think about parties that

are two sided.

Party here and one party.

Okay.

The first point to say is I want to look

at this person, the most moderate in the right wing

party.

It has to be in equilibrium.

It has to be in equilibrium that these parties offer

the most moderate position.

Okay.

Let's think about this.

Why is that?

For both parties to actually run in the election and

get something, each of them must win with 50%.

Okay.

So the media must be indifferent between the two platforms.

If one of the parties offers something here and wins

with 50%, they can deviate a little to the left

just a tiny bit and win for sure.

It will be better for all of them compared to

this lottery.

Why?

Because currently we're assuming that the median is different between

these and these, right?

So the most left wing person, the most right wing

person, surely prefers a small deviation and win for sure

rather than this lottery.

Right.

Okay.

So that means that essentially, you know, you must be

at your most moderate position and win with probability of

okay, but then not really.

But then these two people can run by themselves.

They don't really need all the baggage around the party.

It's a little bit tricky because if there are parties

out there, similarly to what we discuss now, maybe when

the party is out that there is another party here

that sort of.

Blocks the meeting from entering or someone else.

So and they're just not to run.

So we have to be a little bit more careful.

There's a more argument involved, but the key intuition is

in the one dimensional, you can't have two sided parties

because they're not going to improve the utility of everyone

compared to the media.

Okay.

And whatever you implement with one sided parties, it's possible

to implement with just a single politician.

It has to be also in equilibrium when politicians are

not running in parties.

The commitment ability that these other members, the most extreme

member you give to the moderate guy, is not important

for the moderates.

He can run by himself if we have to run

with the most moderate position, and then it means that

the moderate can be by himself.

So this commitment ability, this baggage that the moderate person

is carrying with him, all this stuff is not is

not changing the outcome.

Okay.

So that's what's going on in the one dimension.

So it's the general is that it's not.

Okay.

So what happens in the in the political space.

Okay.

So again when they run by themselves it's B when

A and B run together.

The same argument, you know, B has to get what

you want because you can split.

And similarly when C and B run together.

But now if we look at the correlation of a

versus B, the same argument that allowed us to find

policies for this correlation that are better than being win

against B imply that ANC do not want to split.

So here we can have an example in which parties

change the change the outcome compared to the environment.

Indeed by sort of.

Using this give and take across the two dimensions.

Okay.

So it's sort of a more meaningful compromise compared to

what we have in the one.

And.

So.

And one way that I like to think about this

is as follows.

If I, if I draw some line here let's say

through the equilibrium outcome.

Okay.

And now I take this line and I just.

So this was B and this is the equilibrium outcome

of A and C okay.

So if you sort of look at the available parties

out there, it can look as if there is just

one dimension.

Of course.

Right.

This is like maybe left wing B government and the

general distribution.

And maybe this is right wing small government and uh,

some benefits to some specific groups.

Okay.

So maybe the BJP in India that, uh, sort of

rich together with uh, the Hindu, uh, religious, uh, public

and party in the US.

Okay.

So it looks like it's one dimension and empirically you

will observe.

If there is party discipline, you know, you will observe

that people are voting as if the conflict is just

one dimension.

The point here is to say that it actually could

be the parties that are mitigating the reducing the dimensionality

of the conflict.

Okay, this is not necessarily good or bad, but they

are reducing the dimensionality of the conflict to a point

in which, okay, from one dimension, we know you can

do much better than that, but they do this endogenously.

Okay.

So so and maybe it may change over time.

Okay.

So you know, what does the for example, maybe I

spoke about this in the first lecture, for example, in

the, you know, the Democratic Party was the one that

used to be against civil rights.

Okay.

You know, there used to be more pro-slavery than the

Republican Party, okay, in the 1860s, whereas in the 1960s

it got to be the.

Video.

Okay, so how the parties somehow combine the different dimensions

together is is endogenous.

We are used to the left left wing economically to

be more in favour of human rights.

But you know, even in the UK in the 30s,

if you think about the Keynesians, they were supporting a

Gen-X, they were supporting a very centralised system, controlling human

rights.

Okay.

And so.

You know, dimensions of conflict can be realigned by the

parties and, and, and mitigated by the parties or reduced

by parties according to the compromise.

That could, could change over time.

And it is something that so there is the data.

When you look at the voting of congresspersons and senators

in the US.

So this is done by a Very substantial data analysis

by Paul and Rosenthal, and their prediction is that mostly

you could explain everything by one dimension of columns.

Okay.

So you could interpret this in two ways.

Is that truly there is one dimension of confidentiality okay.

Or you can interpret it by saying that what the

parties do is essentially reduce the dimensionality of conflict internally.

Okay.

And what you see is the observed votes that come

from the fact that we are members of the party.

And then and then it looks one dimensional, but it

may be endogenous process that creates this.

In the paper, there is a general characterisation of conditions

for when parties would matter.

Roughly.

It's similar to the example.

Yes.

Do they compare that against like you can?

No, I was gonna say algorithms, but no, no, no.

This was done in the 80s and 90s.

Because I you could compare it against like PCA, like

SVD for dimensionality reduction.

So can you see where the parties.

I think they.

Just tried to add more dimension to see if there's

an explanatory power in the regression.

So I think they do some structural okay.

Yeah.

It might be interesting to to repeat this.

So it's more sophisticated.

And interestingly there are some examples in which it doesn't

work.

So or or it collapses.

Whether we can be together in a party different factions

okay.

So for example I think Belgium is an example.

There were sort of the 40s and 50s and 60s

were along economic lines.

And within any party, both the left and right socialist,

uh, the two, the London and the Flemish cooperated with

the East and then the conflict, this particular conflict became

more salient.

60s and this collapsed.

Okay.

So they couldn't cooperate anymore in a time.

Okay.

So.

So here's I mean, very real.

So but here, for example, you know, if the, if

ANC are such that the preferences are like this being

the brothers that they cannot cooperate.

Um, it's not it's not an exponential.

But if something becomes too hard for us to compromise

on, we are not able to, to, uh, to sustain

this.

Uh, what other examples out there?

I mean.

Of course the dimensions themselves change over time.

Again, you know, 100 years ago in Europe, it was

sort of rural versus urban was a big economic dimension

of conflict.

I mean, it's still out there, but it's not, you

know, it's not very it's not very subtle to have

the farmers interested, but.

Uh.

You can think about the economic dimension, of course, being

very strong.

And then at some point we introduce the green dimension,

the environment.

Okay.

Um.

In some countries this was associated with left wing.

Okay.

In Germany, in some countries in England, in the beginning

it was associated very much with actually the countryside.

Ryan Thomas and.

The.

Um and then achieved.

Okay.

Okay.

So the general result here is that with more than

one dimensions, parties can be effective.

So they're not effective with one dimension in particular.

Okay.

So you have to be a bit careful when you

when you define more than one dimension.

Because if the distribution of preferences is such that, you

know, all the voters are here and here, essentially a

one dimension looks roughly two dimensions, but there is just

one dimension.

So you need to have an effective two dimensional conflict.

Then, even if a winner exists in the initial citizen

candidate expectation, uh, under some condition, if preferences are are

are Euclidean is just sufficient condition.

Parties are effective if.

If the if we have enough groups and not too

many to spend to spend the effective dimension okay.

So here two dimension and three groups I know for

sure.

If we can.

Get something effective here.

Okay.

So so this gives us also some idea of why

parties are sometimes changing.

The brand name is changing in the sense of, you

know, like democratic parties now associated more with human rights.

The brand name is changing because they actually, you know,

the preferences of the people there are are different.

Um, so this is something that political scientists talked a

lot about, sort of realignment of politics.

Sort of recently people are talking about realignment of politics

so that the left wing parties are not associated with

working class.

Okay.

I think it's a bit too extreme, but.

Policies are more in line with the educational and educated

voters versus non-edible voters compared to standard standard class.

Okay, within the context of this, you can think about

what happens when a new dimension is added to society.

Okay.

So you can think about established parties.

Okay.

So let's say A and B.

Okay.

And somehow either by you know often.

So that's also a debate in political scientists.

You know are politicians able to affect voters preferences.

Right.

Or are new dimensions rising?

Sort of.

Organically.

Okay.

So you think maybe.

Maybe I'm just.

Looking for my.

So maybe the environment dimension was very bright, right?

Organically.

Because things happen.

Uh, but I'm guessing that climate change deniers will say

that this is just a political ploy by by supporters.

Right?

So there could be different views on different things or

culture wars or all this stuff.

You know, it seems to be potentially strategically.

Uh, but let's say, let's say there is a new

dimension in the sense that there is a new party,

uh, or new group of voters that now has.

So this maybe was the standard tax and redistribute dimension.

Okay.

So you can have to establish parties here.

Um, And then there is a new group of voters

which has preferences different from all of this on a

new dimension.

Okay.

So certainly we care about the environment.

So there is a group of voters that cares about

the environment.

But this group of voters also has preferences on the

old dimension, right.

It's not, you know, something.

And so sort of the three group little toy model

that we did before can tell us, you know, are

we going to get movement on the new dimension and

what happens to the old dimension.

So again, the very toy example.

But you know, if, for example, this group, this new

group is close enough on the one on the new

dimension and sort of middle of the road on the

old dimension, It can potentially become the new median filter.

Okay.

Which may give us the prediction that actually now the

two parties are going to fight against this.

Okay.

Offer something middle of the road compromise on the economics

to fend off this new entry.

But if this group is, you know, coming into the

system and so doesn't doesn't change the fact that this

maybe this was winning and the poor were the majority.

Okay.

Now maybe we can have, you know, as we had

before, some correlation between.

The.

Losing form before.

And so this remains in voter.

And now we have this policy here.

So if you are a political entrepreneur and thinking about,

you know, where to locate your, your, uh.

Your new group.

So this tells us you have to think not only

about how extreme you want to be and new direction,

but you have to.

You know what?

At least what voters perceive about your policy.

What do you think about going to be the preferences

of the all dimension of the group that you coalesce

around you is going to be important to whether you're

going to be successful in the to do things and

only.

This may be placed to the what I said at

the beginning.

If you think only about the interest group, you really

can think about one dimension of conflict or one dimension

of of focus of the interest group.

But if we think about parties, you really have to,

you know, you cannot.

The Green Party has to say.

what are the policies for.

The.

Defence education?

Of course, they can all have, you know, can be

a cohesive manifesto, but it has to apply to other

voters.

Need to know what you're going to do on other

on other stuff.

So maybe this can give us sort of a good

way to think about the scope of interest group versus

party in the sense that, you know, if there is

no way to find compromise on the other dimensions among

the interest group, we can't really be a party.

Okay?

We can maybe just be an interest.

We can fight on the outside.

Uh, but if our ideas sort of have some cohesiveness

for other dimensions as well, then maybe, you know, maybe

it's better for us to have to form a party

instead.

The again, it's a toy model and I've shown you

some of toy results about sort of the combination of

richer voters and and special interest.

Uh, I think I've alluded to in the first lecture

to empirical literature, especially specifically property that shows no, no

differences in provision of public goods between democracies and non

democracy.

I think that democracies would provide more public good, but

then empirically showed that bundles all democracies together and all

non democracies together show that they're not.

But if you actually separate the data on democracies to

democracies that are, uh, a little bit more diverse and

a little less diverse, okay.

Then there is a difference.

In less diverse democracies, there is quite a lot of

general distribution.

In more diverse democracies, there is less general distribution and

more specifically, which makes sense.

Um.

This is not to say that we should be in

a non diversity is says more to it's important to

understand the mechanism.

Okay.

Uh and sort of it points to the fact that.

Yeah.

What is the salient conflict in society can come from

this endogenous bargaining could be potentially, uh, a the class

conflict.

So all the poor against the rich.

Or it could be that the poor are divided.

Maybe some rich also.

And and this endogenous coalition creates a situation which maybe

there is total less redistribution, but some goes to specific

groups that do things.

There is never a general poor.

Group like everyone has.

Uh, but if all the you know, if society is

very homogeneous, then the special interest of the poor is

also very similar.

You know, people have tried to explain it by.

So there is a survey paper trying to explain why

diverse democracies are providing less public general.

And.

A lot of explanations simply rely on sort of stuff

in your utility function that you know you you enjoyed

less when other groups that are not, you know, get

something.

Okay.

I think, you know, it's not, uh.

I mean.

Morally, it's like, you know, everything is is efficient if

we put it in the preferences, right?

Um, and also, it doesn't give us a lot of

useful things to work with and to think, you know,

how.

What's the.

Mechanism behind.

This.

What are you saying?

That just lump in in-group preferences as like primitive.

Yeah.

That would explain how those arise.

Because it can.

Explain.

For sure.

Yeah.

And also you.

Can do the opposite.

Right.

Assume also in the same way that people.

I mean you know, who knows.

Yeah.

How so if for instance we have an So like.

We we.

Had to dimension right.

And then we have like a coalition, for instance, as

we did before AC and B turns into one dimension.

And then there's a new, uh, party that comes in

right as we did.

Right.

And now we're again.

I think that we we need to think of the

three dimensions.

Right.

Because then there could be, again, this realignment.

Right?

Yeah.

Unless I think people speak about the process that is

going on now.

Uh, as so let's think about this endogenous one dimension.

And somehow people become so polarised that they have strong

preferences on these two dimensions, on all the topic, whatever

topic they come, you can somehow correlate it with one

of these.

And then I think disrupting it's sort of outside this

model.

It's some sort of a dynamic process that once.

We.

Are in this one dimension.

Because maybe because on one dimension, it's hard to find

a compromise with time we become yeah, people call it

affective polarisation, whatever we.

Somehow we bundle everything that come our way.

We bundle in the same way that that may be.

That may be how people think about what's going on,

what's going on now?

Uh.

But from the point of of the current model, I

would have to break this one dimension to think about

the three dimensional problem.

You could assume some persistence saying, okay, this these parties

are established.

So if the new dimension doesn't stabilise it too much,

this stabilise it too much, maybe, maybe it stays.

And then, you know, maybe the new group is absorbed

in, you know, goes to coalition.

One of them something of that.

Sort of.

Things.

But then also in these models, the parties, they come

in with their own preferences, that is just reflecting on

their own choice.

And so they just choose a policy so that it

is pretty efficient for the people in the party and

then not concerned at all with representing somehow any preferences

of the voters.

And then they just somehow they pick their platform and,

and they compete to get the attention of the voters.

Or is it.

Like the voters?

So the part that the politicians here are ideological, okay.

They come you know, I come from my group, so

it's the same group with the same preferences as my

group, okay.

And I'm maximising my utility in the sense of, you

know, so it could be that the coalition that I'm

in chose something that my voters are not going to

vote for it, but then it's either not an equilibrium

or I can break the party or, you know, it

could, uh, so potentially.

So just to make it more robust, I didn't tie

the voters that they have to vote for the representative,

but this would be the case in that case, okay.

Because otherwise they were presented with a bargain for something.

Uh.

So it's extreme here on the fact that political politicians

are fully ideological.

Okay.

You can add the cost of benefit of parties.

And for example, this party that runs with B, if

they are cost performing a party, that we will break

it if the benefit of being in a stable.

But if it's marginal.

If it's not marginal then B is willing to.

But then it's not about the commitment so much as

about the fact that we want to form a party

because there are increasing returns to scale.

So that's why I did it.

Uh.

I mean, it's extreme on other assumptions.

So when I started this, I thought, you know, it

could be a good way to compare.

Between.

This majoritarian system and my parliamentary.

System, but.

Just modelling parliamentary system, if there is not really a

very good way of doing that.

Okay.

Um.

But I think.

I think this issue of how we as a society

somehow so this fits into this idea that we, you

know, we start with factions or interest and then we

compromise some things in a faction and maybe some parties

go to coalition coalition government.

So we have sort of a range of bargaining environment

reduced the number of players bargaining somehow.

Uh.

And.

And also I think that the issue of multi dimensionality,

I think is really important in politics.

And it's not because it's, it is difficult to to

analyse.

So here I have to compromise on the stability concept

and it's difficult, but it's uh.

The political scientists call this uh, coinciding cleavages or signing

or not coinciding.

They have another way.

Um.

So if you have, for example, the square.

Okay.

So if you have four groups here like the.

Maybe let's let's cross-cutting.

Let's think about Northern Ireland okay.

So you have Protestants and Catholics.

And you have poor and rich.

Okay.

So if you have, you know, substantial representation of the

different of the really four groups maybe like in Belgium,

maybe could have done, uh, you know, maybe you could

have had an economic, uh, coalitions.

And so.

The.

The stronger salient dimension of, of uh, ethnic conflict or

religious conflict, um, conflict.

And, you know, maybe it would somehow work, okay, in

the sense that we could somehow compromise.

Okay.

But if we have, you know, all the Protestants are.

Rich.

And all the Catholic poor.

Which I think in general was good for the opposition.

Yeah.

Not all.

Of course not all, but okay.

So you really effectively you have a one dimensional.

So you have the versus Belgium.

Or you can.

Think about Belgium in the, you know, canonic dimension and

balloons and Flemish.

Once the conflict became more salient with, you know I

can't really do not know really how the mechanism works

on this, but it's a bit like this.

The difference groups that they describe in one dimension becomes

so important that I'm not willing to compromise them.

Okay.

So we don't have a problem to set.

So it's a bit of a difference.

Okay.

Okay.

Silence.

I think in terms of the cross-cutting Operation.

Creativity was mixed, but what I mentioned became so important

that people were not willing to give.

Up.

And the whole, you know, there were no governments for

a long time.

It's good to be to do with learning like they

argue over when the.

When the space of possible economic policies is very large,

then that's the most salient one, because people are less

divided.

As people get more and more information about optimal policies

for them, then that becomes less salient.

The variance is lower.

So the variance in the other dimension.

Greater and the more satiated you.

Know a certain dimension is salient if the variance is

greater.

Yes.

Politically.

Politically.

Polarisation.

Yes.

Yes.

Sorry.

Yes.

Yes.

No.

But silence could mean something for some reason.

Yes.

There are many reasons why conflict becomes strong.

Especially not on the basis of conflict.

Or you could.

You could think that, you know, when inequality becomes very

large, we could have expected that this would be more

salient than other stuff, uh, but somehow.

Finds.

Its manifestation in other dimensions.

And I think that's endogenous somehow the political system.

I don't know.

So silence is also a very big again when we

think seriously about one dimensionality.

Silence is a is a is a big thing that

again, I don't think it's more that or there is

no really good answer.

Feature.

Of why some.

Dimensions are more challenging.

Than others.

So maybe the level of contamination maybe which is related

to the inability to compromise.

Uh.

Surely there is an element of, you know, how much

politicians in the media talk about this?

Fine.

But.

Um.

How often?

Because parties, you know, fight election on the sideline.

They also determine the science of of the damage.

So I think that's a crucial topic also that, you

know, you must do a multi dimensional quality space analysis

if you want to talk about science.

There are a lot of salient topics on which the

polarisation of voters is actually quite small.

Okay.

Thank you.

But it seems like the party's defining the conflict.

There's no proof or evidence that they affect what they're

like.

Right?

Right, right.

I mean, it's hard to prove it, right?

Yeah.

When I said redefining the conflict here, I just meant

that, you know, you're like, think of it as a

conflict between, Are the government and small government plus religion.

That's how you see the conflict in society rather than

original or small government.

It's a small government and big government and civil rights.

So everyone.

You know now.

We use everyone that is being economically on the left

also pro human rights.

It just that's how we think about the conflict in

society.

Everyone is.

You know.

Everyone is a leftist also cares about all this stuff

on the right.

Totally against all this stuff.

And also.

Uh.

And it's not obvious, right?

I mean, if you think about, uh.

Indeed.

Communist societies.

Okay, big government and and a lot of interference in

human rights.

Right.

So if you said you know what?

What makes sense?

Both of them would make sense, right?

If you think about, uh, economic left wing.

You think that people should get the dignity to live

some level of prosperity.

So then you also want to give the dignity of

human rights.

So it could go either way, because again, you know,

think about communist regimes.

They're definitely not libertarian.

Not.

Just central government dictates everything.

Okay.

How many children are you going to have?

What is that?

Anything else?

Yeah.

So this would be related to that title picture, but

is there any work like thinking about these type of

models as political parties, brands and bodies as consumers?

Like.

All brands also have some influence in the type of.

Survivor you as a consumer.

And the products represent different types of ideologies, or.

So.

I think implicitly.

A lot of the people that work on these things

think, okay, parties are like firms offering a platform is

a product.

Uh.

Uh, but.

I don't think that analogy goes beyond much further than

that.

So a little bit like advertisement.

Uh, you could think about the fact that a century

as we spoke last time, campaign contribution allows you to

affect.

So convince uninformed vote.

okay.

So that that is a role of advertising.

Um, but also differences.

Right.

Because consumers I mean, of course we affect one another,

but we are small in the market.

We are also small as voters.

But we are, you know, choosing an outcome that has

externalities on everyone.

So it's, it's, uh, and, and.

And somehow sometimes, you know, parties are using this to

create this conflict thing, right?

I mean, be careful.

The other group of voters, they really all they want

is to destroy you and your way of life.

Um, so part of the.

You know, negative campaigning against the other side.

Is.

Bread and butter of, uh, of political campaigns, whereas in

terms, you know, you can't really show explicit product of

the other of the other.

You show other products generally, but you don't.

So maybe there is something that there.

Um.

So I think the analogy is helpful to think about

this and to see what the labelling is.

And for us also to use tools I o and

stuff to think about.

Yes.

I think like in the beginning we had the assumption

that politicians are like uniformly distributed.

Is that.

Right?

Yeah.

In the first model.

Yeah.

Yeah.

So what?

Um, is that as strong as, like, what happens if

they're not?

Is it reasonable to think that, um.

Yeah.

Like, they would be uniformly distributed?

Uh, or I would say very broadly that distributed like,

for this population, probably nothing.

Yeah, exactly.

Yeah.

And, uh, so not sure what if they do it

in the paper.

So if you think that they're very concentrated in the

middle, then you don't really need the party to reduce

the variance.

Already.

The distribution is quite complicated.

Whereas if it's polarised maybe you need the parties to.

Do.

That.

Uh, for middle of the road conditions, the middle, but

not at the extreme.

Uh, so already you get it from the distribution, right?

If it's very polarised and there are a lot of

conditions on the extreme, if you're in.

A.

You can run independently as an extreme politician with little

variance, right?

Yeah.

Um.

So definitely it's methods.

Yes.

Uh, but I think to a degree, because you think

about politician is represented as someone also is ideology like

candidate and then.

You.

The reasonable assumption is to think about the distribution of

politicians as the same as the distribution of population.

You just say that those who have X could be

active.

Yes.

Yes.

Um, would it make sense to have a circle, or

is there a parallel world where, I mean.

I'm just.

Yeah.

Maybe you're going to I.

Oh, Interrail?

Yes.

About the Salop model, maybe.

And I was wondering what are the implications in terms

of like.

Because maybe then, you know, you don't have a central

you don't have a centre, right?

Maybe if the parties are distributed along the perimeter of

the circle.

I don't know.

I'm just throwing it.

Yeah, yeah.

No, no, it's nice to think about stuff.

So I would think, yeah, we need to sort of

think what?

Uh.

I mean, I can definitely think about the policy space

itself being, you know, not as rigid.

Right.

Because it could be that on some dimensions.

Favourite orientation of buildings.

Yeah.

So, so in the sense that, you know, uh, you

can do the, you can do an in extreme positions

if you don't change anything.

If this dimension is sort of middle of the road,

won't you move to a more extreme stuff?

You.

You cannot implement too much, right?

Okay.

So you move too much to the right.

There is just one policy that you can do.

It's like there is no, no, uh, give and take

on the other dimension.

Right?

And the more you move, you know, to be less

extreme here, you can also implement more policies.

Okay, okay.

So you can you you can think about something like

that.

Um.

The policy space.

Uh.

Now where would art is located?

Yeah, that that is hard for me now to.

But again, you can think about, you know, maybe there

are extremist.

That, you know, This is this is a bit like

I'm very extreme on this dimension, and I'm not willing

to compromise on the other dimension.

Okay.

So this.

I mean, you could.

Yeah.

Also you can think about sort.

Of.

Cost, right?

I mean, the more I spend on.

I can spend on this dimension going in this direction

and this direction.

And the more I spend, I have nothing left to

spend on the other dimension.

Okay.

This here.

All right.

So I'm exhausting.

All all.

Resources.

So the proof of, you know, of this is in

the, you know, are we.

So this is the way to think about, uh, feasible

policy space.

Okay, okay.

It's a nice way to think about the physical space

because we're very dogmatic about square.

Yes.

Okay.

But there may be economic constraints that we didn't really

properties think about.

Think about abstract political.

So the square is definitely like abstract political preferences.

The triangle gives you some economic constraint too much.

This is another form for.

Okay.

I'm happy that everyone asks the question.

Okay, see you next week.

Uh, is it okay next week if we.

Start at 1050?

Yeah.

51.

Yeah.

I'll send you an email.

That's.

Very true.

Maybe it's better now.

Than.

It is.

Sorry.

I didn't see you guys.

Yeah, yeah.

I think.

We're having a civil war.

Yeah.

Thank you.

Yeah.

Let me know how much I agree with this.

No.

Nothing.

Absolutely.

No.

No, no.

It's, uh.

It's a pleasure.

Hey.

Um.

Yeah.

I'm, uh.

Rush.

And I like.

I say I like seats in two minutes.

I don't know how he does that.

I'm eating in the meetings.

We believe that.

No.

Everyone will play a.

Please.

Everyone.

Just eat.

Hi.

Hi.

Did you want to turn in the many questions from

this week to do, to turn in the many questions

from this week, or just have prepared just yesterday.

Not here, is it?

Not this morning.

So that was turned it.

It's good.

Brent.

Yeah.

I was wondering because this was a longer assignment.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah.

No no, no.

I was hoping to do this.

Um, wait a minute.

This is an important debate, actually.

I was going to.

I'm going to put up here.

So if you have an essay, uh, introduction written, would

you be sitting, please sit.

Okay.

These two.

Yeah.

In the front table, please.

Somehow we have more poaching cases this week.

It looks like it.

Isn't that.

Oh, I did ask.

You see the other way around.

Can we have a, you know, the lower tables?

And I said we can't.

Sorry.

We can't change the furniture, but we can.

I'm going to Reno.

Hey, the chairs are very comfortable.

They have a pretty low.

Gary, do you like them?

Of course, of course.

60 minutes.

Oh, that's not right.

I would email them if they say so.

You can't.

You can't change the font.

But clearly they can.

Oh that's a that's a cheeky.

Okay.

All right.

Yeah.

It's.

Always.

Good afternoon.

Yeah.

It's a sitting down today.

So according to the whiteboard.

These.

Lecture 8:

So quiet.

Yeah, I.

Started freaking out at some point.

I've been alone for the past five minutes now.

How are you doing?

It's not my day.

No.

I'm sorry.

That's all I didn't say.

So I arrived at the gym a bit later than

what I wanted.

Which means I kind of, you know, like, delayed everything.

And then, like, as I was leaving the gym.

I realised that I forgot my ID, so I had

to buy back home because, like, today, I keep going

in and out of building so I can not have

my tea.

I had to bike all the way back home to

get my ID and then like Because I was like,

I just can't do with that shit.

I took like an e-bike to come here, which means

that I paid like a £1 surcharge for like six

minutes of biking.

Um.

I think, like, they should make us pay like the

e-bike.

Like, not based on, like, are you taking it £1?

More like you just took it for five minutes, so

don't worry, it's free.

Okay.

How about you?

I think the human virus wants you can get free.

That human forest wants to get free.

Yeah, but I think that you still need to put

some subscription now.

Uh.

You see what I mean?

Maybe, I don't know.

I think, like, you still need to, because I looked

it up, and I think that it's kind of like

you need to pay to unlock it.

And then the ten minutes, the first ten minutes are

free.

So I could do that, but it depends.

I should check it out.

Maybe it's worth it.

This goes like.

This.

Mm.

I don't know.

I think I regret to mention the issue is that

people drive and say dangerous things.

But.

Yeah, you know, sometimes I've seen this morning I was

like, at the crossing between, like, what then becomes Kingsway.

I don't know if it's Kingsway already then, but what

becomes Kingsway and what becomes Oxford Street at some point?

But it's not Oxford Street yet.

I was at discussing and basically like they were still

red for the cyclists, but it was so obvious it

was going to become green in like the next, I

don't know, 15 second, 22nd because the other like the

ones on Oxford Street, they had like the red light.

But you know, because the red, the light had just

turned red, there was still like cars crossing and there

was this bike next to me.

He just decided to go anyway.

Yeah.

And I kept on thinking, like.

And then, you know, like, I was behind him, so

he maybe had like 3 or 4 seconds.

15 minutes.

Sorry.

All right.

They started 15 minutes later.

Oh, fuck.

I forgot about this.

Right.

I was right, I.

Should have posted a message.

I wouldn't have read it anyway.

But anyway, point being that, like.

Um, he had, like, maybe like 4 or 5 seconds,

like early compared to me, but like, his risk of

dying was like much higher than because he started slaloming

between the cars.

Yeah.

And I felt like, was this really worth it?

Like four seconds.

It's never worth it.

Like.

It's like Cosby past you, and then you, like, catch

him up like a minute later, like, was that worth

it?

Like you could have hurt someone.

Like, okay, I also do sometimes stuff that are a

bit like, you know, not great, but I feel like

I never okay, I never do it with respect to

cars.

I do it with respect to pedestrians and I'm super

careful at the same time with pedestrian like I do.

I do not always respect the red light green light,

especially with respect to pedestrians, but when there are cars

just next to me, no, I fucking respect it because

I'm just like too scared of getting hit by a

car.

And uh.

I'm the opposite.

Especially in the UK.

Like car drivers, they're super aggressive.

And this is coming from someone.

This is coming from someone who used to bike in

Milan.

What is this?

No way, no way.

I don't believe that.

It's definitely not more aggressive than Paris.

France is so aggressive.

No.

No, but the thing is, like in the UK, it's

a bit like, okay, if it's your turn to cross,

you know, if you had one of the zebras with

the lights, there will definitely stop and think that in

France doesn't really happen.

You see what I mean?

But in the UK though if you're crossing outside of

the zebra, they will run over you like it's insane.

Well, you know, in France it's a bit like they

will stop anyway.

Like maybe it's going to take them a while to

stop, but they will stop anyway.

Like if you cross outside the zebra, you don't feel

like they actually want to hit you.

Well, in London I feel like sometimes they want to

punish me for eating.

Up, you know?

Yeah.

Oh.

Oh.

Yeah.

The, um.

It can be very dangerous.

Especially this time, I guess.

I see it's a good thing that he told me

he's going to stop.

I think that's good.

Let's keep you alive.

As he starts making coffee.

On Monday.

It's going to be a month.

Wow.

That's great.

They gave me all of the cigarettes.

And then I hid it.

HID them.

Buried them in the garden.

I'm just scared that when he's over and I'm in

the bathroom, he's going to start looking for them.

You see what I mean?

Yeah.

Oh.

That's funny.

Yeah.

I have no motivation to do today.

At all.

At all?

At all.

Today is just my lectures and the last day.

Same for me.

Except then at the end, I have to teach.

Oh, yeah.

That's Saturday.

That's a really long day.

Yeah.

What's that?

As you're still working?

Earnest.

It works every other day.

No, it's not a matter of where you or whatever.

I tried to use it.

Like, even when it's not working, you know, like, I

just, like, push.

And I'm like, yeah.

Let's see my slide for today's class.

Circle.

And that's Michael gloves.

I don't know how you do it.

It's impossible not to like us.

So it's really it's really paint was installed, but it

was because when it stops, maybe.

When one.

When it stops being painful.

It's like I really struggled to heat up my apartment.

Eddie.

It's, uh.

I guess it's an old apartment.

Yeah, but.

Okay.

I went to Dmitri's place the other day because he

forgot his tablet.

He was very warm in his apartment.

I don't get it.

I don't get how they're able to have, like, such

a warm apartment, and I don't.

Maybe they leave the heater on with their way.

I don't know what it's about.

Surely.

Um.

Anyway, point being there, like, I think it's like, maybe

because, like, the tap in the bathroom is like, the

furthest away from the heating thing.

I don't know, it's like by the time I'm done

washing my hands, the water is not hot yet.

You see what I mean?

And so, like, I don't know what I'm supposed.

I don't know if I'm supposed to wait for the

water to get warm before I wash my hand, but

then I feel like I'm wasting water.

I can do it with the shower, because obviously I'm

not going to get a fucking full shower from my

hands.

It's just the hands.

No.

I think that you should.

Yeah, I feel bad doing that.

Or you can just.

You can just man up.

That's what I.

Wish.

I wanted to take Johnny out this weekend for his

birthday and then, like, he's sick now and I don't

know if he'll be able to get sick.

I'm really annoyed because I was really hyped to go

out myself.

Maybe I should just go out today and be like,

yeah, I went out for your birthday.

You just like you missed it.

I'm.

Like.

Well, thanks.

Yeah.

Are you finding it hard to get onto edge room

at the moment?

Would you say that.

Huh.

Pedro?

Yeah, the Wi-Fi network.

Well, I can't get on to it.

Yeah, it seems so.

It's not connected.

I don't know.

It shouldn't be that hard.

A huge Wi-Fi network.

Just kidding.

It's obviously quite difficult.

Thank you.

Okay.

Okay.

I guess it also happens sometimes.

Like it's disconnected my laptop, and then it takes all

the time.

Yeah.

Right.

I wish it was better.

I don't know if my hands would be moving.

Sorry.

Just communicating with your stomach.

Yeah, I'm trying my best.

See.

This is what happens all the time.

Do you know what I do when I have time

for breakfast?

I grab a half of cashews.

Oh, you can't do that.

Oh my God.

I say the main source of my calories.

I know, why are you like this as well?

So I'll leave it on.

Oh, no.

Are you there?

Yeah.

Oh, God.

That sucks.

Well, it doesn't have.

Such a complete.

Nuts, Notice my banana.

And lots of.

My.

Banana down there.

I mean, you know, you eat the stuff to find

out.

Okay, this.

Is where it is.

Yes.

Oh.

Okay.

So okay.

We're a smaller group so we can.

If we start.

Yeah.

Yes.

Um, do we know roughly what the coursework is going

to be similar.

So as last year, what are you going to do

for half term is to write your variable.

Uh, we will publish 2 or 3 papers one week

after the course.

And formally you will have three weeks to do it.

Um, will be some guidance.

That means it's really a way for you to learn

how to do this type of stuff, how to do

it, and to really delve into it very, very deeply.

So.

Okay.

Sorry.

Okay.

So I want to think today.

So we thought about how institutions aggregate preferences.

And typically we think about you know individuals.

So maybe preferences is composed of some or least revealed

preferences in the political system.

Maybe they're composed of some innate preferences.

And information because we are not always sure.

So maybe there is some direction or what people call

maybe ideology and and there may be also information that

would somehow manage to change my preferred action on my

preferred action in different situations.

Uh, especially in the face of uncertainty.

And that has been one of the reasons why we

think about.

Delegation.

Okay.

So if if we think about spanning again, I try

to spend institutions in one way of creating sort of

bigger and bigger coalitions.

Okay.

When we were thinking about parties and maybe government coalitions.

So another way to think about sort of to have

some metric of political institutions to think about.

Is to think about, uh, a trade off of.

Let me just.

Let me just present it so we can think about,

uh, elections or let me actually think about referendum.

Okay.

What do we have in a referendum?

We have a decision that is taken by the whole

polity, okay?

And everyone is equal in terms of, you know, one

person, one vote.

And then we.

Will move towards, you know, the other, the other end

in which in the elections we choose.

A representative.

Okay.

Really what the representative is doing is taking many decisions

on our behalf.

Of course we choose, you know, the way we choose

more than one representative Congress, people, Parliament, Parliament and so

on.

But at the extreme, we choose head of state.

Okay.

That takes many decisions on our behalf.

Of course, the other there is another extreme dimension which

someone becomes our representative without us choosing them.

So you can think about autocracy.

Okay.

Um.

I think maybe autocracy is a form of.

You know, full delegation.

Okay, you think about this.

We don't have to go all the way.

Okay.

So what?

What are the trade offs involved here?

Um, one reason for delegation is that we think that

it's actually hard to aggregate information because information is costly.

You need people to somehow work and acquire this information

so it's better to choose a representative.

That's great.

The problem is that a representative will never fully represent

our interests.

So the word representative is, you know, obviously.

So some sort of an oxymoron because referendum would be

more representative of our preference or information.

Okay.

So there is some trade off between you know, we

think that there is some trade off between how good

the decision will be, okay, because a representative may have

more interest in collecting information about what decisions should.

Uh, what should be the decision?

Uh, because we're probably not influencing a lot of the

outcomes when we are in our friend.

Okay.

So there is a trade off between this.

The quality of the decision and how representative is.

Of course, another issue here is when another issue here

is that which I'm not going to discuss today.

This issue of accountability.

When you have a representative.

Okay.

When you have a representative, it's clear who's responsible for

the decision.

And if it's not good, you can potentially change this

person.

When you have a referendum.

It's a it's very hard to blame, you know, particular

individuals and to pay for someone decision okay.

So.

So the key reason for delegation in most organisations is

that you give sort of the incentives for people to,

to reach the correct decision.

Okay.

So we are in the background assuming that there is

some correct and some wrong decision, and to achieve the

correct decision we need information.

Okay, so the idea here is that somehow information is

spread.

Either among the citizenry that would vote in a referendum

and maybe such sort of elections don't aggregate information properly,

or maybe some experts have more or less information, media

have incentive to collect information and so on.

Uh, and it would be best sort of like the

thought behind it that it would be best to.

Okay.

So I'm first going to look at.

Random or selection.

I'm going to look at this as a mechanism to

aggregate information and to see whether information is aggregated properly

and what direction.

And then I'm going to look at okay.

If we if we delegate, how is the process of

information acquisition or information.

Uh.

Information transmission.

Does it does it work really well.

Okay.

Now if you think so, let's just, you know, open

a fresh page and think about elections more generally.

If we want this to aggregate information or even aggregate

preferences.

We need people to vote.

Okay.

Stay at home or just ten people show up.

Obviously, we're not aggregating anything.

Okay.

Um, and that's a big question that, that.

That for economists is very hard to explain why people

vote.

Okay.

Because in general, we think that whatever you do is

some sort of instrumental.

Okay.

And in large elections, people have no effect.

No single person is going to be pivotal.

Uh, so it's not clear to, you know, why would

people vote?

Okay.

If we think about the simple example, let's say that

there are two groups in the population group A and

group B, and they have different preferences resulting from night

preferences or information.

It doesn't matter.

Um.

If you know, if everyone votes.

Let's say that Group B has the majority, so group

B wins.

Okay.

So then the people from Group A would have been

better off at least weakly.

Just not going to vote.

There's no point in going to vote.

If we know that Group B is okay.

But it cannot be that no one from Group A

vote and everyone from would be votes because again, it's

not efficient.

We just need enough.

It's enough that one person goes to vote on behalf

of B.

Okay.

Uh, but if only one person goes to vote and

we have group B, then B, then a person from

A should go and vote, then, you know, probably have

some tiebreaking rule that gives a little bit of a

chance and so on.

This essentially says that it's there is no pure strategy

equilibrium okay, in which people either vote or don't vote.

Okay.

So that means we are probably going to find a

mixed strategy equilibrium in which, uh.

You know, maybe maybe Group B people are going to

mix between voting and not voting okay.

But.

It's not something that, you know, we're thinking about as

trying to explain properly voting.

So then people thought about just cost of voting.

I just alluded to it weakly, of course.

So then you can think about a model in which

people, uh, draw some costs.

And if the costs are low enough, they go to

vote.

At the end of the day, all these models predict

a much, much, uh, lower turnout that we actually see.

Okay.

It's really hard to explain with a pure instrumental reason

to vote to affect the outcome, why so many people

go to.

Which makes sense, because we I think we understand intuitively

that people don't go to vote because only they think

they're going to affect the outcomes somehow.

We are brought up in a democracy thinking that it's

a civic duty, public duty, and there is an element

of public good in voting because, again, if nobody goes

to vote, it's important for some people.

Good.

Um.

Yes.

There's an answer about sharing information about your preferences anyway

because you're still counted.

So like the turnout is still counted.

So informs the ruling party more about what the preferences

are of the electorate so that in the next election,

they know that they'll be punished if they deviate too

much from their science.

Right.

So this is not only about the basic winner, okay,

but also about signalling my preferences.

So the you can think that the that the margin

of votes is going to affect is going to affect

the let's say B is winning is going to affect

how much we can push it and implement the policies

that they like.

Okay.

So if you're choosing representatives so this is for we're

not just choosing a referendum.

We're choosing a representative and the be representative.

You know if they win with a small margin, if

they can interpret it as indeed preferences and not just

an outcome of coming from coast or something like this,

which is also fake.

But whatever they interpret from the margin of winning, you

know, should inform them some way about, you know, how

much they can push it and push policies in their

in their direction and potentially they will be punished in

the next election.

Uh, if they do that, which is strictly because if

I don't like the person, in any case, I would

not have voted.

I will not vote for them.

Okay.

But yeah.

But actually if we interpret it so so Romney his

job market paper, I don't remember which year it was

published.

In 2005 or 6 in econometric.

Uh, takes the environment that we're going to study today

and extend it to this idea that in.

So.

So what you're sending is a signal here by voting

for one side of the or the other is information.

Information about.

So essentially you're telling them what information you have okay.

So if information you're choosing a representative but the representative

wants to change the policy with respect to your information.

So when you're voting, you're not just trying to make

someone win, but also to affect their policy.

So you're trying to do two things with one vote,

which is a bit tricky.

It might be inefficient, right?

Because you're trying both to select the person that on

average you like better, but to also tell them, actually,

I want you to move more to the right or

more to the left.

Okay.

When you have more than one vote particular, you're voting

for both President and Congress.

Okay.

That's a sort of a better way to do it,

because you're saying, okay, I'm voting for an extreme president

and a Republican president and a Democratic Congress so that

they can somehow mitigate one.

Okay.

Okay.

It would be easier to talk about this one.

Um.

I mean, if you think about how people in other

disciplines, in social sciences think about emotions, they would think

about this idea of civic duty.

They would think about maybe I need to, you know,

civic duty that in a way that, you know, people

ask me, would you vote?

And if I say no, sort of they will.

Then There is a nice paper by, uh, Featherstone and

some drawing.

Looking at, uh, sort of the ethical voter.

Uh.

Modelling this idea that.

That, uh, when I decide whether to vote or not,

I'm thinking, okay, imagine that other people would also adopt

this strategy.

What should be the strategy that all of us are

going.

Into something that, you know, we always resisted in game

theory because of course.

Right.

I mean, prisoner's dilemma coordination game, we could have solved

all of this stuff by saying, ah, if we somehow

think that everyone else should follow these strategies, of course

we would have cooperate.

So we resisted this idea, uh, in game theory.

But there may be some environments in which this is

most.

People just have a preference to learn.

And that's really you can explain everything by having access

to both.

I you know, I definitely I, you know, I wanted

to become a citizen because I wanted to both, uh,

do you regret it?

Feel.

To feel, uh, you know, to I think there is

some illusion of influence.

I think there's something.

There's something.

Yeah.

Okay.

So.

so.

You know why?

Why are we voting?

So the question of turnout is hard for us to

explain.

Why are we voting?

And which might be okay, because there are a lot

of things that we don't explain, right?

We play an ultimatum game.

We give our prediction for an equilibrium.

People don't play this particular equilibrium.

They have other motives, motives in mind.

So we could, um, you know, I think I can

live with the fact that game theory gives some predictions

that you would be getting around it because we identify

what the ultimate rational person will do.

Okay.

And then we see deviations from this.

And then we can find, try to find explanations of,

you know, why do we see this differently.

So so it is important to, you know, the stand

the very basic predictions of the ultra ultra rational.

Okay, so this thing that I described in the beginning

was called the voting paradox.

I mean, again, it's not really.

It's a paradox in the sense that we don't have

a pure strategy equilibrium.

Uh.

So we do see people, of course, that are abstaining.

So we also want to explain that again, you can

always explain it with high cost of voting or that

I don't have the preference to vote.

And.

Okay.

Another issue.

So so so why vote or why abstain.

That's one question.

And then another question is.

Uh.

How to vote.

So who to vote for or which policy to vote

for of course.

But also sincere versus strategic voting.

I sort of touched upon it in the first lecture

when we looked at the sort of I mentioned the

citizen candidate model, some sort of voting sample.

And that's also a question which affects the question of

why to vote.

Uh, you would think that if people really just have

a preference to vote, they probably don't want it.

So let me I want to show my preferences.

If you think about your motivation, you know, it's already

a strategic motivation because you have to think strategically of

how each marginal to effect what's going to happen later

on.

And, uh, so you're thinking about how you vote is

there is a signal about your preferences.

Voting system and an optimal voting system.

In an audit.

Of course, there is the whole issue of how different

voting rules are going to affect all of this.

Okay, but I'm just going to stick to simple majority

today.

So on this.

On this, if I take you back to again the

first lecture that I mentioned, Kunduz is the Kunduz a

winner?

Right.

We had the same bicycle.

Paradox cycle.

Yeah.

Okay.

So Kunduz was, as I said, it was.

And it was looking at at voting rules as a

way to aggregate information.

And it is key result was to say, you know,

so it was as I said, it was one of

the pillars of the French Revolution.

And he said, okay, we need majority rule.

Why?

Because majority rule is a good institutional organisation to aggregate

information.

Yes.

When people get information about what is the correct thing

to do just by the law of large numbers.

Right.

So the idea.

But.

But I would say quite revolutionary at this point.

If you think about this issue, when people get information

they would in the election, they would vote according to

the information.

So the idea is that they vote sincerely.

Okay.

And then we get information that is aggregated, right?

So if each of us gets a piece of ID

signal, okay, or there is enough ID content in the

information that we have, we have a large quality information

will be okay.

So this is just the law of large numbers.

Okay, so the paper that I'm, I will talk about

in the first, uh, part of the of today is

a paper that looks at the idea of Condorcet, but

trying to think about strategic focus.

Okay.

And what we're going to do is we're going to

explain sort of, uh, who to vote for.

And why to vote versus abstaining.

Okay.

So after this introduction, what we're going to do is

to say, okay, we're looking at the election, basically elections

majority rule.

They're going to be two options.

People will get information about whether A or B is

better.

Okay.

Zero one.

Okay.

It's better.

We are going to assume that people can potentially think

strategically.

What do we mean by that?

When you just have two options of course in general

you would want to vote in theory, right.

Because if you're pivotal you would rather vote for the

option.

Like most.

Okay.

So this is a very basic idea when we just

think about aggregating preferences.

But the next step is to think actually what we

are doing is aggregating information.

So when I vote, I need to think about actually

what other people vote means in terms of the information.

So that's going to be the the key idea that

would lead to us to explain sometimes why we have

abstention and to whom we are going to.

Keep going again is some sort of a welfare analysis

understanding.

So the two, you know, two reasons to do it.

One is to understand sort of positive properties, to see

who's voting and why.

And the second is to understand whether information is adequate.

We want to know whether elections are a good mechanism.

As I said, I'm focusing on a particular voting goal.

We can look at other voting.

Okay.

So let me give you a very simple example of

the of the key intuition that we're looking at.

So the state could be the zero one.

So there is some uncertainty about what is the right

thing to do.

So the stat could be the zero one, and the

two options that we voted on is either zero one.

Okay.

So that's the set of actions that the political movement,

this is the referendum okay.

So we think that the action zero is good at

state here in action.

One is good in state one.

And let's say that there is a prior.

So the prior that the state is one is, I

don't know, larger than half.

So it's more likely that the state is one.

Okay.

So now I need to assume what people in this

society know.

So let's say that there is some share of people.

Think about you know, the key issue is the paradox

of voting is that actually we know exactly how many

people are in each group We're not sure about how

many people are in each group.

Okay.

I don't know if people are actually going to vote

for me or not.

I should probably go and vote.

Okay, so let's introduce some uncertainty.

I'm not sure how many people are in this column.

Okay, so I don't know how many people will come

to vote.

So there is always a chance for me to be

pivot.

Okay.

So just keep that in mind.

But what I know in terms of information is that

there are some people that are informed and some people

that are unclear.

So the people that are informed receive a signal about

the state.

And let's say that the signal is fully informative.

Okay.

So there are some people that, you know, experts, scientists,

journalists or whatever, they know what is said.

And there are some people that don't get any information

in addition to them.

So there are two different.

Okay.

Okay.

Now let's follow those and think okay.

You know, people are going to vote sincerely.

What does it mean?

Clearly they're going to vote to what they think is

the right one.

Let's look at the symmetric.

So we don't even need to look at symmetric.

Centrally tells us what's going to happen.

So what does it mean.

It's very simple.

All the informed voters are going to vote according to

their information.

Right.

So either 0 or 1 depending on what is the

state.

And all the uninformed people are going to vote for

state.

Okay.

Good.

So is information aggregated in this in this election?

If the informed are more than a majority, then yes.

So if they have a majority in the coalition then

yes, because then it's not going to matter.

So if, for example, the state is one, everyone was

followed.

If the state is zero, majority vote to zero.

But in the case in which the uninformed is not

a majority.

Okay.

As I said, there is some randomness.

Some random number of people in the economy in number

may be random number in any form.

Uh.

Okay.

If the uninformed are the majority going to be the

majority, then and the state is zero, then information is

not aggregated properly.

Very good.

State zero.

There are some people that have known it.

They should have been somehow decisive in this election.

Okay, so now if I think about voters thinking strategically

and it's.

The informed voters, it's obvious that they still need to

vote for according to the information.

Okay.

So there's even one post about the uninformed, right?

The uninformed need to think, wait.

My vote.

My own personal vote.

So.

Let's look at this equilibrium and ask, is this still

in equilibrium when we think strategically.

Okay.

So for the informed people these are the strategies.

So now I take as given the strategies of other

people for the informed people.

Uh, given these strategies, as I said, you have to

vote with your information for the uninformed, given the strategy,

let's say I'm uninformed.

I know that these are the strategies that people are

using.

Then I'm thinking, actually, I'm only going to affect the

election when I'm pivotal in the state in which I'm

pivotal.

There is sort of 5050 among those that voted.

I don't know how many people are out there.

Okay.

5050.

So half vote for one, half vote for zero.

It has to be that this state is here.

Right?

The only way for me to get to for me

to be pivotal, given that I know how all the

uninformed voting.

The only way for me to do that is that

the inform the vote.

So actually, I learn that if I affect the election,

the state is you.

Okay.

So that means that they should not vote for one

man actually should vote for them.

This is not to say.

This is not to say that that this is an

equilibrium.

Right?

Exactly.

For the same reason.

Right.

All we found out or everything.

The only thing that we found out.

Okay.

The only thing that we found out that it's not

possible the that all the uninformed.

So it's not possible to have the sincere equilibrium.

It's not possible in the same way, to have that

all the uninformed vote in the same way.

Okay.

Because then they want to switch to the other.

It is definitely an equilibrium in which all the uninformed

are just saying it.

Okay, so if you abstaining, here is a good possibility.

Okay.

We have fully common preferences here, right?

Fully common preferences here.

There are people that know what to do.

I don't know what to do as a group.

If we all vote in the same way, we're just

hurting the result.

We should just state.

Okay.

The result affect the uninformed.

Do they have a preference over 0 or 1?

So as I said it's truly common preference.

But in state one we want action one and instead

zero We want action zero, so it's fully common value.

Okay.

So it's a very extreme case.

Okay.

Okay.

So in this extreme case of a common fully common

value, what we find is that and of course I've

been extreme here in the information structure.

Okay fine.

But first of all we found a very clear reason

for why some people should abstain.

Okay.

And in fact, you see this.

There are an election in the US.

For example, when you go to vote, you vote on

a lot of stuff.

Okay.

So from the president to Congress, to the district attorney,

to your governor.

And then there are some referenda on the ballot.

Legalise cannabis or not at the time.

So so there is lots of stuff.

Okay.

There is some stuff because there is so much.

Surely there is some stuff that you would probably you

would not be sure about, you know, local sheriff this

or that.

We're not sure about what or how to how to

vote on that.

Uh, and you see people, you know, they actually turn

out they are the, the they vote for some stuff,

but a lot of other stuff is, takes place empty.

Right.

So that may potentially, uh, explain this.

Okay.

So what I'm going to do is I'm going to

look at the just make this analysis a bit more

precise in a model in which people don't have fully

common values.

There is a common value element, but they also have

private values.

Uh.

And so what would be interesting to look at again

is the behaviour of people.

So there will be people that are going to be

uninformed on the problem okay.

So we're going to look at the behaviour of these

people.

And then we are going to check whether information is

aggregated or not okay.

In this simple economy that we looked at, if all

the uninformed informed that there is information.

Okay, but it is a very different equilibrium to what,

uh, to what they say had in mind when you

talked about information aggregation coming from sensing, coming from sensing.

Okay.

So this is a paper by fellows on the percent

off from.

Ah they have.

So let me introduce the preferences and then I'll tell

you about another paper of this.

So there are two state zero and one.

And state zero is less likely.

The probability of state zero is alpha.

The two candidates which essentially represent two policies zero and

one.

And there's three types of agents.

So now introducing the private values zero agent likes zero

no matter what Okay.

One agent like Swann.

No matter what, an independent agent is the same as

before.

They want zero in state, zero and one in state

one.

Okay, so we've included private values in sort of maybe

in a bit of an extreme way.

So there is no people in the middle that, you

know, like maybe zero in state, zero more than they

like one in state one or that if there is

a mistake, one in state zero, maybe they like it

less than zero in state one.

Okay.

So they have another paper in econometrics in which they

look at the continuum of preferences like this.

So the results are essentially the same.

Uh, so it's it's really enough to look at.

Okay.

This these people zero and one, we call them partisan,

right.

They, they want zero no matter what.

That's a way to think about partisans that, uh, they're

less responsive to information, and they're not going to change

their mind.

Okay.

The next assumption is the assumption on the uncertainty of

how many people are going to vote, which I alluded

to before, because we need some uncertainty to know that

there will always be a probability that I'm pivotal.

Okay.

So that means this assumption says nature.

Select an agent to vote with probability one minus BFE.

Okay.

So only with some probability you are chosen to be

a vote.

Otherwise, you know for sure.

Given that I've chosen you to be a voter, these

are the types.

So pi is the share of independent P0, the share

of partisans P1, the share of uh partisans for one

and partisans for zero.

The independent agents are going to be, as I described

before with probability Q, you're going to be fully informed

with probability one minus q.

You're going to be, uh, uninformed.

Okay.

Okay.

So it's a more involved model than what we had

before.

Okay.

Do they know what they're trying to or not?

Do they know what.

Whether they.

Yeah.

Yeah yeah yeah.

They know whether they.

Yes.

Okay.

So.

So our life is simple in the following sense.

The partisans, we know how they're going to vote.

They inform people again for sure.

With majority rule you're going to vote for your information.

Okay.

There's no cost of voting to a degree.

Cost of.

Yeah, there is a cost if you vote in the

wrong way.

Right.

So we are only interested in the uninformed and what

they're going to.

That's our only strategic consideration.

Half of the half of solving is to is to.

Is.

Is the notation not to to.

Okay.

Let me show you.

So what you need to do as the uninformed really

is to choose whether to abstain, to vote for zero,

or to vote for one.

A lot of models don't take abstaining seriously, but abstaining

is, is is an important is an important option.

Um, formally let's think about the mixed strategy.

So given your type.

So if we know that you are uninformed okay.

Given your type then tau s is the probability.

So Tao is zero.

Is the probability of voting zero times one, is the

probability of voting one, and the remaining probability is to

abstain.

Okay.

So finally we're going to think about the mixed strategy.

But we can actually interpret it as the share of

types that will vote for zero.

Among the uninformed, the shelf types that we vote for

and the share of types between say.

Okay.

And we're looking at the symmetric Nash equilibrium.

What do we mean by that.

All the uninformed.

So if we think about the mixed reality or the

unfold we have in the same way we could interpret

it as an asymmetric problem, assigning some people to vote

in zero assignment and some dupes.

Okay.

So this is what I meant in terms of notation,

that there are going to be two pieces of 2

or 3 pieces of notation.

Okay.

Let's say I pick a random voter and I'm asking

myself, what's the probability that this voter.

Instead said vote for x.

So sigma z x.

Given a particular strategy for the uninformed people in the

population.

Okay.

So for example uh sigma zero one, given tau, the

probability that you vote uh in state zero, this is

the state and this is the election.

Okay.

So what's this probability?

There is the probability that you are a voter plus

the share of the zero or the share of the

one.

Partisans.

Right.

So it's one minus p five times p one over

one minus p five.

So this is you know right.

So with.

Probability p one you vote for one no matter what

is the.

State right.

Then with probability p five times one minus q.

Sorry pi times one minus q.

You're uninformed and you vote for one with this probability

right?

So these two elements do not depend on the state,

right?

I don't know the state of the parties and votes

for one, no matter what.

Okay.

So this is zero sigma 01Y, the independent, the partisan

people that like zero don't vote for one.

And the informed people don't vote for one.

Okay.

So then sigma one one.

Is the same.

Right.

So to vote for one.

First of all I have these people.

They vote for one in case.

Plus the informed people which is P I keep okay.

So this is the probability that the random voter that

I pick votes for one in state one.

Okay.

So now given tau okay, I can actually compute okay.

What's the probability of a tie for example.

And uh.

State one.

Okay.

What's the probability of a tau in state one.

There could be many environments of, of uh, of um

okay.

So let's do this.

I, we need to sum up.

Okay, I will need to sum up over different possibilities

for ties.

Right?

Okay.

Maybe it's just one people voting for zero and one

people voting for one, maybe two.

Two.

Okay, up all the way to add over two.

Okay.

So let's find the M.

Let's choose the many possibilities to choose and people.

Of.

N over two.

And then what do I want for a tie?

The random vote that I think we'll vote.

So this is a tie in state one.

It's good.

Tie state one okay.

So there is a random voter that voted for one

in state one.

And I have m emojis and people like this.

So that's the probability that when people voted one, then

I have the probability that in state one people voted

for zero.

Not one of the ones I have written there, but

as you can see, it is similarly derived.

Right?

Okay.

And then there is the probability that in state one

a person is abstain.

Okay.

How do people abstain.

It's only this one is abstaining.

Is PI1 minus q so zero.

So okay.

It's actually the same in state one.

And they do.

All right.

Because uh.

Partisan abstain and informed.

Members.

Only Donald Trump said that.

Yes.

N minus two n okay.

Yes.

We have all the all the people in the economy.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay, so the probability that a random voter is abstaining.

Yes.

I mean, it doesn't depend on the state.

It also includes the potential that you're not a voter.

Okay.

So this is a tie in state one.

Now when do I influence the vote.

So I need to think I need to think about,

uh, I'm an uninformed voter.

I need to think about whether I want to go

and vote.

And if I go and vote, if I want to

vote one or I'm going to want to vote zero,

I can influence the vote.

And, uh, for example, if I'm debating myself whether to,

uh, stay at home or vote for zero, when am

I going to influence the election?

It's going to influence the election in the following cases.

If zero is behind one vote, okay, then when I

go to vote, I create a tie.

And then if, uh, or if there is a tie,

okay.

Then when I go and vote for zero, then I

break the tie and zero is elected.

Okay.

So you know, this is the probability of a tie

in state one.

You can also compute the probability that zero is behind

one vote in state one.

So there would be just, you know, uh, minus one

here and plus one here and the same when I

think about voting for one or voting for one versus

voting for zero, you can compute all these elements.

Let us, for simplicity, just focus on the probability of

a time and ignore, you know, the other.

So I can compute the probability of at time state

one I can compute the probability of at time state

zero, which will be very similar.

So here I will have sigma zero zero to.

And here I have sigma zero one.

But the rest is the same.

So the probability of not voting standing is going to

be the same in both.

It will be this but it will be the same.

Expression.

Here is what I described before.

Do I want to vote for 1 or 2?

Abstain?

So I just think ex-ante there is some probability that

the state is one which is one minus alpha.

If in this case, if there is a tie or

in state one, or if one is behind one vote,

then I'm benefiting.

And if the state is zero, then I'm losing.

So I have a minus sign.

Okay.

So in the event of these ties, roughly ties or

one behind, then the number two sink in state zero.

And in the event in which the state is won

in this particular event, that's the probability okay.

Okay.

The first result says.

If I'm totally indifferent between 1 and 0, I should

state.

There's some missing things in the proof here, so I'll.

I'll skip that.

Let's go to the next results.

That is more.

Okay.

This lemma is really the heart of this.

Okay.

Um, imagine that we look at the sequence of equilibria

when the number of voters becomes large and okay.

So now we are looking at these two sigma zero

one sigma one okay.

This is a wrong vote.

Okay?

This is a wrong vote.

Imagine that Sigma one zero along this equilibrium when we

take into infinity.

Sigma one zero is greater than sigma zero.

And it always remains greater.

And it's bounded away.

Okay.

The different interpretation of this is a random voter is

more likely to be to have the wrong vote in

state one, rather than in state you.

Okay.

Random voter is more likely to have the wrong vote

in state one rather than in states.

Okay, now remember as an uninformed vote voter.

Essentially, to decide what to vote for.

Okay, I'm looking at the pivotal event.

So let's say just ties two ties okay.

And essentially I'm trying to learn which ties more likely

is the time state one more likely or in the

tying state zero.

That means that term being pivotal.

Right?

From being pivotal and learning, what is the state?

Okay.

Now if.

Sigma zero one.

Uh.

Written Sigma one.

Yes P.

That's right.

All of them.

This is Sigma one one.

Sigma 10P0 plus.

One.

Okay.

Okay.

So, uh.

Sigma one.

Sigma zero zero is sigma one zero plus p and

Q.

Okay.

And similarly sigma one one is sigma zero one Plus

Pete.

Okay.

Okay.

So now I'm comparing these ratios.

What's the likelihood of a tie in state one compared

to state zero.

Okay.

So these are going to be the same right.

I'm going to have these two multiplications here and here.

Okay.

So really the important element is to compare this and

this right.

They will both be multiplied.

If it is true that the wrong vote is more

likely to take one then say State zero then.

Okay.

Then essentially with a large enough population okay.

This is going to go to infinity, okay.

It's going to be infinitely more likely that a wrong

vote, so infinitely more likely that a tie is in

state one.

So I'm really learning from being defaulted.

I the same that we had before in the super

simple example.

Okay, so even though we created all this structure.

And.

The proofs are more involved.

Okay.

The idea is that I get a very when the

population becomes large, I get a very clear knowledge of

what is this thing?

Okay.

Think about this intuitively.

A tie is really a mistake, okay?

A tie should not happen when there is some information

in the economy.

The uninformed voters vote without information.

Okay.

Partisans are always fixed.

Right.

So all these other people vote, disregarding information.

But there is a group in the population that votes

with information.

Okay.

So to get the wrong tie is really a wrong

outcome.

Okay.

In some sense, to get to get a tie to

match the rise from a bias, okay.

Against the information to get the tie more likely in

state one compared to zero means that that you know,

this this this is what is creating this.

The fact that it's more likely that it's you know,

that's why that this is the ingenuity of just thinking

about one rotor in Toronto, right?

Presenting this is behaviour in the population.

Okay.

If each voter is more likely to be wrong in

that one than zero, we are much more likely to

generate.

How can it be otherwise?

We have this speed.

That's the that's the intuition.

Okay.

So that means okay.

So here is the result.

It's more likely to have a wrong vote in state

X.

So what you should do is an independent as an

independent uninformed is vote for X okay.

So it's better to vote for X.

The next action is abstain.

And the worst thing is to vote for okay.

So the data from here, in case you know it's

best to vote for one rather than abstain rather than

hopeful.

Okay.

So this is just a lemma.

It doesn't tell us what the equilibrium is, but it

tells us that, you know, if we are in an

environment in which that tie really tells us what is

the state, okay, that's how we should be voting for

zero would be the worse off for sure.

We know it's not.

So I really like the fact, you know, the fact

that actually You know, just knowing how to write the

expressions makes it really easy to see again the intuition

from.

Okay.

And here is the result.

So the first so all the results okay.

Let's take it slowly.

The first result says if the number the share of

the uninformed independent is less than let's say the partisan

for zero are more numerous than the partisans for one.

Okay.

So there is a partisan bias towards zero okay.

So the.

Proposition takes the result that we, you know, analysed before

and put it into actual, you.

Know, I believe.

It.

If the shaft position is smaller.

Not enough to overcome the partisan bias in the population.

The best thing that the independent can do is vote

for one.

They're trying to make up for this bias.

Okay, so there is a role for us as uninformed.

Okay.

So just staying at home is not good enough.

Let us try.

What we're trying to do is to let the informed

decide.

Right.

That's what we're trying to do here.

So but we are trying to correct for the bias

by, by voting for one, okay.

Because we know there's going to be some randomness.

You know, that that's that's the right thing to do.

Okay.

Because obviously the wrong vote in this case is not

going to be for state zero rather than okay.

Because all these parties.

Okay.

What if it's the opposite.

So there is more than enough for us to correct

this bias, to correct the partisan bias.

Then think of it as a share of us is

going to correct this bias.

Okay, of course we do it through mix strategy, but

never mind in a symmetric equilibrium.

A share of us is going to correct this bias.

And the rest what are they going to do to

abstain.

Right.

This is the best way to make the make the

informed people.

Decide okay.

So we're implementing it in a symmetric to make strategy

equilibrium.

So we're going to mix between voting for one and

the mixture probability.

You can see you know you can see that it's

exactly the one that would create.

So that you know we fix the bias.

Okay.

And the key result is that after all this we

resurrect the result that information is aggregated in the economy.

Okay.

For any epsilon, there exist a high enough n such

that the probability that the election fully aggregates information and

is the number of people is greater than one minus

epsilon.

Okay.

What do we mean by fully aggregating information.

In this case actually the you know, the the preferences

and information is fully served.

Okay.

One way to think about this is imagine an outside

external person will get all the information in this economy,

what they will choose for the people.

Okay.

That is also what is chosen.

So if somehow there was a central authority looking at

all the information.

There are some trivial cases.

So if the partisans for zero are a majority in

the population, they would win in any case.

But that is what the central planner would also choose.

Okay.

So for the case in which, you know, no group

is a majority, no partisan group is a majority, then

we will decide accordingly.

Okay.

Of course we need large enough for this because we

are thinking about these shares of the population.

So the law of large numbers works.

And think about these shares and the noise coming from

the mixtures actually, you know, not becoming noisy anymore, but

the shares of the people, it's as if we can

call the coordinate the shows of the people to, to

actually create this.

Okay.

So.

So then the intuition here is, uh, very similar to

the reason that we have options when we think about

the winners cars.

Okay.

Auctions with common values.

Right.

Everyone will need to decide whether to how much to

be there for oil drilling.

Each of the firms gets a signal about how this

whether this oilfield is is beneficial or not.

Okay.

If we would be the value if I win, I

know that everyone's value is lower than mine.

So they received lower signal than mine.

So when willing, I'm actually not excited.

As excited as I should be of bidding my value,

because actually I should shed my value.

Given that you know the common value I'm learning from

winning when I beat my value, that actually I should

have been lower.

Okay.

So I'm actually focusing my bit on the pivotal event

in which I'm just winning.

Right?

And I'm thinking, okay, what would be my valuation if

I move from losing to if I become from the

second highest base to the first to the highest bid,

what actually should my valuation.

Okay, Here there is a similarity.

At the same time, right here I am conditioning my

vote on the idea that pivotal.

And I'm thinking, what am I learning from the fact

that people tell.

And here it's a nice, you know, uh, feature that

you find pivotal.

Actually I'm thinking when is a time more likely to

arise?

Okay.

And that's the state I'm in.

I'm learning about the state, and that's what I do.

Then there are the issues.

Complicated issues, more complicated issues with the partisans.

But essentially this is the.

Idea.

I would say two things.

What what is reasonable to think about firms with their,

uh, advisers that came from a game theory undergrad class?

Uh, maybe not reasonable to think about people would vote

in large election, especially when we think about, you know,

the results for information aggregation or for n goes to

infinity, maybe in smaller committees, maybe.

Yes.

But it's hard to think that people have this idea

in mind.

Uh.

Second, uh.

Um, if we think about, uh, you know, if you

think about how we started saying we get information aggregation,

recency voting, and then we said, ah, if people are

strategic, sincere voting is not an equilibrium.

So we need to look at the strategic voting equilibrium.

And then we get information.

So at the end of the day okay.

No matter how we look at it, if we somehow

think that people are sincere, we get information.

And if we think that people are strategic we go

to information aggregation.

So do we really need to to look at this

stuff?

Or maybe we can just assume that people are voting

since there is you know, it is nice to know

that even when people are strategic, they they they are

information aggregation properties for large elections.

Okay.

Um.

So what they did with this paper, they spend they

spend a huge literature looking at information aggregation properties.

Um.

So this paper was written in the mid 90s.

There are still papers.

So I just saw a new paper about how someone.

Uh.

Can send, you know, information to such an economy and

manipulate the results so.

That.

They can always because of the strategic value.

Okay?

They can always create a situation in which so sort

of an information design problem, they can they can always

get their preferences.

So even if the state is zero, they can get

a decision for one if this is 1 or 2.

Okay.

Uh zero.

Uh, as I mentioned, when the job market paper was

looking at this question that Alexis raised, that the zero

one.

Uh, candidates and there is a majority for one of

them, then they are elected, but according to the majority,

they are going to interpret them according to how people

vote, so that the information content of the vote and

to move more to the right, if it's a stronger

signal that one, then the decision is, um, that indeed

the state is one and move to the to the

left.

This is the the the information content means that, uh,

zero still is more likely.

And as I said, it's it's very inefficient to use

one vote, both to choose someone.

To choose sort of the position that you start from

and to choose how much you want them to move

on.

Okay.

Uh, again, these candidates are just, you know, they represent

something, but after the election, they just want to move

it over to the right one to them.

Uh, so then you can have equilibria in which totally

the wrong choosing, because people focus more and more of

the coordination issues with the voters, whether we focus more

on signalling more.

Uh.

Selecting the right kind.

So it's just not good.

You can think about this, and it's not good to

try and do two things with one vote.

But it's, you know, this thing that people sometimes use

protest votes or, you know, abstaining as a protest process

or the stuff does give us some idea that there

are some strategic elements like this.

In voting.

Okay.

So would you protect them that if you have more

instruments to choose from, say more different elections?

Yeah.

Yeah, I know because you are able to have a

second meeting and they're like motivated.

It's easier to separate the second link and the selection

process.

So, uh, Evgenia, who just completed her PhD last year,

she went to Edinburgh.

She had a paper in which you have, um, two

dimensions and, uh, on the one is the standard dimension

and the other, it's important to signal that, you know

you really care about this issue or not.

And abstention was a way to actually signal whether you

care about this.

So it depends on how you think about, you know.

You could also signal by abstention.

Okay.

So separating these two things has to also be linked

to what we mean by extension.

These models also if you introduce cost of voting.

Even a small cost if you take the cost to

zero in large populations, the probability that I will actually

be true that when I'm pivotal, I know exactly which

state I'm going to be, but the probability that I'm

going to do that is so small.

That means that the predictions about turnout of these models,

which are is fully mental.

That, you know, the the turnout really converges to be

a really, really small share of the population.

Right?

So we really cannot explain them now.

But it's true that no matter who's the person, if

I want to always signal something, then turnout should increase.

Right.

Because to choose the person and only people, that when

there is a tie to influence their outcome and pivotal

at any configuration falls.

Right?

At all configuration.

Okay.

So I would say maybe as a conclusion of this

that, you know, no matter what you think about what

is the sincere strategic there is information navigation.

Okay.

So I think it is good to know that when

we think about it to be strategic, we get information,

uh, we get information aggregation.

The results also hold when we put some cost of

acquiring information, when preferences are more opportunities.

As I said.

Um.

Okay, take a break.

This is what you need.

So.

Five.

Two.

It's snowing during the night.

No.

Like every day I wake up and I see snow.

But.

It's cold last night.

It's always cold in this country.

It was great.

All right.

I'll go.

Raining this weekend.

This is like the biggest bullshit I've ever seen.

In my life.

It's really raining as well.

We'd like to put them up for our wins.

It's going to be like super windy.

Super storm.

That's amazing.

And then.

On Monday.

On Monday, the sun is coming back.

Like it feels like a joke, you know?

It's like this weekend.

It's pouring.

And then when the weekend will be over, uh, sun

again, you need to go back to uni.

Doesn't matter.

It's the sun.

I'm not like there's the sun.

I mean, yeah, anyways.

Does anyone want anything?

Huh?

Deaf.

Hop emo.

Listen to My Chemical Romance for.

Oh, sorry, I said probably two old records.

Description.

I.

Okay.

Cool.

Oh my God.

Eating like a whole sandwich.

Hungry?

You mean like.

Oh my God.

You know how much I can make?

Huh?

You know how much I can eat?

Yeah.

That's true.

I should not go to that.

No, I got to go to the bathroom and then

do this.

And then I forgot.

I forgot.

To.

Do this.

I was supposed.

To.

Oh, no.

I love doing.

This.

On Instagram because I follow one.

Of those account.

And keep on Like giving them like recommendations on this

one is not the key.

But.

This one that I follow.

Really.

It's always smiling.

Right.

I don't know, like small dogs.

I would never if I had to have a dog,

it would never be a shame.

But this one is incredibly cute.

It does very well for you.

Do you want me to move this?

No, because the other one is this little baby.

Thank you.

I remember.

Maybe we should send a message again about the Christmas

party to the group that.

You.

Just haven't seen today.

I do not think they are.

Why not?

Because this week I know we have to get a

break.

From spending on Wednesday.

Wednesday and Thursday.

And then.

I'm going to do it on Wednesday.

I don't want to do it today.

It was so pretty.

And get drunk.

During the winter break.

I'll probably go away for a bit.

Mostly I just want to focus.

There's a chance at.

All this time, which I'm.

So sorry.

I didn't realise who I was talking to.

What do you mean?

I'm just teasing.

It's just that we decided it was good enough.

I saw like this inside.

Like, huh?

It's important, but I need you.

Where are you going to go?

I'm going to Italy for two weeks.

I'm just trying to find the cheapest way to get

to Italy.

You all right?

I didn't say.

I would not buy it.

I am a trainer.

For many reasons.

I will say first the environment.

Do not say that.

I just don't like my.

Dad.

When he reads go.

I'm not a lot.

Lot.

But I'm not, like, super comfortable playing.

It's okay if I can take the train instead.

Oh, sure.

Okay.

I was just.

Trying to train.

Yeah, I know.

What it's like for times of crisis.

Like.

I think it depends.

See?

Like again, my way back from Italy.

It's just going to be, like, about €60.

No way I could do that.

Like, if you take into consideration Having a suitcase.

Going to the airport.

Instructions.

So.

Just like it depends on the day.

Problem is like I'm going like.

Like after Christmas.

It would be great if I could just skip Christmas

and go on the day of Christmas then.

But I don't think I'm in.

The right.

Spot.

Jesus I come across.

Like you see me like it's just like cycling all

the way from Christ, you know?

Especially like crossing the Alps, I was too, I was

too lazy this morning to take, like, a regular bike

to go like from, like grazing road to here because

I was like, why?

There's a slight.

Like.

so.

And you're just like, I want to do this.

I can make.

This.

Happen.

Okay.

So we spoke about election Selection as, uh, allowing for

information aggregation, uh, the different environments.

And uh, then we said, okay, look, you know, oh,

we didn't say.

We said in the beginning, you look at the.

One of the reasons why we delegate.

Is that we really what we do really in a

society, what we do typically is simply specialised.

Right?

Okay.

So we can't really have people all the time attuned

to collecting information.

Uh, it's just also it's very costly on every decision.

People are going to vote.

It's a very costly mechanism.

Uh.

I mean, general election is a costly mechanism, right?

I mean, given the result, it would be better just

to pick one person at random, right?

Uh.

So.

So, um.

So you really want to, you know, somehow we specialise,

so we choose politicians.

The politicians take decisions on our behalf, and we expect

them to collect information.

Okay.

So then we arrive at environment essentially in which, um.

You know, any politician needs to make a decision.

She needs to collect information.

Potentially from interested parties.

Okay.

Remember, we spoke about the role of, uh, lobbyists and

interest groups.

One of the role of lobbyist is essentially to provide

information to politicians.

Uh, and there is a big conflict of interest between

the interest group in the politician.

But, you know, if this Interscope is representing a particular

type of industry.

Let's go back to the oil that I was discussing

before.

So fossil fuels and you are they did some analysis

and they say it would be very difficult to now

turn, you know, away from fossil fuels.

Uh, it's always there.

Say that.

Right.

So so of course they're, you know, providing a lot

of information through think tanks, paying experts, whatever they're doing

that is, to a degree, biased.

And the politicians need to take this into account.

Okay.

Uh, there is a lot of other actually information stream

in the political system.

Right.

So interest groups also provide information to voters, as we

discussed about politicians or about what is the correct policy.

So they they also do campaigns in which they try

and convince voters in some direction.

Um, but the key problem at the end of the

day is that we have someone that collects the information.

Okay.

Now the politician tries to get information, and, uh, the

interest includes.

But he has has a conflict of interest.

And the party that has the information has a conflict

of interest.

Okay, so, um, last year, the caucus, we talked about

the micro caucus.

Uh, you talked about the chip tock model of information

transmission, in which we have a sender here.

This is the lobby group.

The sender has information.

She has a conflict with the receiver, in this case,

the politician.

Okay.

And if the conflict is too large, information cannot be

translated to credit.

Okay.

This is the result of this.

Of this type of analysis okay.

For example, if the state of the world can be

zero one.

Okay.

So maybe I have low cost for transferring my plants

to be a green plant.

Or maybe I have high cost.

Okay.

As an interest group, I would probably always want to

convince the politicians of the regulatory agency at high cost

so that they subsidise my, uh, my conversion to a

great.

Okay.

So typically, that's how we think about conflicts that you

sort of biased in one particular direction.

You always want to convince the British to take a

decision that gives you more money, for example.

We don't necessarily think about the environment in which in

state zero, you want to convince the politicians it's one

and state one.

You want to call it zero.

That is a strange you know, you may be able

to think about it, even, you know, lobby group like

that just to confuse.

Okay.

Maybe it's maybe okay.

But typically we just think about sort of bias in

a particular direction compared to the rest of the public.

We are biased in a particular direction.

We think about the lecture about the contributions.

The interest groups were biased in particular direction.

That's what they want to do.

They want to move it better.

Okay.

So the paper that I'm going to look at.

Takes this idea.

Okay.

And applies this to a particular political economy, uh, institution

That is, committees in Congress.

Right.

Okay.

Committees is also in general.

I mean, a lot of decision making is done.

Committees.

It's an interesting organisation to think about.

Okay.

How much specialisation do you want in a committee?

You know, why do we have committees rather than individuals.

So again, like with election we think about committees because

we have more information coming from people.

Okay.

Um.

But let me describe the actual process that goes on

between committees and and Congress.

So what happens when what happens is that essentially the

only way to offer a bill to the Congress to

change a law is something.

Okay.

It's a committee.

Okay.

So the committee needs to explore the ideas is first.

Okay.

And then to suggest a bill.

To the Congress.

Okay.

And now the Congress is the decision maker.

Okay.

So a bit like the politics that all politicians have

a different.

So the Congress, which is composed of many more people,

right, needs to make a decision.

So there are two types of procedure.

One procedure is that you take the bill and then

you start an amendment process okay.

And the amendment could go on and on and on

and on.

At the end of the day, the new bill that

arises, you know, is not recognisable as the as the

original.

Okay.

So essentially in this process.

It's a, it's a, you know, there are rules that

determine the evolution of the process.

But in this process, the Congress takes the bill and

then decides what they want.

Okay.

And there is another process in which the Congress can

only choose between the bill and the status quo.

Okay.

Okay.

So what's the relation of all of these to formation?

So the committee you know, the committee sees experts the

committee.

I sort of agree with a lot of information.

Okay.

We assume that the committee is a unitary expert and

the Congress is unitary, actually manifested by the media.

So committee, the committee.

The committee takes all this information, uses its own preference.

So In general, think of the median voter in the

committee.

It's not going to be decided.

Okay.

Actually, committees are a way for, you know, parties to

somehow, uh, benefit each other and reach some deals.

So we allow even those that from the party that

didn't have a majority in Congress to get some members

in important.

It's a way for the party central authority to give

perks to some members.

So there's some committees which are super important, and then

you just get more campaign contributions, or you get more

ability to help your voters from your constituency.

Okay.

So the committee that has the nice mysterious name and

then means committee, that's the best committee to be yet

another important decision down there.

Okay.

So so it's you know, and people go to there

are many committees, and it's just unlikely that we actually

each committee, we're going to be able to replicate the

mean of the president of the Congress by the mean,

it's just not going to be the case.

Okay.

So there will be a potential conflict of interest between.

So now let's think of you little reactor okay.

Person here.

Okay.

And now the bill.

Essentially the bill is going to be some manifestation of

the information that the committee has gained.

Okay.

So the committee has explored there is some state of

the world in the background.

The committee has explored what is the state of the

world.

And the committee will, you know, in a sincere world,

the committee will suggest the bill that fits the preference

of the medium here according to the state of them.

Right?

Okay.

So think of this word for a second.

And this is Since they were the bill.

Reflect fully reflect the information of the Committee.

So the meeting of the Congress can do is in

this process what the meeting of the Congress can do

is to send essentially if extract this information, right, and

then design a bill that uses this information in accordance

with its own.

Okay.

So understanding this, it may be the case that the

committee.

In some extreme cases in which the conflict is too

large.

The committee will, you know, essentially understand whatever.

You know, they don't really want to give information.

Okay.

Because it will be used against it.

Okay.

And that essentially means that.

And think about the information aggregation process for them.

It's a costly process.

Okay.

So it might be better for them actually extended not

to acquire any information at all.

Right.

So if information is costly it's of course costly in

terms of time and effort and reading stuff.

It's you know, okay, we have some prior on the

state of the world.

I'm just going to suggest to you it'd be the

right to do whatever you want, because if I'm going

to go through this process at the end, the information

is going to be used roughly against me.

Okay.

There is no point for me to to go through

this process.

And the basic sender receiver theory games.

People don't look at information confusion.

Just say we have information and they reach a conclusion

that sometimes when the conflict is too large information, the

equilibrium don't involve any meaningful information transmission.

Okay.

Because essentially I it's like I'm fearing that you're lying

to me.

Okay.

So then the equilibrium.

Sometimes called babbling equilibrium, whatever you whatever the sender is

saying the receiver ignores.

And given that the receiver ignores the sender says and

send the message is meaningless.

Okay.

So if you think about this, when you think about

individuals that you have to acquire information, if they are

in this situation, they're not going to acquire information.

So that's clearly a message.

But then the point of this next paper is to

say, look, what happens if the Congress can't go through

all this process, but can only choose between the bill

and the status quo?

What are we doing here?

We're essentially giving the committee the power that the committee

has is not only in aggregating information, the power that

they have.

Essentially, we are delegated to them some decision power, right,

because they know that the floor of the Congress control

everyone.

The Congress can only decide between the status quo.

And so it's like a gender making power, right?

I can only, you know, this is the agenda.

You can't you can't have this.

Okay.

So what's the usefulness of that?

The usefulness of that is that essentially, the Congress is

limited in using the information, manipulating the bill in its

own preferences so the committee knows that some of its

preferences might be actually served properly.

Okay, depending on how they design the view.

Okay.

And that gives them an incentive to, to, uh, to

acquire information.

Okay.

So the power of delegation with some partial delegation, some

form of partial delegation, delegation can actually improve the process.

Example in terms of welfare for everyone okay.

Because we're going to get some informative bits of information

would be acquired more efficiently and aggregated.

Okay.

That's the bird's eye view.

And when we go through the details.

You can think about this exactly the same way to

us.

When we choose a politician to represent us, we want

the politician to specialise in aggregate information.

For every decision, the politician would say, okay, this is

what I think you should do, then there's going to

be a referendum then, okay, the whole delegation power is

taken away and people need some incentives to to, uh.

To serve the preferences.

Okay.

So here is the model.

What we need in the model is again we need

uncertainty.

We need information acquisition.

And we need some conflict of interest.

Okay.

So policy chosen is denoted by p.

And then the final outcome is going to be p

plus omega.

And omega is the state of the world.

So that's a random random variable distributed uniformly on zero

and one.

So we want to know omega because that's like a

shock to the outcome okay.

The ideal policy of the floor Congress is zero.

And that of the committee is biased okay.

And the utility is a quadratic single peak.

So what does this mean.

It means that if I know omega and if I'm

the floor what I want, if I know omega then

I want to choose p equals minus omega.

Then I get zero as the outcome.

And if I'm the committee.

Uh.

I would like x to be p plus omega.

So I would like to choose the equals exhibition.

Okay, so it was.

Something more to a higher place.

Good X is positive.

Okay.

And you can have lots of models of how to

acquire information.

Typically we think that the more you invest, uh the

better is your signal.

Okay.

So here is a rough, stark assumption.

If you invest some level K then you fully learn

okay.

Okay.

So we have two options.

Either to invest zero and then you know nothing beyond

the prior which is just the uniform distribution.

Or you invest in you know everything.

Okay.

And it's common knowledge if you invest it or not.

Okay.

That's a bit tricky.

But you know when.

So maybe the Congress knows that the committee sits down

for its meetings.

Uh, but maybe people didn't invest anything.

They just sit there and just, you know, drink coffee,

biscuits.

Um.

But assuming that there are always people on both sides,

there would be enough probably information filtering somehow to Congress

knowing whether the people actually explanation or not.

Maybe the commission costly reports from scientists observed.

So once we sort of start the communication going through

the bills, we know what level of information the committee

has.

We don't know.

Omega itself is the Congress, but we know whether the

committee knows Omega.

So there is common knowledge on that.

Okay.

So that's.

Okay.

So the committee decides whether to acquire information.

Then it offers a bill that is denoted by B.

The bill is potentially a message about Omega carries a

message about Omega.

If the strategy, for example, is that, you know, again,

as I noted before, if the strategy is that the

bill is sincere for the community, so it's always x

minus w, then we can find out, given that we

know x, the Congress can find out that.

Okay.

If the committee does not acquire information, then the committee

has no, uh, nothing to tell us in the bill.

Okay.

And then.

Okay.

And then I'm now describing this, essentially this first process

that I take, whatever the committee takes, I can change

to whatever I want.

Okay.

So Especially if they didn't acquire information.

Then, as the Congress, I'm just choosing just the average.

Uh.

States minus the states.

Okay.

In which case with the quadratic utilities, essentially the exact

utility of the Congress is just the variance, okay, minus

the variance because we thought of that utility.

So just mean variance.

Um, sort of getting the mean in expectations and but

whatever is the state okay.

I'm always different than the than the generic State.

And so, uh, this difference is exactly the variance.

So I'm using the variance from the point of the

committee.

I'm losing the variance and the bias.

Right.

Because the decision is always further away by x amount

or whatever.

Okay.

So this is the case in which no information is

collected.

And if we look at the information that is collected.

Okay let me just skip all this skip all these

details.

I'm just going to assume that x is large enough

so that the equilibrium is such that there is never

information transmission.

Okay.

So the conflict is too large.

There is no information transmission.

Okay.

And I'm going to focus about analysing this.

Okay.

Okay, so one results from the sort of theoretical literature

if X is for confidence.

If X is large enough, then, uh, the bill is

meaningless in the sense that.

So in this case in which the Congress has all

the power, or Congress has a gender power.

There is no information transmission, no credible information transmission.

Communication is not possible because of the large conflict of

interest.

I can't believe the centre, the the committee.

Uh, and so what we have is that the committee

doesn't invest.

Okay, now let's think about this agenda power.

So if I'm offering a bill, the floor is to

choose between this and the status quo.

It's really like a take it or leave it bargain,

right?

You either take the status quo or the B.

Okay, so what can I do here?

I can give you imagine that.

I'm actually I'm actually giving you a bill that allows

you to find the state of the world.

Okay.

So somehow there is meaningful information transmission in equilibrium, but

in some regions of the of the state.

Okay.

Are you still happier?

Even if you learn about the state, you still happier

to take the pill rather than the stuff.

Okay.

You would like to do better, but you can't.

You can even take this.

Okay.

When we say there is a two large conflict of

interest, we don't mean that.

You know, essentially what we mean is that let's say

the state can only be zero one.

Okay.

Okay.

The state can be zero one.

If x is sufficiently large.

Okay.

Even zero types would like to say that there are

one right to make the converse to something higher.

Okay.

But for the one types there is no conflict for

one type.

Meaning when you when the committee knows that the state

is one, There is no conflict of interest with the

floor, because that's the highest possible state of the highest

possible action.

The lowest here that the state can, that the Congress

can take.

Okay.

So I would actually like to tell the Congress the

state is one.

Okay.

But it's not credible because also the zero type will

mean.

So the Congress is afraid that also when the state

is zero, I'm saying.

Right.

So when we said that the conflict is too large

and the concrete is large, but there are states for

which both sides would somehow like to communicate.

So that's what's going to happen here for the environments

in which there is some more common interest.

We would manage to provide an informative deal.

So these allowing the agenda power we give them, we

give them, uh, an incentive to acquire information.

Okay.

So the status quo is going to be denoted by

P0.

Okay.

So P0 is the sensor score.

And I'm just going to give you one particular equilibrium.

Okay.

P0 is negative.

Uh.

Right.

We're looking at negative policies.

Right?

Because the outcome is because.

Okay.

Okay.

So think about w going from 0 to 1.

Okay.

So the first region to think about.

Let's think about.

This for a second.

If w is between zero and.

Minus three x minus b zero.

Then actually the committee is going to offer a bill

which perfectly suits preferences and perfectly reveals this thing.

Okay.

Let's let's look at this.

Let's say, you know, WB0, for example.

Let's think of the Congress with the.

Ideal.

Policy at zero.

The status quo is minus p zero.

The state is.

Zero.

If they pick up this bill, what they get is,

uh.

X, right?

Okay.

But under the assumption that there exists such a region,

this is positive.

Okay.

So actually P0 absolute value is much larger than x

x here.

Okay.

So they're actually very happy to go with this.

Okay.

This is the basic idea that okay between this we

have a common interest.

Okay.

For this date, we have a comment.

Given the status quo for this state, we have a

common interest.

Let's look at the other extreme minus three x minus

p zero.

If I stay with the status quo or what am

I getting I'm getting uh, minus p zero plus three

x plus p zero.

So I'm getting three x.

Also minus.

So it's always the policy plus three.

Okay.

If I'm taking what the community wants.

Then I'm getting this.

So getting X.

Always getting vaccine.

Okay.

And in fact, uh.

I think this is.

This is larger than x.

Again, under the assumption that this is positive this is

going to be normal.

That's okay.

This is positive.

I'm adding I'm subtracting another bit.

Okay.

Okay.

So there is a region in which actually the bill

reflects exactly the preferences of the committee.

So that's how the bill looks like until some point

okay.

Until some point in which.

There is full information revelation until some point in which

actually the Congress is still inclined to take whatever the

committee wants.

But but at this point, full information revolution stops.

In the next region.

The committee offers something fixed.

Go ahead and finish describing the equilibrium.

And then we can go through this in the next

region.

Okay.

The committee offers some.

Summary.

Something okay.

And in the final region, again the state is sort

of extreme enough so that we have.

Uh, another x minus on.

Actually.

Also, if, for example, like here in the final region,

if the state is one, this is minus p zero

okay.

Minus p zero minus one would be further away okay.

Whereas x itself.

Is.

Is.

We already know that x is preferred to minus p

zero.

Okay.

So x minus one plus one two.

We fixed the x.

So it's better for strictly better for.

This region these two together in which we are in

the middle of the road here okay.

Now if you reveal omega Okay, it's going to be

the case that minus B zero plus omega is going

to end up closer than x okay.

Not everywhere.

Okay.

As we said there is this region that there is

still a common okay.

So what happens in this middle region?

In this middle region I'm pulling together states on which

there is a conflict and states in which there is

a common interest.

So then the average of this interval okay.

So the committee, the Congress knows that when I'm sending

this message, we are in this interval.

The average of this interval just makes the committee in

different between choosing my proposal.

And so that's why I need here regions in which

actually, you know, I could have transmitted the state uh,

there is enough common interest here.

Okay?

Otherwise, if all of this would be a conflict of

interest, I wouldn't mention transmit anything.

Okay.

In this region, the conflict is too large.

Okay.

So what happens here?

I come out with some bill.

The bill that I'm sending tells the committee that we're

in this region.

But in this region, the committee committee can't use this

information.

The only thing the committee can choose is the status

quo.

Okay, so here I'm offering a bill.

Essentially, the committee knows we're here and then they choose

the senators.

So I give up on this region I guess it's

the score.

But I guess here a region in which I put

some state, uh, and I get, you know, a bill

that I relatively like, it's not fine tuned to the

state, but.

Okay.

So by giving agenda to the committee, we manage to

utilise regions of the state in which there is a

common interest compared to the status quo.

Okay.

There's never, you know, I could always do better as

the Congress, if the state is revealed and I choose

exactly what I want.

Right.

Because now I'm getting I'm getting X, okay.

It's not ideal for me.

I'm getting you know, the committee is getting what they

want.

I'm getting minus x.

All right.

Okay.

So we utilise these areas of information uh, for sort

of more, more common interest compared to the status quo.

In this area, again, we get something that takes state

of the world into consideration.

Partially.

Okay.

And this is too much.

Okay, so what does this give?

The fact that the committee can get what it wants

in some regions implies that now.

So this is a particular equilibrium.

There might be others, but within this equilibrium they show

that the committee collects information.

So Spence K.

And moreover.

So of course the committee here is better off okay.

Otherwise they wouldn't acquire the information.

So given that we know that they collect information, we

know that they are better off than the no informative.

Agreement.

Because the outcome in terms of bills would be the

same if they don't collect information, but they decide to

call it.

They must be there before they can always decide not

to.

Okay, so the community is better off.

And naturally, of course, you know the.

Majority.

But what we need to check is that potentially excellent.

Also, the Congress is better off to justify this rule.

So it's a bit tricky because we're focusing here on

x that is large enough so that there is a

conflict and we can't transmit information when we when we

don't have this rule.

Okay.

So that means that in this region in which the

state is revealed, the Congress is getting something that is

quite biased.

Okay.

So I think this is quite fast.

Okay.

On the other hand, the Congress that is getting is

getting something that fits the state of the world, insufficient

sufficiently in a region at least partially.

So they save on variants.

Okay.

But they get, you know, a bias on the knee.

And then they show that there are regions, uh, of

ethics in which the Congress is also happy about, sufficiently

happy about, uh, about this equilibrium.

And so we will prefer this particular agenda.

Okay.

So the idea here is to.

Explain first, what is the role of committees in Congress?

Okay.

So we say, okay, the role of committees is to

collect information, uh, but to explain the particular rules that

we see as facilitating information acquisition and information translation transmission.

So more informative, more informative, uh, is legislation so interpreting

particular type of institution as one that enables, enables, create

incentives for information acquisition.

We explain why we have agenda making power or why

we have delegation.

So it's tricky with delegation because delegation is there to

solve problems of communication.

Communication is worse when people have bigger conflict.

But that also means that delegation is worse.

When we have bigger conflict.

Okay.

Right.

Because it means that the decisions that you will take

are very far away from the decision that I will

take.

It's not easy to have to resolve this, trade-off and

to see whether you want to delegate.

In cases in which the person is very different from

you, or when you want to delegate to the person,

is very similar to both.

Communication will be better when the person is similar to

you, and the decision that they will take when you

delegate.

Okay.

What's nice about this mechanism is sort of a mechanism

of partial delegation.

So I'm not fully, you know, giving you all the

delegation power.

You're not choosing the bill.

I still retain a very reasonable application of very reasonable

power.

That is, I can always choose the status quo.

Okay.

But you have the power to create budget.

If you think more seriously about what the status quo

is coming from.

Uh, it's, you know, it came from the previous decision.

If it was the same committee, then we have a

dynamic issue here.

I mean, when I offer a bill that is successful,

I know it also becomes the status quo for the

next decision.

It's not going to be exactly the same type of

decision.

But.

You know, sometimes the state changes, right?

We know that there's a change and we need to

change the law.

So we have to think about dynamic issues with status

quo, which are quite.

Interesting.

Uh.

So, but I think it's a really nice idea that

a gender making power essentially rises endogenous.

Okay.

In some environment we would want to have this institution,

uh, of course, you know, all these primitive of the

model X and the status quo, uh, the prior distribution

of the state, all of this stuff changes from one

problem to the other.

Right?

So the position of the media in the committee depends

on exactly what we are deciding and all of this

stuff.

But you can take some ex-ante view and say, okay,

for this committee, we are going to have these types

of problems.

And if you think ex-ante, Sunday.

Do we want to create this agenda making power?

Uh, also, given the foreseeable cost of information, that can

also change between problems or sort of only, of course,

suggestive, you know, this idea, but.

The other way is to create partial delegation.

You could say, okay, in the Constitution, the Constitution says

something that you could never offer bills lower than this

or higher than this, right?

So essentially you're sort of giving or those that formalise

the Constitution delegates to the next generation partial power of,

you know, the thing.

You want to give some power because the state might

change and people have different information.

But you may not want to give too much power

because of what your preference.

Is in some parliaments.

So in the UK we have these select committees.

And if they commission a scientific report then it has

to be published.

Right.

So that's like a commitment.

So, so part of the information that you write.

So part of the information that you acquire has to

be published.

But uh, so what happens to all the transcripts of

the committee decisions?

I don't know if, um, I think.

Uh, it depends on I think there's like, national security

restrictions, about half the population.

Okay.

Yeah.

What's that?

Well, the stuff that happens within the committee.

Yeah.

Obviously, if.

You guys watch the video, it's quite fun sometimes.

Yeah.

No, no.

I mean, of course there are some public committee hearings

also to watch.

Um.

Um, but I'm.

Just wondering what that information, if you have commitment or

commitment as an institution that does that, that presumably Jesus.

Well, you answer it.

I think the thing is that the committee still has

some power.

Of what type of information to commission, right?

Okay.

Yeah.

So I can somehow bias the experts in consulting with

scientific reports and commission.

Um, but I have questions that I'm asking.

So I think there is a trade off between.

Fully publishing all the information that the committee.

And then if the committee is biased from the parliament,

the committee.

Will.

May require information.

In a in a.

Particular direction, of course.

I understand this, but.

So it's like.

A, like a, like.

An information design problem in which I'm sort of biasing

the experiment.

Um.

So it's a signal, but it's not.

Yeah.

It can never be fully formed.

It's.

Because.

Yeah.

Otherwise it's not clear.

Yeah.

It has to be, you know, you have to give

a role to the community.

And the role would be to decide in which information.

So it is.

Like an.

Information question.

So I know that everything will be published so I

can design the experiment.

So in this model, if I can retain some information,

I mean, if I can retain some information, supposedly give

me too much power, but if I can't really use

it, it's not good.

But if I can use this power, then, uh, you

know, one equivalent.

You know, you.

Can think that in this region.

Indeed.

I'm designing a signal that gives full information, right?

As long as I can still retain this agenda.

But in this problem, they can't choose the experiment.

No, this is.

What I said.

This was before.

Information.

This.

This is 87.

I think it's quite advanced for.

This is a paper in political science.

Interesting use of.

Coffins of.

Cheap.

Cheap, cheap.

Okay.

But obviously so, you know, there is a lot, uh.

So I would like to use the next two lectures

to talk more about behavioural political economy.

And if you think seriously about, again, information, behavioural context,

there is a lot of information aggregation politics and uh,

or a lot of information miss aggregation.

Uh, and it's important to think actually more.

In.

The, in terms of the cognitive ability to aggregate information

and cognitive ability to distinguish real news from fake news

or this type of stuff.

So I want, you know, I want to talk about

all of this stuff, but it's sort of where the

literature is going.

Okay.

Uh.

The literature on, uh, echo chambers, uh, how, you know,

how do we get the information?

Um, there is so much information out there.

Uh.

Information manipulation seems to be quite rife.

So I think this also gives us this idea, gives

us also, you know, in the presence of problems of

information aggregation, how can we design institutions?

Okay.

So it's a simple example of this.

There is a problem of information aggregation.

Information is not acquired and not exhibited.

How can we design the institution so that we are

more immune to this?

So if we think about more current problems that relate

to manipulation of information, fake news and so on.

We may also want to think about, you know, new

ways or new types of organisations that will help us

to, to deal with.

This.

To deal with this issue.

In a setting in which individuals have somehow access to

more information Today without saying that the information is accurate

or biased, but they do realise they have more access

to information, so they think they're more informed, right?

It shouldn't like it feels like, for instance, in the

first model that you presented today.

Yeah.

Um, it's those who they know, they're uninformed.

And so they are saying, yeah, but those who are

informed, they they do go vote according to that information.

So shouldn't we somehow witness way that people now are

voting more because they think they're more informed and not

necessarily more informed, but they do think that.

Right.

Is there anything on this?

Uh.

I mean, I have, uh, one paper with.

Me.

When.

We look at the effect of correlation neglect.

So if you have a lot of signals like like

the correlation in the signal, so you think they are

independent, then you think that you are more informed than

you really are because there is a lot of correlation

information to get.

And it's very difficult to say thank you.

But, uh, we don't look at, uh, turnout.

We just look at, you know, we we make everyone

vote.

And if you vote, uh, you know, 0 to 1.

Okay.

Uh, the result is that sometimes if voters actually do

better because at least they vote.

Thank you.

So it all depends on how much, uh, marginal votes

out there.

You want voters to use their information.

And sometimes if you think you truly have only one

signal, you're not even going to going to vote accordingly.

And it doesn't outweigh your prior power.

Fine.

Uh.

Then, uh.

You may think that you are very informed that if

you have confirmation bias.

Okay, so it depends.

You you really have to take a stand on where

is this coming from?

I think people think that they are more informed.

Okay, so confirmation bias, you get one signal, you are

biased in one direction, then the other signal that you

get, you somehow interpret according to your feelings.

That's another way to get.

Um.

So this this.

And that, uh, this can create more polarisation and.

I don't think there is a lot.

So definitely not about turnout.

I will say.

I think empirically we do see some increase in China.

But that could also be because of polarisation.

Right?

So one reason again that people think when people think

about why do I vote?

I think okay, I.

If I think the option on the other side is

much worse, then I should come to vote.

If you got a small.

Boat, Well, then.

Maybe I ignore the fact that I'm different and not

just, you know, if there is too much difference between

the options I want to do.

But the polarisation could be based on this idea that

I actually feel that they're more informed.

It's not obvious what.

I see, but I know much better what the other

side is going to do, and it's very bad for

me.

It's very hard to distinguish.

Uh.

There is data.

There's like, all the people are more, uh, have more

stronger beliefs in the information than how it is.

Okay.

Uh.

Okay.

Maybe I'll put on Moodle something.

Thank you.

How's it going?

I'm tired.

Made our tick tock this morning.

My goodness.

Congrats.

Did you do yours yet or did you post?

It's not due until it's ready.

Yeah, it's too much time I gave it.

I got a little essay to write, which would be

fun.

Which class?

Um.

Urban politics.

It's due tomorrow, so I'm stumped about that.

What?

How many words?

A thousand, so easy money.

I'm just gonna start fresh.

Wake up at it.

And then you know what you're gonna write about?

Yeah.

Fiscal crises in Minnesota.

Sounds so boring.

It's terribly exciting.

Minneapolis.

Amazing.

Yeah.

The best city in the.

World.

I was wondering if you live there for a second.

I figure I try to be biased for Minnesota.

Yeah.

For Minneapolis.

Oh.

It's a wonderful city.

I don't think I'll live there.

Oh, my God, I live there.

We can do this.

Hello?

You.

All right.

I got the economics policy exam back.

But I don't like it.

He just wants more definition.

And I also just.

Like.

To be.

Like 30 minutes.

The GOP candidates.

For that.

Position just get.

Her crunchy cookies.

I made Charlie.

Lecture 9:

We?

Bury them.

I love the game.

I.

Hey, guys.

Hey.

I have some food and drinks.

Okay.

Good morning.

Um, so I want to devote it to the next

two lectures to.

Sort of looking at, uh, interaction of behavioural economics and

political economy.

Um.

Again, motivated by the same questions that we sort of

were looking at, which are preference aggregation by different institutions

and information aggregation by the different institutions and particular we

typically looked at also the application of redistribution.

Okay.

So sort of the same thread that I had in

the first lecture that we look at different institutions, but

essentially we're interested to see what is the actual economic

outcome.

When we looked at the preference aggregation with the interest

groups.

You know, we realised that the outcomes are not the

best for the general population.

Uh, when we looked at parties, we looked at how

those in the multi dimensional policy space outcomes for general

distribution, uh, are potentially, uh, biased.

Um, so now I'm going to in the first lecture,

I also mentioned sort of alternative explanation to the question

of why don't the poor expropriate?

So why don't we have a high taxes?

Really.

We should go into, uh, median voter preferences.

So I looked to the explanation of looking at different

beliefs and culture.

So this is roughly what we're going to do today.

Okay.

Look at these types of alternative explanations that use elements

of uh, formation of beliefs, uh, or elements that create

some bias in the preferences of individuals.

And hence we don't get what we should expect according

to.

Okay.

So in general, in behavioural economics, sort of the two

types of deviations from the rational individual.

One is that we looked we looked at other preferences

okay.

So we simply assume that there are other preferences, right?

I mean, a lot of experiments that we do on,

uh, very basic models in game theory.

These experiments don't give us the outcome that we predict.

And, you know, it's not a surprise.

We know for myself that we don't always behave like,

uh, we don't always only maximise our immediate, uh, utility.

We may have other considerations in mind.

We may care about other people.

Uh, maybe we compare our utility to some reference point

utility and so on.

Okay.

So there are many ways to introduce other preferences.

Um.

So one of the explanation that I would look at

today to sort of why we should expect redistribution that

is different from Milton and Richard would relate to the

fact that, uh, I may adopt different preferences, given different

group identity that I'm going to, that I'm going to

adopt.

Okay.

What is the challenge with thinking about different preferences?

So I would say, um, because the standard in economics

is sort of the rational, selfish utility model.

One challenge is to somehow justify the different preferences that

we're doing, uh, either by alluding to, you know, psychological,

sociological literature.

The second challenge is sort of from a point of

view of sort of, you know, thinking about an interesting

theory.

If we just assume, you know, we want to explain

something and we just assume these are the preferences of

people, you know, this is not this is not great.

Okay.

Um, for example, if we have an observation that the

more diverse society we have a lower level of distribution.

One explanation that was given is that simply individuals don't

want to redistribute to others that are different from that.

They just have a taste against this version.

Okay?

I mean, you can accept this, but, uh, you know,

and maybe it's true, um, just wouldn't be an interesting.

Okay, and, uh, potentially arbitrary because you can also assume

the opposite.

Okay.

So, uh.

So we can put the behavioural element here, the preference,

the primitive of the preferences, or we can put the

behavioural element or we in, in in how individuals process

information.

Right.

To achieve a rational decision you need to, you know,

maximise your preferences and take into consideration all the possible

information that you have.

And there are many types of behavioural biases with cognitive

biases that, uh, correspond to.

To, uh.

To how we process all the information around us.

Okay.

Um, some familiar biases.

Uh, selection bias.

Right.

So individuals don't realise that the information that they get

is from a selected sample.

Okay.

So, for example, when we think what people want and

we only talk to the people around us and we

don't realise that they may have the same preferences, uh,

or the same information, that we have the same preferences

that we have.

Uh, which is why these are the people that we

talk to.

Okay, so maybe there is some homophily, uh, in the

set of people around us.

And we think that this represents the.

Confirmation bias is another bias identified in the psychological literature

that somehow you the initial information that you get is

sort of is determines the way in which you interpret

all other information.

Correlation neglect relates to the idea that, uh, there is

a lot of information around us that is potentially correlated.

If you think about the information that you get in

social media, a lot of it is sort of repeated

to a degree, but of course repackaged in different ways.

Uh, so there are sort of paper papers in media

economics that show how the information content of, uh, a

lot of what we get is highly correlated.

Um, within, you know, milliseconds, a lot of messages are

simply repackaged and sent again.

And so it's very difficult to know, you know, to

understand the correlation structure of code.

There is a third bias, which I wouldn't think is

encompassed by the first two that I described, which is

simply whether we behave strategically.

Right.

We assume that, you know, okay, you maximise your preferences.

So this this all this is relevant for individual decisions.

But once we are in a, in an environment with

other people and we are in a strategic environment, it's

not obvious that we behave strategically.

And indeed in political economy, one of the basic assumptions

that we typically accept, the fact that the voters more

sincerely right this time, why are they voting in first

place?

Uh, you know, and it's an empirical question.

In some elections, voters vote strategically.

Sometimes they coordinate on if if two parties on the

left suggest candidate, maybe voters manage to coordinate by themselves.

Maybe parties do that.

Um, but it's actually political.

Economy is one of the first field to adopt a

behavioural assumption, which is that since they formed very, very

early, uh, in general, if we think about how individuals

play games, the degree of strategic thinking could vary, right?

Uh, you could just not think about the other side,

or you can think about the other side to a

degree.

Or you may not realise if we are playing a

game.

Uh, so last time we talked, for example, about the

pivotal voter idea and the fact that I have to

condition on being pivotal.

Uh, but if you don't realise that other voters are

using their information to vote, so you may want to

use your information deciding how to vote.

And you may think about the event in which you

are pivotal, but you are not counting.

Uh, as you should, how other voters are using their

information to vote, and this effect is going to be

weak.

So, uh, an observation of sincere voting could come both

because, you know, people just want that the reason why

they vote is maybe to show the preferences, or maybe

they vote with their information sincerely, because they actually don't

understand that other voters are using their information and they

don't have all the sophisticated machinery that we were looking

at last.

Now, the challenges here are that, uh, as I said,

you know, you can have one of these cognitive biases.

Let's say let's say you justified it.

You looked at the psychological literature, but at the same

time, we may assume that in a game, okay, individuals

are again super rational and they they understand very well.

So there is some tension between the two buses.

The last two buses that I described first is how

I use my information, or what type of stuff, and

whether I'm actually behaving in a strategic way, uh, strategic

or strategic interaction.

Let me rephrase this, this, this tension a little bit

more carefully.

Let's think of even just one individual decision maker, okay.

I may be a sophisticated person with confirmation bias or

a naive person confirmation bias.

What would be the difference?

I have confirmation bias.

But the question is, for example, do I realise that

I will fall into the trap?

You know that there is no way that I would

not fall into the trap of confirmation bias.

And so when I plan, for example, how much information

to acquire in the first place, if I realise this,

or if I'm sophisticated, then I will acquire information in

one particular way that is different than what I would

do if I am naive in the sense that I

don't really.

So once we open up the Pandora's box of allowing

for biases, there are a lot of, you know, a

lot of possibilities because there is a lot of tension,

because between the way we analyse difficultly, analyse decision making

and, uh, or strategic environment, the type of tools.

Yes, you mentioned it, but what is it different?

What is the rationale?

Inattention bias?

Rational inattention is uh, these are models of sophisticated individuals

in this.

does exactly in the sense that I describe that realise

they have some problem.

Okay.

Particularly the problem in rational attention is that I know

that I cannot pay attention to everything.

Okay, okay.

So I know that I will have some, some, uh,

restriction or constraint on my ability to process information or

pay attention to information and so rationally in advance, okay.

In advance, what I do is choose how to allocate

my bounded okay.

It's like a response to a behavioural bias.

It's in response to have a bias.

It's like being sophisticated or my behavioural bias.

The bias here there is like a the literature also

has like, uh, artificial, uh, artificial distinction between what we

would call behavioural economics and what we call bounded rationality.

Okay.

Just because of historical, uh, so a lot of, uh,

theories that looked into this, you know, didn't because we

have a economics was also about changing preferences.

So they said, look, of course we have memory constraints.

And so they just viewed it as a constraint.

Right.

Constraint on my cognitive ability okay.

The constraint on my cognitive ability, let's say I can

only pay attention to one dimension of the political space.

Let's say okay.

And parties may differ on different, uh, elements.

Okay.

So rationally I'm going to choose on which dimension to

focus on.

Okay.

But it's just the behavioural bias is just modelled as

a constraint okay.

So I know I will be able to remember only

three things.

So in advance I'm choosing which three elements of the

product description I'm going to look at.

So it's not it's.

It's really like a it's it's really just a language.

For the.

Language.

And then would you think somehow I think.

You know.

You can look at it I think all this stuff

is sort of just associated with people being less clever,

but really, I mean, you know, again, you are facing

such a complex web of information.

There is no way, of course, there's no way that

we know all the links in the network when we

send information, information next to us.

So it's just a yeah.

So I don't like the fact that there is a

distinction, but historically that's how.

So because a lot of people that did behave in

economics were more inclined and theorists that at the beginning

were sort of averse to behavioural economics and wanted to

maintain more structure.

So just looked at this stuff as constraint rather than

rather than science.

For example, in a there were old papers, I don't

remember, in the 80s, maybe they looked at playing an

infinite, uh, prisoner's dilemma, okay.

But with limited memory.

And so that's in a sense, also an element of

behavioural, in the sense that it's not you're not fully

rational.

But this was categorised under bounded.

Okay.

Good.

Okay.

So.

So we're going to look at sort of one way

in which we're changing the preferences and how it affects

redistribution.

Okay.

And this is this.

Well the model of identity.

Okay.

So there there are several.

Several ways to think about identity.

So most of the literature in economics thinks about identity

as something that individuals sort of, uh, impose on themselves.

Okay.

They like to identify with a group, they want to

identify with the group.

And only about which group are you choosing to identify?

Okay.

I would think that in a lot of political environment,

a lot of the identity is not necessarily self imposed

but imposed externally.

Okay.

So people may see me as a woman or they

see me as an economist or theorist and bundle whatever

stereotype they have theories on.

And.

You know, sense in a lot of models, we sort

of, uh, use identity as a way to, to target

individuals, right?

By particular specific special redistribution.

Right.

So if there is geographical diversity, we can target individuals

with that.

Uh, so the more observable features that we have on

individuals, the easier it is to society or for governments

to target these individuals for particular treatment.

Good or bad.

So geographical is obvious.

Income, of course, is a little bit more difficult, but

it is something that is used.

Um.

Okay.

We hear a lot of the phrase identity politics.

Um, so it's a very sort of politically loaded, right?

Actually was was, uh, coined in the 80s as a

response by Republicans in the US to civil rights movement.

That's saying, okay, they, you know, they just focus on

their identity and they want particular.

Um.

I'm thinking of types of essentially targeting or redistribution.

Another, another way to view this is to say, okay,

people form a particular interest group according to their particular

interest.

If they feel that.

They don't get they should get better treatment.

Uh.

Yeah.

And and.

So I guess when people think about interest groups for,

you know, forming for economic interest, it seems reasonable and

natural to them.

But if they form a long lines that they don't

think have economic, uh.

Significance.

You know, sort of disregarded, which, you know, so first,

it's not obvious that it's not economic interest.

And second, so if you talk about the freedom to

work, you know, equal work, uh, rights and so on,

equal treatment at work and so on.

Um.

And second, you know, again, human rights and stuff like

this.

I mean, I don't see the difference between.

But more generally there are I think I've alluded to

this maybe less of two lectures ago when we talked

about multi dimensional policy space.

A lot of times there are sort of dichotomy between

cultural preferences and economic preferences.

I think there there is obviously some degree of independence,

but also a lot of correlation also, because again, if

you know, uh, the issue of, uh, immigrants, okay, you

know, it's sometimes people describe it as, uh, I want

to live in an environment when people have the same

habits like me or, but, you know, of course, it's

also an issue.

Of.

Economic issues.

Or if women are not able to plan issues of

fertility, then it's very difficult to work out.

Okay.

Any thoughts on this, general?

Somehow the audience, they, um, try to make it related

and unidimensional so that it's easier for them to compete

on this instead of.

Because sometimes when you hear the debate, it's not it's

not presented as something that is complex, right?

It's simplified.

It's a question of us versus them.

In the case of migrants, for instance, when it's a

more complex question because the economy like there's obviously what

people want culturally, but then the economic consequences and impact

and everything.

And to me it feels that maybe sometimes parties, they

kind of gain in a way by simplifying the access

and.

Then it makes the competition easier for them.

I agree in, in general the, the the gain by

simplifying the, the state space on this, but sometimes it's

presented as a fully economic thing because maybe they don't

want to get to the cultural stuff, and sometimes it's

actually presented with purely cultural stuff, and sometimes it's just,

I mean, what.

Yeah, what is the US?

And they do typically Say something about this and it's

interesting to understand, I think how they do it.

So are they sort of mixing these two together as

in, as in them keeping it very vague or are

they, you know, focusing on the cultural stuff?

Because let's assume that there is no issue of fake

news or wrong data.

Let's assume that, uh, that, for example, on economic, uh,

grounds, you know, maybe good to have a diverse society

and then maybe.

Even.

The parties are aware of this, then at least one

of the party would want to focus on the culture.

And so it's I think it's super interesting to understand

both the preference, you know, how the real preferences of

individuals inform and can can play.

Uh.

Yeah.

And also the, the grouping itself.

So who is us?

Uh.

I think that's very interesting.

Right.

Because often say, for instance, in feminism, there's often the

accusation that, you know, all you have all these women

grouping together to try and extract some physical redistribution towards

women, but then that mostly goes towards like white women

and like, we may be.

Sure like.

You know, the gains aren't being shared fairly.

Yeah.

So that's yeah, that's not as important as identity formation.

But at the same time, yeah, you have to.

And then you will say, you know, we do see

that black women's incomes have also risen following feminism or

as part of feminism.

But black men's um, incomes have risen at the same

time.

So there's like all these like different alliances as before.

So for example, I mean, there is a lot of

data, you know.

Showing that women are consistently starting to.

So there it used to be the case that women

were more conservative than men in the 50s in the

US.

Uh, but then women started voting more to the left.

And, you know, potentially in response to the reason why

women have left home and started.

Which is.

And of course, then so then the other question is,

of course, the big issue.

This is how how we separate the groups in terms

of data, that data to look at and how people

separate themselves.

Again, observable features are very important.

But we don't separate, you know, tormentors, short men or

women or whatever.

Were separate according to some other feature also.

Quite.

Um.

I'm guessing points out that there's this cleavage between the

Brahmin left.

You're like the people who have got to university.

Yeah, and the merchant.

Right.

Who have.

Yes.

You have like maybe on as well educated, but often

very wealthy.

Then you can also split that equally among.

Like for instance, 66% of graduates now are women.

And so maybe it's actually less about like the Brahmin

left a much right and sort of going left and

right instead.

Yeah, yeah.

Depends a little bit.

But it depends on what the data.

But we also collect, you know, we decide also what

dummies put in the regression.

So it's so And so then there is more emphasis,

I mean, of course, on observable stuff, but on particular

observables.

And we think that this is done.

I mean, in many regressions people put for example, gender

because it's there in the data.

But, you know, sometimes I'm asking what was your hypothesis?

Gender would matter, have no input.

And then sometimes the problem is that, you know, if

you get no significance, you don't even report to.

The regression.

So only stuff that is significant is reported.

And also typically in the direction of the stereotype that

we have.

So I think yeah.

Uh.

It's a real challenge to understand, uh, especially in the

context of sort of.

Today's, uh, you know, populism.

Uh.

So the political scientist is typically explained by backlash against

the sort of progressive ideas.

And, uh, but I think the culture and the economics

are related.

It has to be more than one dimension.

And about how these dimensions are put together, which is

which is tricky.

Okay.

So let me show you what we have currently.

Uh.

In all these papers, there would always be problems because

a lot of these issues.

But that's what we have.

The first paper is by emotion is the he's actually

often visiting here King so he's in London.

If any of you want to talk to him.

So it really works on worked on identity for many

years.

So it's very it's a very interesting thing.

Okay.

So here.

Is as I've alluded to.

You're going to choose your identity.

Okay.

The social group that you, you will feel closer to.

And we're going to look at two dimensions.

And you could identify with your class or you could

identify with your nation.

These are the others.

The others are not model okay.

And your nation is going to sort of essentially we're

going to think about everyone.

So you either feel pride in the whole society, or

you either feel pride in being part of your own

income.

Okay.

So the first element is a standard material payoff, uh,

by it.

So t is the level of taxes, as you can

see.

And.

Why is your income there going to be just two

levels of income?

One for the poor, one for the rich, and you're

going to enjoy your disposable income, plus the general redistribution

that, as you can see, suffers from some inefficiency given

the excess.

So in this economy, there are no efficiency benefits for

taxation okay.

You can think about public goods like education and all

of this only only losses.

Okay.

So without any other social construct we have the melting.

Richard.

The results, the very basic result.

So the preferences of taxation are going to increase in

your income if your income is higher than that of

the poor.

So if you're rich, you're going to have positive.

Sorry if you're.

Yeah.

If you're the.

If what you're getting okay from redistribution is higher than

your poor your own income.

You want taxation.

If you're rich what you're getting back is less than

your own income.

Uh, and his assumption, which is the standard assumption that

we take, is that the poor are the larger groups.

So the median voter is a poor individual.

So if we just have this class conflict in society,

then that's going to be the level of, uh, taxation.

Okay.

So we just take a derivative with respect to T

and this is what you get.

Okay.

So to decide which group I'm going to belong to,

I am, which will be determined in equilibrium together with

taxes.

So I'm going to look at two things.

I like to be in a group whose status is

high okay.

And the other element is that I'm likely to be

in a group in which I'm quite similar to the

victim.

Okay.

That's nice.

So both of them together.

So the best thing would be to be in a

group in which everyone was like me and that we

have high stuff.

So what is the status of a group?

The status given some tax level.

Okay.

The status of group J is going to be there

is some exogenous element which we can ignore.

And it's not that okay.

Okay.

And The second element is the income of group J

minus the income of.

The rest of them.

So for example.

So this.

You can think about this.

The status of a group is relative to another group.

This part.

So it depends on how we define the population.

So if you think about the class division then the

income of the there is a particular income for the

rich group, that particular income for the poor group.

And that will just be the difference between the two

okay.

If you group according to nationality.

So we're just going to to ignore the income of

the rest of the world.

Okay.

And we're just going to think about the average income.

Okay.

So this is status and.

It will be important that it's a relative concept here.

Uh okay.

Okay.

The next element is the distance.

Okay.

So I didn't write the the particular expression there in

the paper.

It's a bit too difficult to maintain.

So there are you could you but essentially think about

the distance as my wage by my time relative to

the average point in the.

Okay.

So everything is on income.

There is no other dimension.

Everything here is on me.

Okay.

So if I belong to the.

So the core group.

Okay.

All the four here would have the same income.

Okay.

So we have a zero as your distance.

But if I think about the nation okay I there

is there.

Then my distance from this group is depends on taxation.

Right.

The distance from the if I pull the distance from

the core group does not depend because all of them

will have the same income.

But if I think of the distance between me and

the rest of the nation, then it will depend on

the level of taxation.

Okay.

So this is the utility from identifying with group J.

The first element does not depend on the group.

It's just my income.

The second element is the loss that I have with

distance.

So d I, j is the distance of individual I

from group j.

And then I have the boost of the status.

The status is.

Okay.

And then in equilibrium two things are determined simultaneously.

Let's assume, for example that we've identified with our.

Let's just focus.

So in the paper they really focuses mostly on the

poor group which are the median filter.

Okay.

Uh so let's just do the consideration for the program.

Let's say we've identified as a class okay as the

income class.

Okay.

Maybe the rich identify with the nation.

I don't care at this point because I'm looking at

the median voter.

And I think how the median voter.

Okay.

So that's the poor.

So if the poor, let's say the poor, identify in

the class the income class.

Okay.

They have a particular utility function.

That is a function of the their identity.

And their income.

And the utility from identity is also affected by by

the tax.

Okay.

So now what they do is to choose a tax

level that maximises this utility okay.

Okay, so I started with assumption on identity.

So the identify with class that led me to an

optimal decision okay.

And now what I need is that given this taxation

I'm happy with my chosen identity okay.

So it has to be a fixed point a fixed

point argument.

How are you measuring being happy with this particular identity?

With this tax level, you get higher utility for identifying

with this group.

So now I'm just comparing the identity being in this

group, the utility from being in this group compared to

the utility.

So if you can think about this somehow, I'm another

way to think about it somehow and magically receiving this

equilibrium tax rate.

Given this tax rate, I'm asking myself, who do I

want to identify with?

Given that I identify with this particular group, I'm happy.

So you can see that there could be multiple equilibrium

here.

Right.

Because because it could be okay.

It could be that if I identify with the nation,

I choose a particular tax rate that would actually make

me identify, happy to identify.

It's like I'm playing as the median.

I'm playing sort of a personal equilibrium with myself.

I'm making two choices, but I'm not asking.

I'm not sort of choosing them both together, choosing them

as supporting each other.

That creates.

Okay, lots of stuff on this slide, but, uh, so

just to understand the machinery of what's going on here

or the intuitions or the intuition for what?

So again, if I look at an equilibrium in which

there is class identification.

So if I start from this identification there is class

identification.

Uh.

The distance is not a problem for the pool, right?

For any for any level of success.

The distance is going to be zero given this.

Okay.

But as compared to the environment in which we didn't

have social identity.

Now, what do I have?

I have this status thing.

Okay.

What does this status make me do?

Essentially it makes me put more utility on the on

the gap in, in, uh, so I'm putting more weight

on the average utility of the poor compared to the

rich.

Right.

Okay.

So if without social identity, I'm just looking to maximise

my, my time, my income now I'm just I'm looking

to maximise my income.

Plus I think it was gamma times average income of

the poor by averaging.

Okay.

So I have more incentive to reduce the difference between

the rich.

So the tax level that I would ask or that

I would demand with this identity equilibrium is higher than

what I'm asking.

Okay.

So class identity gives us, uh, an increase in taxation

compared to the standard.

Tax method.

So we have more.

More equality here.

Okay.

So before closing the loop on that, let's just contrast

this with the case in which I identify with the

nation as a whole.

Identifying with the nation as a whole.

Actually, I'm putting weight on the utility of the rich

on the income.

Okay.

Which makes me internalise the inefficiency of taxation.

Again, there is no benefit for taxation of efficiency.

There is no long term possibilities for growth or okay,

so only in efficiency.

If I look at the the average utility in society.

There is no reason to for taxation.

If I care about the average utility of society, identifying

with the nation implies that I will ask for blessings.

So if we want to explain why there is maybe

less redistribution compared to what we think is better, in

which we are looking to see if there exists such

As again.

Then we identify as a particular nation against the rest

of the world.

Right.

Okay.

So how do we find now?

How do we sort of close the loop and go

back from.

So we said, okay, if I identify with this, that

would be my taxation level.

One way to think about this is to go to

the extremes.

Okay.

Remember we also had some exogenous parameters that determine the

status.

So status was sigma zero plus sigma one times the

difference to the other group okay.

So for example if these exogenous parameters so the extreme

let's say the very high for one group and low.

So they are very high for the nation okay.

So if somehow you know I managed to create an

environment in which there is high status for my nation

compared to the basic status of the people, okay, then

I would have an incentive to identify the nation.

Okay.

And to ask for low taxes.

Okay.

Which increases here.

Right.

The endogenous part of status because it increases the average,

it increases the average wage.

Okay.

For example, the status of the nation was something like

this.

You can look at it without exception, at the status.

I think that's what it was actually in the paper.

You can look at it at the level of taxation

of this standard model without identity.

But let's think about this actually accession and the status

of the poor, some basic status for the poor.

And then look at this.

Okay.

So assuming that I identify with the nation.

Okay I go for low tax.

Okay.

Go for Lucas.

Let's think of zero tax just for looking at the

equations.

Okay.

To write a simple expression.

What do I get in my utility function?

I get my income, the basic income.

Then I have the there was a parameter beta multiplying

the distance from, uh, the groups that identify with.

Now that I identify with the nations, there is a

positive distance.

Right.

So it's the distance is my own income minus the

average income.

Okay.

So it's a function of alpha and the original inequality.

But I also get the status of the group.

I think there was a gamma parameter.

There.

And the status of the group depends positively on.

What may just right as an asset here depends positively

on the average okay.

Here it depends negatively on the average.

It depends positive.

And so the beta and the gamma parameters of of

course also okay.

So this has to be higher than okay.

This element is not important I always get that right.

So it has to be with the taxes.

And here I assume sort of no taxes.

Okay.

So I assume we get low taxes.

So I thought about zero taxes.

Now if I get taxation I have a higher income

I have no difference.

So if given this.

So I'm assuming that the taxes are still Zero.

And so this is the same again.

Now I'm thinking, what if I identify with the poor?

I get the same income.

I have zero distance from the pool.

Okay.

But what I get is.

The status of the.

Okay.

Okay, so if s n minus s p okay.

Which relates to both these exogenous parameters.

But also how large is the difference between the rich

and the poor.

See, for example here.

If the poor are very if the rich are very

small.

Okay.

Uh, their level of income is going to loom large

here and really reduced the status of the poor.

Okay.

But it's not going to play a big role.

Okay.

So if, uh, s n is larger than SPE compared

to what?

Compared to better over here.

Right here I have the better gamma.

So if my distance to the group is very important

for me, okay, I will not identify the nation, but

it's not too important compared to the difference.

And.

Then I'm happy to identify with the nation.

On the other hand, if this is not too large.

Okay, this is not too large.

It's not.

So let's assume that now I am identifying with my

class.

Okay.

So now I will get at the high tax level.

So I'm going to choose a high point.

So this is going to increase okay.

My.

Again, identifying with the nation instead is going to give

me some negative distance here.

Okay.

And that's not going to be as high because again,

now I'm having high taxation on reducing the average income.

Okay.

What we need is this to be lower than identifying

with my class okay.

But again under always under the same taxation checking whether

I want to be in this equilibrium.

So this element is not going to play a role.

It's only going to be as an SP.

Again this is going to be zero.

Okay.

So uh, I've increased the status of the poor with

this taxation okay.

So that reinforces my decision.

So I can try.

Okay, so what did we do here?

We changed the preferences of individual okay.

That's really the first case.

The second assumption is we determined.

So we have just one dimension of difference between the

two.

But we created the two dimensions on which we are

two ways in which we can change our preferences.

One is, you know, to focus on essentially to put

more weighting function, uh, on the income of the phone.

The other way is to put more weight in the

utility function on the average incomes.

Okay.

So if I care about some of the caring about

the nation status of the nation means that I.

That I care about the average income.

Caring about the poor in this way.

It's like putting some way on the utility of my

people like me compared to to other people here.

And then there is the issue of the distance.

Okay.

Sort of balances this.

Right.

Because with the poor, yes.

Typically they will have a lower status because that's going

to be negative.

But I feel more at home when I think, okay,

so we change the preferences by creating these two possible

dimensions on which you can, uh, you can identify.

So sort of what are the salient dimensions?

These are going to be the dimensions that potentially will

allow me to make this choice at all.

Uh.

And that's And that that is going to affect our

decision.

So here the decision is only about going to affect

the decision.

So here I'm choosing my identity.

I am uh my identity means that I put.

So these two things that I essentially I put more

weight on the.

Sort of relative utility of this group.

The group that I identify with.

Okay.

But there is also the distance issue.

But even without the distance okay.

Just the idea that the tax itself, of course, if

I, if I identify with the whole nation according to

the economic environment assumption, I want lower taxes.

If I identify with the poor, I won't hide.

So that's how it influences success and the distance influences

which of the distance influences actually whether this is an

equilibrium or not, that I identify with the notion.

So of course interesting.

So it's important for us to know what are the

possible dimensions on which we can shop society, uh, that

individuals can potentially identify with how these dimensions come about.

Uh.

So this, this type of, uh, uh, thinking or trying

to explain why the poor, essentially the poor, are the

actors here.

Why don't the poor demand the right tax level for

their economic interests?

Essentially says they also care about another dimension.

Dimension?

They care about their identity.

Dimension.

Okay.

And somehow the they are made to care about the

the sort of, uh, economic efficiency or also the welfare

of everyone in society.

Also, the rich here, essentially they care about the rich

because they we get this, uh, mentality of us versus

them or there is some it's there is something else

that they care about, uh, that makes them demand lower

taxation.

So it sort of it has a little bit of

the flavour of, uh, Marxian opium for the masses type

of Explanation that you make the poor care about something

else that reduces the demand.

It's not obvious why.

Are other dimensions and make them care about them.

Yes.

Exception.

So we saw in the parties model, we saw that,

you know, if there have some other interests, they are

willing to, uh, reduce taxation as long as they get

particular distribution for that.

Here we see that just the other dimension is constructed

in a way that you want, you care about.

Okay?

So you care about the glory of your your societies

being successful, uh, economically.

It still feels like a inequality of preferences from equality

preferences.

I mean, that's another way to.

Look at these exogenous parameters that define the.

Yeah.

How much.

You.

The welfare of everyone or the welfare of the poor.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Did you buy that?

Tim has the status as like, you get status from

being in a group or that's fine with the group.

That's very small.

So the larger the group is less than that.

I mean, to a degree, this this this is also

part of this, right?

I mean, when the group is, is smaller, essentially it's

going to be composed of people that are more like

you and the larger group you have, uh.

That has more punishment for being different from the other

members of your group.

Right?

Well, it is.

You know, you are different than the average.

You're punished.

I.

See?

There is a large literature on status, uh, you know,

the literature that talks about conspicuous consumption.

Uh.

So I care not only about my absolute income.

I also care about my relative income.

So this is I care about my relative income.

And this is somehow, you know, I care about.

I'm just, uh, altruistic.

So I care about my group and the other group

with another way to.

Think about this.

And because here it's more because, you know, it's quite

the basic water.

So it's only the pool that are the collector.

So it's only the so only for the poor altruistic.

Uh, the rich don't have to be.

Modelling or integrating this status.

How can we integrate as well?

Stigma associated with certain studies.

Right.

So the next model that we're going to talk about,

we're going to have these identities affecting your beliefs about

the people there.

Okay.

Again I don't think it's a perfect way to do

it the way they do it, but it's what we

currently have.

Uh, so essentially.

I think the stigma element is important in the sense

of thinking about also identity.

Identity imposed on you.

Okay.

So, um, it's what people, other people think about your

identity.

So thank you for that.

So more generally, I think with the.

With these issues, you know, computing status and everything, also

more generally computing what I think should be the text

level, actual beliefs about the income distribution and my place

in the income distribution when we think about status are

very important.

And typically people don't get right at all the place

in the income distribution.

So everyone thinks that the are roughly the the median

or the mean.

Mostly because people interact with people that are more similar

to them.

Uh.

A lot of people sort of look up rather than

look down.

So that would create an effect in which you think

you are poorer than other people.

Right.

So you don't, you know, you don't gain as much

happiness from seeing that you have.

You're better off compared to other people.

You gain more unhappiness.

When.

You see how worse off you are.

So it's sort of, uh, maybe a reference points that

explanation.

Um.

So I think that's a, that's, that's a big behavioural

bias is just understanding Ending the income distribution and your

place in the distribution.

So I think like the median income in the UK.

£27,000.

Yeah.

Most people think that they're very close to the median.

Right.

Yeah.

Okay.

So so yeah.

So so and when you try you know, so.

When you compute the basic tax level that you want

or when you add to this all this computation of

status and stigma and all this type of stuff, The

more biases you're going to have, potentially it's going to

exacerbate the problem.

Or maybe a mineral.

Okay.

So the next model we're actually going to think about

this identity stuff affecting.

It's also why we just form.

It will affect your utility but it's going to affect

your beliefs uh about your expected income.

Okay.

So rather than introduce a belief channel or splitting people

into groups, essentially that's the key thing.

The key assumption is how we speak.

So we've got to think of preferences in this way

by thinking about these.

Okay, so maybe it's time for a break.

Okay.

20 minutes.

Zero.

So.

This.

Is.

But.

I don't want that.

Okay.

Thank you.

Sir.

Hi.

Oh.

Morning.

Yes.

Coffee?

Coffee.

How's that?

Um, we finally had the budget come through.

And I was wondering whether you have any space available,

uh, next week for hosting, like 30, 40 people?

Um, either Wednesday, Thursday or Friday?

Yeah.

Promote was 40.

Something available on Wednesday.

Okay.

No, it wouldn't be a sit down.

It'd be more like drinks.

And maybe we'd get some food just to share.

Yeah.

We put some money behind the bar.

Probably about a thousand.

Yeah.

Uh, 1100.

That whole thing.

And then.

But then, you know, with people buying drinks as well.

Uh.

Uh, I know x, um, and I need to speak

to.

I need to be the rest of the committee, but.

I'll call you back.

Okay.

Yeah.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

So the canapé menu is 25 ahead.

And we can sort of choose how many people to

order that fall.

Okay, great.

Okay, great.

Okay I need to I'll check in with what the

others think and then I'll give you a call later.

All right.

Cheers.

Thank you.

Okay, so the second paper is based on paper by

the newly confirmed Julian Schleifer.

And this is a this sort of more theoretical paper

is exactly related to what Laura asked about stigma.

Um, the idea is as follows.

You split the population in some way.

Okay?

We all know that if we split the population in

two, it's narrow.

The distribution is never going to be the same.

Right?

Okay.

So let's say income between two groups okay.

And there is a difference.

But the difference might be very small okay.

What in general people observe okay.

So for example Yeah.

Thank you for an example.

But if I remember, is that, uh.

We all know that there are old people in Florida

because it's sort of a good place for retirement.

It's just hot, warm.

We don't need to trade off weather for work place.

Okay.

So there are old people in Florida.

It's a good place for retirement.

But, you know, there are also young people in Florida.

Uh, and what is the fact that there are old

people in Florida?

Does that mean that all the Florida population.

Oh, no.

Okay.

The fact that this is salient, uh, there could be

very small differences between the demography distribution or the other,

uh, state laws that we give them the data on

this.

But this small difference in people's views would be very

salient and their beliefs could be exacerbated.

So a small difference in the distribution.

Maybe this is income between women or whatever two groups

you're looking at.

Again, the arbitrariness of which two groups to look at

is important.

This in people's mind, these differences are exacerbated and sort

of detect the characteristic of the average here compared to

the characteristic.

The average here writing in just in terms of the,

uh, the trend.

Okay.

So this one is higher than this one.

And they just magnify, magnify.

And that's a way for them.

The paper's called the stereotypes.

That's a way for them to think about stereotypes.

So stereotype is essentially take small immaterial difference and magnify

it in a way to that essentially affect your beliefs

that you think about everyone in this population, you know,

having much higher income.

And they give a lot of, uh, psychological underpinning for

this type of exacerbation.

Um.

Okay.

So when we think about essentially magnifying differences, okay, rather

than focusing on similarity, when we and there could be

ways in which we divide the population in which we

magnify the differences.

And I guess there could be ways in which we

divide the population and we don't magnify so well how

such stereotypes are created.

That's a different story.

It would be endogenous, but assuming you know which people

tend to do this, we can just take this evening.

And so.

Okay.

So now they put this.

So not all the questions.

So uh, generally now in the paper on political economy

and.

to begin it, um.

Put this into, I think, sort of influenced by, put

this into a model of identity.

Okay.

So identity now is going to affect your beliefs about

the group.

Okay.

The group you belong to.

And the idea is that if you identify with a

particular group, you all the way the trait that is

relatively more frequent in this group compared to the other

group.

So for example, which is what we're going to have

if you're not sure about your income, your income is

subject to shocks.

So you have some distribution in mind of the income

of the poor.

Okay.

You belong.

You know you belong to the poor.

If you actually identify with the poor, okay, you will

perceive the distribution of income as lower than it really

is in reality, because you will perceive it according to

the difference between the poor and H.

So you put more weight on this difference.

Remember that what we did in the first hour, what

we did is to say, okay, if you're poor and

you identify with the poor, there is another element to

your preferences.

And essentially you put some weight on the difference in

income between poor and orange.

Okay.

And all the all the income groups were the same.

Now, what you're going to do is assess your income

as lower than the troika, okay?

When you identify with the poor.

So and the larger is this difference, the lower you

think that your income.

But the original difference is going to play a role

because that's what's going to exacerbate, you know, you're putting

more weight on this original difference as really the important

thing in your in your an experiment before the thing

is thinking about the actual distribution.

So one way to think about this is that, you

know, I take this is the distribution of income of

the poor, and I shift it this direction according to

this difference.

Okay.

So technically it creates a very similar effect.

Okay.

So one effect comes from this.

You know group price or loss of price when we

have a difference.

The other effect comes from me trying to think what's

going to be my income.

And when I think what's going to be my income,

I think it's subject to shocks because it's going to

be drawn from this distribution.

I put more weight on the difference and I shift

this distribution as a function.

Right.

So I create a bigger difference okay.

So it's a bit like putting weight on putting away

because there is more that will happen here okay.

But so it's a whole story about beliefs.

Uh, there is more that will happen.

But technically there are a lot of similarities.

So if you're going to empirically test these models, I

mean, we can go back to our model.

We fit preferences.

It's going to be if you just check tax level

or things like that, it will be very difficult to

distinguish these two types of models.

Uh.

So you will really have to test the mechanism itself.

At least it.

Also believes in this model would go a little bit

in the opposite direction that what I described before before

I described it typically empirically we see these people think

they're more than closer to the median.

So here the poor thing that they are poorer than

they really are.

And the rich.

Okay.

So it's not ideal.

Uh, very good to think about this.

So people think there is a bigger difference here between

their own income.

There is there is some element of that in reality.

Again, if you think about future income and you think

about the possibilities for social mobility.

People think there is more social mobility than there is

typically.

Uh, and if you think about other traits rather than

income, uh.

People clearly all across the board think that they are

more polarised in their beliefs compared to what truly their

beliefs are.

So you ask people about their preferences on many dimensions.

They are not as polarised as they think they are

compared to.

anything.

Okay.

So so this will capture this income.

But on other stuff like you.

Know some control stuff.

It's on.

It's going to people think there is much greater.

Again because maybe of some strategic salience that is created

by competition.

Okay.

Okay.

So.

Again let me just present the basic, uh, environment without

looking into beliefs at all.

So your utility, this is a sort of you can

think about this as, uh.

We will think about this later is the averages.

But, you know, utility as a function of your income.

So epsilon here is the shock to your income.

You can take have in mind a normal distribution around

zero.

Okay, so this is going to be a shock to

your income.

So your income is going to be one plus Epsilon

Tao is the level of taxes.

Taxes again are distortion free.

So that's minus five over 2000 squared.

But tax is also give you this public good okay.

So.

And then we have a second dimension okay.

So before we just add one dimension of decision now

we have a second dimension.

So before the second dimension was just for the purpose

of identification here the second dimension is supposed to be

a two dimension.

Uh, some sort of a cultural dimension of how progressive

we should be or How pro-immigration we should be.

So something on the line.

Okay, so this is the sort of the element of

the preferences.

And you have an ideal policy model.

So it's a quadratic loss function.

Uh kappa measures how much you care about this dimension

compared to your income.

And so without any distortion in this economy, uh, your.

Your, uh, desired tax level, okay, is a function of

how much you get from the utility from the public

good compared to your income.

And of course, taking into consideration the distortion from taxation

and your ideal level of progressiveness, let's say, is just

this ideal political website.

Okay.

Okay, so if you think about the utility of the

average agent, if PSI goes from -1 to 1, for

example.

So zero would be the level of progressiveness that the

average agent would choose.

And epsilon also distributed normally with zero mean.

So that's going to be the text level.

Okay.

So so far nothing uh nothing special in this model.

But we introduce the second dimension.

In general, the political model in this environment before it

was the median total.

Now it's going to be maximising the utility of the

average.

Okay.

Because if we are in a probabilistic voting model, these

parties that try to win the competition, then that's what

that's going to be.

The outcome of something great maximises the utility of that.

So but from the we don't have a lot in

these models.

We don't have a lot about political institutions.

So the I would say talk to put a lot

of things in a model.

Right.

So if you introduce more stuff in the economic environment

or the psychological environment, then typically people tend to simplify

a lot the electorate.

And why not the media like.

The.

Media?

Well, yeah, I mean, it's a good question.

I mean I guess the, the so the best answer.

But if you have more than one dimension of policy

okay, then you know what media and why would we

have a media management.

Institution.

Maybe that this.

So if you use probabilistic voting That.

Was.

On many dimensions.

It would give you the average.

Of.

The voting, meaning that people vote according to their preferences.

But also we have shocks.

Okay.

And then sort of somehow that because of the shocks,

that allows us to think about the averages.

And in this case, if you.

If parties want to maximise the number of votes that

they have.

And what it would call like the Condorcet winner and

that that would fall on if there is a.

Winner.

Yes, yes, yes.

But we have a multidimensional continuum, this continuous distribution of

people here because of their expectations about the so so

the.

The cultural dimension is going to be more general.

It's going to be a continuum, okay.

The economic dimension is just going to be two groups

and their beliefs.

And also speak to.

So in many models that have a multi dimensional stuff,

what they do sometimes is just the sequential median broker.

Okay, so you first vote on one thing and then

you vote on the other.

And that will give you a medium in any of

these.

If voters are not strategic and don't see the correlation

between them.

There is no correlation here.

But you know what would be in the in the

topic that we're looking at.

It would be interesting to think of how the political

scientist and politician, instead of the politicians, affect these dimensions

that we're focusing on.

That is.

uh.

Rather than maybe the details of the electoral system.

But what politicians can do in particular divisions rather than.

Okay.

Okay.

So in most of the papers.

So what they do is fix, as we did before

with the nation nation with the others.

So on the cultural space we pick some division point

okay.

Maybe zero.

Everyone here is going to be called socially progressive okay.

And everyone here is going to be called socially conservative.

And the division into groups is according to this.

Okay.

So it's a fixed division.

Okay.

Actually yeah.

So there are differences also on uh also epsilon is.

The way to model the sort of the poor and

the rich.

Sorry is that people have deep beliefs about their epsilon

okay.

So epsilon can actually range okay.

People have beliefs about their epsilon.

And again you know, everyone above some epsilon hat.

Okay.

Uh.

Could be perceived as rich.

Everyone about here.

The key thing is that you look at the average.

The average in this group.

Sort of a bit similar to what we did before.

You look at the average of this group.

So let's call it epsilon hat with rich epsilon hat

for the poor okay.

The larger is this division is going to be.

So according to this.

According to this I denoted by.

People will look at this difference and will exacerbate the

beliefs about themselves according to this because they shift essentially.

So if you just look at this and you apply

the stereotype model that we briefly Discussed.

You take here the average in this group and the

average in this group.

Okay.

If you identify as a social conservative, that's the identity

that you choose.

Then you think that the conflict in society is much

bigger.

Okay.

It's much bigger.

Take this average.

And you think that the conflict in society is much

bigger than it truly is, and you're just more polarised

because you think that what they want, what this other

group wants is much more to the right.

Okay.

So you really care more about finding your ground compared

to not having this time.

Okay.

And here, as we said, I'm thinking that, you know,

in because I don't know exactly what my income is

going to be, I think that my income is going

to be lower than it is the rich think during

the larger than it is.

amazing.

In general, each group looking at the other things, that

there is great implementation.

Okay, so so far I only defined the type of

groups that we can.

Then we can, uh, identify with either the cultural dimension

or the or the economic dimension.

You can identify with one of these two groups that

we fixed.

And here is an assumption.

Okay.

This is a bit different than before.

So before we had the assumption that you look at

the distance to your group and the status of the

group.

Now it's a different assumption.

The assumption here is that you look at the conflict

and you identify on along the dimension that maximises the

conflict, okay.

So that has a feature of some salience.

Right.

So if we look at, you know, if parties are

most responsive to the largest conflict in society or newspapers.

News media outlets are responsive to the largest conflict.

Somehow everyone is going to focus on that and maybe

identify a goal, or even if identity is somehow imposed

on you, you know, if people are going to have

this most salient conflict in mind, they're going to see

you on the on this particular dimension, but.

On another language.

So generally you look at the.

So remember the utility function for a member of group

G given.

The ideal think about the average person in this group.

Think about their ideal targets and their ideal, uh, progressive

level okay.

So let's measure the conflict according to the average person

sitting in the group.

Okay.

I don't need to measure.

I mean, I guess it's probably going to be quite

robust to that, that each member compares their own ideal

policy to the average of the other group.

We look at just the averages of the group.

So I look at the average indirect utility.

Remember in my group okay.

Minus the average utility of this member, if we use

the indirect the ideal policies of the average member in

the Adam.

So it's a bit like how much I want my

group to win compared to the other.

Looking from the point of view of the average.

I remember that the key thing here is that who

I think is the average member of my group is

going to be distorted already by the difference in discourse.

Okay.

So whatever dimension I'm going to focus on.

I'm going to distort.

So there's the assumption similar to what we did before

is that if I identify with the group, that's the

dimension I'm distorting on in terms of my beliefs okay.

The identity, it's not I'm not distorting in general.

Identity is going to distort because once it becomes its

identity is going to distort the differences.

Okay.

Thank you.

So what is the conflict, uh, between the rich and

the poor?

So I don't remember why they call it u and

l, I mean.

h and L would make sense.

So you would differ up and down.

But here we have you and time.

Uh, so essentially the conflict is going to be according

to the tax rate, right.

The tax rate that the people want would be higher

than what we've seen in the basic environment.

The tax rate that the richer people want will be.

The average of the rich will be lower.

But essentially the everything right.

To remember it was the value of the public good,

which was the same for everyone minus your expected income.

Okay.

So now the expected income is going to be, uh,

the difference between them is going to be stretched according

to the average incomes.

And that's going to be the conflict between the rich

and the poor.

Okay.

And if the conflict is focussed on the social groups,

again, it's going to be the difference in their ideal

policies.

Okay.

And copper was the common thread.

And.

The main problem problematic in all these models is that

there is a lot of notation, a lot of Greek

letters.

Uh.

In the paper, what they have, they have a distribution

of people along.

Their.

Epsilon and alongside.

And they assume so the limit case is that they

are independent, but they look at the cases in which

there is positive correlation in the following sense that the

richer you are, the more progressive one.

Okay.

I They don't need it, technically.

Uh, they have some empirical justification for it.

I'm not, you know, I don't know, uh.

But it allows them to get more empirical prediction.

If it's true that there is more positive correlation then

such and such.

Okay, but we can focus on the case of independence.

There is no need to assume this correlation to get

the basic result.

It goes with correlation.

Then you have parameter of correlation also.

So I've abstracted away from this.

Uh yeah.

Where are they getting that evidence that people overestimate differences.

Like I don't know the.

Series that from the original paper they did a series

of.

Experiments.

Um, and I think there is evidence that I think

that the conflict is larger than it really is on

many cultural issues.

Okay.

Uh, yeah.

I think that's part of the polarisation literature is saying

that, right?

I mean, looking at effective polarisation of essentially saying if

the Democrats come to power, they're going to kill us

all around.

Uh, so I think that, uh, people assess the other

side to be worse on, on, uh, on individuals.

So, for example, when it's salient, people totally overestimate the

number of, uh, immigrants in the country.

Okay.

So, as I mentioned, becomes salient and thinks that the

country is totally overrun.

By this.

Migration.

Um.

I guess I wasn't thinking about what you said in

the first slide, which is like people surrounded by people

who are like them.

So yeah, at the same time as a resume and

how different they are from the other groups, they may

be underestimated.

The prevalence of those groups as well.

Right.

And there's a classic example in the UK where, like

most people in this country support spiking children.

But if you ask people in this room, presumably this

would be against that.

So no one would ever assume that, like, I would

never assume that the country would be in favour.

So that doesn't underestimate how different people are.

So you're saying most of the country will support?

I see.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Which I think is against my intuition.

Yeah.

So.

I guess it's not very safe in nature.

So I can see that on salient issue, people think,

you know, once they think it's a problem, okay.

If people are saying it's a problem, has to be

there is a large number of problems.

Uh.

But I do say that, uh.

Stereotypes.

If you think about stereotypes, I do see that.

Uh, so it may not be the exactly the right

application of this idea, but, um, if you get used

to thinking about people according to some particular division, I

think differences are more exacerbated.

And you tend to think about the differences because once

you see, uh, I think once you have an idea

of a difference in mind and you see the evidence

in its favour, then you're saying, okay, of course it

is okay if you and then you pay less attention

to similarities.

I see this, uh, you know, if you think about

when people think about the differences between small boys and

small girls, small boys and girls, if they see a

boy running around, they say, oh, of course, if they

see the girl running around, they don't.

It just doesn't register.

Okay.

So I think there is the the way we think

about stereotypes.

I think there is some justification for this idea that

maybe it's not the obvious application.

Okay, so what are we going to get in this

model?

Is that.

Whoever you choose to identify with of that dimension, you're

going to exacerbate exacerbated okay.

If you exacerbate the differences on income, that means that

the poor, uh, would want higher taxation.

As I said before, if you exacerbate the difference on

on progressiveness, then essentially, um, you think there is a

greater conflict.

Okay.

So what does that do?

Okay.

So if we identify on the income dimension.

So whatever group I identify with okay.

The epsilon that I think I will have is sort

of the original epsilon that we started with.

Plus the bias because I think my distribution is shifting

okay.

So if I identify with this group I put more

weight on these differences.

And hence my distribution of shocks is shifting.

So I think I'm going to be either richer than

I am or poorer than okay.

If I identify with the progressive, uh, or the conservative

in terms of culture.

Again, I think that my essay is going to shift

either in the more progressive direction or in the more

conservative direction.

So this I find less a bit less convincing.

So on income, I can see this idea of shocks

in general.

Our incomes, a lot of incomes are not very clear.

Right.

Because there is so much that enters into income and

taxation and so on.

So maybe people don't, you know, they just estimate their

income, right?

Um.

Oh, gotcha.

I mean.

Uh.

Yeah.

Maybe also, when I'm forming my beliefs, I somehow becoming

more agitated when I talk to other people and I

move in some direction.

Okay, so then you're own individual ideal policies, depending on

who you identify with.

Uh, I'm going to move in this direction.

So if you have a positive difference in your estimated

shocks of the averages of this division, then you're going

to require a lower tax rate.

And the other way round and the same for policies.

Okay.

So you see on the income dimension it's a bit

it's it's quite similar to what we had before.

Okay.

So we went through all this relief process.

But it's just the second dimension here is modelled differently.

Completely orthogonal to income could be potentially related but not

to income.

But the first dimension.

We went through all these beliefs.

It gave us a similar feature to what we had

before in terms of what happened on the right before

Essentially you care about, you know, the shock of your

group compared to the shock of the other.

Okay.

So that's very similar to Shire shares paper coming from

coming from preferences.

Are yes Ellen H were lower class and upper class.

Yes.

Okay.

Okay.

So.

If there is no bias.

So the effect of identity variables, if there is no

bias in your beliefs, it doesn't matter if you identify

with a group or not.

Right.

Ideal policies are not affected.

We get the same observation.

Get without all this story.

Okay.

If, on the other hand, data is positive, then ideal

policies are going to be affected.

And now we can look at the different types of,

uh, identification.

Again, they allow people in the main model to just

identify either risk or which always potentially there could be

four different groups here.

Right.

What do you think about this?

Uh, in the main paper, main part of the paper,

they think just about these two groups.

So now employ the political model and the political model.

You maximise the utility of the average voter.

Okay.

Guys, here are the share of the people in the

population.

If you look at class identity, there is no distortion

in the ideal policy on the one culture.

Again, assuming there is no correlation across the two dimensions.

Okay.

If there is no correlation of the two dimensions, there

is no distortion on the culture.

If the would be correlation on the two dimensions.

Okay.

If I have a class identity, I distort the epsilons.

But I also distort the size because the size are

correlated with that.

Okay.

Right.

So if there is correlation and I think that everyone

that is richer is also more progressive maybe.

Right.

So my distortion along this particular dimension, you know, would

also create a distortion here.

Not as large as if I identify them correctly.

Okay, but to get the main point, let's assume there

is no correlation.

So if I identify a class.

Okay.

If I identify on class, you know, I could have

a.

High.

Assuming that the poor are more numerous I can have

I will have, uh, a higher accident.

Then what the average voter would have wanted without this.

Okay.

And a standard ideal policy here.

Whereas if I identify on culture.

Okay.

Then I'll have the standard taxation.

And the ideal policy that I'm going to have is

going to be biased.

More to the left.

If the average voter is more socially conservative, more to

the right of the average for small socially progressive.

Okay.

So again, the typical question in the literature is actually

why don't we see a tax rate?

That is what we think should be higher, right?

We see taxes that are typically lower than what the

median voter should want.

Uh.

So this doesn't give us really the answer.

Right.

So here the you know, the average tax is if

we have cultural identity is the right one and otherwise

we have a higher tax rate.

So to see if we can get a lower tax

than this.

We would have.

We would need to have.

Uh.

So yeah, I actually don't.

So we would.

What type of correlation between culture and class?

Uh.

I don't think you can get it in this one.

There's no way.

It will always be in in the same direction.

Okay.

Because I would always estimate the difference between my group

and the other group in a way that exacerbate this

difference.

So if in the to the average voter, then it

was always me.

So remember, the assumption here is that I identify with

the with the group that that has the largest common.

Okay.

So the way I assumed it, that there is no

correlation between the dimension.

I mean, essentially it's going to be symmetric.

So the rich if the pool C, the income is

a larger conflict than the than the social, the social

issue also the recruited.

So everyone will identify according to class and.

Okay.

So when is it going to be the case.

So again we assume identification according to class.

We see the.

The.

Conflict that we have on taxation and the conflict that

we have on culture here.

There is no conflict on culture and there is a

conflict on taxation.

So this is obviously sustained multiple.

Okay.

A bit more tricky if there is correlation.

Uh, and here's the same.

If we somehow identify according to culture, there is, of

course, a bigger conflict according to culture rather than according

to to income.

Okay, so both are sustainable.

Um, and then we can ask, you know, so then

how do we.

So.

So essentially identity creates a larger conflict than there is

and reinforces its choice of identity.

And uh.

And you can see so that may be and so

there is an interest for the rich in this model

to shift the conflict away from class conflict to culture

conflict.

Okay.

So if you ask how, you know, politicians can affect

potentially the silence of a conflict.

Which conflict would they like to choose?

So if you care more about material outcomes, then.

You know, you should favour, uh, cultural conflict.

But again, what I'm saying is a bit something outside

the model, right.

Because caring about the material outcomes should be part of

this parameter.

It's almost like, okay, you identify more with that.

It's more important for you.

Then it's very hard to avoid this trap of actually

identifying accordingly.

Okay.

So I can only make this work by thinking about,

you know, there is, uh.

Uh, sort of political class that, uh, that is outside

this and looks at these two and sort of manipulate

as okay.

But.

Okay.

It's interesting that the identity, I mean, it's a part

of the assumption of the model, but the identities which

affect both policy if we switch from this to this,

okay, both policies are affected because we change the dimensions

in which we create these, these stereotypes and hence um.

So the switch would be less pronounced if these dimensions

are called because.

Right.

It's most pronounced when there is independence of course.

Of course this divergence or sorry if.

Yeah, if it's positively correlated it's less pronounced if I

avoid correlation.

If I have correlated.

I think in general in these models.

So there are lots of assumptions.

Uh.

There are a lot of assumptions.

The results are not too surprising.

Okay.

Um.

I think there is this tension about trying to think,

how do we think about the world if they think

about.

Um.

Where I am compared to other people, maybe I put

more different, more weight on differences and accessible differences.

But if I just interact with the people around me

and I think that's the whole world, okay, then we

would think that people are more similar, right?

And both of these have some endogenous element All right.

For example, why am I interacting with more people that

are like me?

Maybe this is something that I, I choose.

So at some level I can't choose it because if,

you know, if I need to live somewhere and my

income is low, I'm going to just be in a

neighbourhood in which everyone around me has low income.

Uh, but if my income is high, okay, I could

choose to live in a neighbourhood with people with low

income.

Or I could choose to segregate myself in a neighbourhood.

People with the same incomes me.

So some of it is by choice.

Some of these.

These.

I have no choice.

I can only live in an area where housing prices

are all right.

The price.

And this assumption of identity versus sort of, uh, so

choosing to identify versus how am I identified by others?

Again, in many models in political economy, we assume that

it's possible to target individuals.

Okay.

Uh, but this is according to observe, you know, very

clear observable.

uh, dimensions.

Or not?

I mean, it may be it's more difficult if you

try and target individuals for particular welfare benefits.

For some stability, though, it's hard to.

It's hard to prove.

Um.

But in terms of, you know, current political trends, I

mean, we clearly, you know, you can see in some

countries people are more aligned on the class conflict.

In some countries, people are more aligned on sort of

divisions among the poorer.

And that depends on how diversity among the poor and

so on.

So some of this is going on, uh.

I think again, we go back to several issues that

we described in other lectures is that clearly the multi

dimensional policy space is desperate, space is multi dimensional.

There could be some correlation across this dimension.

And what we choose to focus on and how we

choose to mitigate them has an equilibrium element to it.

Okay.

Um.

Here the assumption is that, you know, all the poor

would identify in the same way.

For example, I'm sure in reality, you know, the also,

the fact that I would choose to identify with something

doesn't mean that someone similar to me or, or people

are not always, uh, behaving in the same way on

this.

There is a lot of issue of coordination, right?

So we somehow need to coordinate on on identity to

be effective.

Maybe one to demand something for.

The thing at the heart of it.

It's really I mean, there is no big difference between

interest groups and and groups that, you know, they want

more to themselves.

Okay.

You're both the rich and the poor.

The more the, the, the conflict becomes more pronounced.

And in this way, they just want more to themselves,

the rich, less taxation, the taxation to the standard, let's

say.

So technically, it's.

Just a.

Case of what issues become salience.

Uh.

As I mentioned and also on existing, you know, beliefs

can be formed is either thinking about us versus them

or just looking at people in my environment.

The flip coin of being able to target or being

able to form preferences is part of the goal.

The flip point of the flip side of that is

if I'm able to target, I'm also able to discriminate.

Okay, so once we form groups and we identify groups,

it's also discrimination is also possible.

So that that would be the next uh, topic that

I would like to look at.

Okay.

So so I mean, I would leave sort of the

formal paper for papers for next time, but In general,

we would think that there is some inherent relations between

discrimination and identity, because discrimination allows me to sort of

identify because how to form an interest groups, maybe, okay,

discrimination is based on some identity, but also creates identity.

And again, there are the same issues when we think

about discrimination, the standard, uh, issues that we like to

preferences and information.

So the Becker model of discrimination again based on preferences,

people just don't like others.

And that's why they scream okay.

I mean the key.

I think the key problem in this is that it

makes it I mean, it means the discrimination is is

has good normative properties because if you maximise the utility

of people and you think about those that want to

discriminate, it's efficient to discriminate.

Right?

Because it's in the it's in the preferences, okay.

There is a majority in society that likes to discriminate

against minority average utility.

And it will be happy about discrimination as well.

Um.

But it could be the discrimination comes from preferences and

that could create identity and that could exacerbate, uh, the

way I view other people in terms of my preferences

as in the first model.

And that could increase discrimination.

Okay.

So there is potentially an element of preferences is we

had today and an element of beliefs.

So that is the literature that arises from the idea

of statistical discrimination.

So I will discriminate because when I look at this

identity, this particular group, uh, maybe I have less information

about them.

So I don't want to hire them.

Uh, maybe I have beliefs that they are sort of

less competent.

Okay.

So it could, I, I could have a difference in

the perceived differences in the mean of the competence.

But I could also have thinking about the same mean,

but the differences in the variance.

Right.

If I have less information about the group because I've

seen less, we've seen less of the versions of them.

It's more risky.

So I don't want to hire.

Okay.

And then this discriminate discriminatory potentially again efficient decision.

Right.

Because it's based on information rational updating based updating.

This particular discrimination creates now an even more observed differences

in these two identities.

And uh.

Which creates a self-fulfilling environment.

Right.

If I know that I'm not going to get a

job, then I should not invest in, uh, in my

skills.

Right?

Because people are not going to hire me because they

don't look at me.

They look at my it's my association with my group,

right?

They don't look at individuals.

They they can get a signal about the individual with

the interview and so on.

But they also use their prime again, which is from

our point of view, as economists.

It's an efficient thing to do.

Okay, so I used to.

Try to generalise about people, given the population which belongs

to.

Okay.

And not supposed to do it in trials, for example,

in the court, you're not supposed to use it prior

on the population that you belong to.

But the point of the column is if you have

information about general characteristics of the population, it's absolutely fine.

Actually, you need to.

Consider questions.

If people are using I think in courts, it's not

allowed to do this because people would think that the

prior is probably wrong, just probably correct that it's wrong

and that you're not putting the right weight on the

prior versus the individual.

Okay.

So for example, you're not supposed to know, you know,

if you look at the defendant, you're also not supposed

to use previous, uh, convictions and stuff.

Right.

You're not looking for the history.

Maybe a point in which.

You give.

The punishment your decision whether the person is not supposed

to respond.

Okay, so here, you know, again, you can see the

the link.

So if, if employers look at me as, you know,

a woman rather than as myself, then I would change

my behaviour also.

Right.

So with this sort of proposed identity, I would change

my behaviour and which will imply that.

So I will sort of invest maybe less in education

because I know I'm not getting the same stream of

payoffs later on.

And then, uh, that means that the characteristics of the

two groups are changing.

So there is sort of test based discrimination and self-fulfilling

statistical discrimination.

It is not about preferences but about information.

Uh, that is correct on average, because it affects the

decisions of these particular groups.

And then the more recent literature, which is what I'm

going to look at, is a literature which takes into

consideration the fact that, you know, so it's not about

preferences, it's about beliefs.

But often we have wrong beliefs, all sorts of misspecified

models about the value of those and what you know,

how can this be corrected?

Okay.

We need it for next week.

You know, in general, when we think about this, the

the we take more seriously the policies that we talked

about today.

If we think about the cultural dimension of a nation

versus others, I mean, that typically leads to Formal policies

of discrimination.

Questions.

This is more of an introduction for next week.

I guess you know, it's a form of identity.

You have to create an observable signal so that all

of us can recognise you as a group.

Yeah.

Which is useful for representing yourself politically, because it means

that you have an incentive to assert your beliefs.

You're sorry your the interests of your identity politically, But

that also opens you up to discrimination.

Yeah.

That's like a trade off.

For that.

Some signals are so observable that there's going to be

discriminate against always kind of gender.

Yeah.

So I think again.

The.

The term identity politics was coined because groups felt discriminated

and try to get more rights.

And then the accusation was are you just playing on

your identity?

You want to get some stuff because of your.

So sometimes the I would say that the, the direction

is relatively clear from discrimination to forming an identity to

fight this discrimination.

And.

I would say that.

Yeah.

It.

Yeah.

And maybe because of that.

So once a particular group, you know, let's say the

groups A and B.

So not for me to get into too much political

hot water which okay.

So let's say group feels discriminated okay.

And tries to that that creates a strong identity potentially

for B that might have not been there before.

Okay.

Because I'm interested in that.

I often ask people, you know what.

How strong is your identity and what identity do you

have?

So a lot of, uh, uh, you know, men that

that I talk to say, okay, I didn't feel strongly

as a man.

Of course I am.

But I didn't feel strongly as a man until I

was, you know, accused of being a discriminatory or the.

Um.

That's part of what people are saying about Two movement

that it created the backlash that, you know, men felt

more defensive and created a stronger identity force.

Uh.

That's like, um, um, uh.

Immigration.

It's not I don't think it's the strong identity of

immigrants.

I don't think so.

Uh.

Right.

In some places.

At the same time, regarding, uh, immigration, I read that,

especially since in France, like there are some political studies

that show that some of the voters that are opposing

themselves to immigration.

It feels like it is a lot as a reaction

that what I read was that they are very they

associate themselves with like a sort of middle class and

they really, um, attached to that middle class.

And so they are very concerned that migrants who they

see as lower than them in the ranking remain at

the bottom.

And so that's why they don't want, um, more redistribution

towards them, because they, they seem to feel somehow like,

um, a reversal of the ordering.

And so it feels that in a way, they sort

of created and built an identity like this that was

as a response, like a.

Sort of.

Ordering like a classification as a response to a migration,

actually.

Like, not necessarily as just like, uh, this is my

nationality and this is, uh, deference, but also just we

are in a certain economic class.

And if migrants come, then in my end, they get

benefits.

It might change the ordering of society.

And it doesn't change those of society if the non

migrants get benefits.

I think that's the.

So it's very weird.

Yeah.

But they yeah they seem to be very concerned somehow

like they seem to be looking a lot unto them

somehow and very concerned about the fact that people that

are below them are not getting anything new because it

could potentially put them, uh, above.

And so they somehow think that under them is only,

um, or at least like mostly migrants.

Uh, so.

Yeah.

Or that, uh, somehow social mobility for the old order

is quite, uh, it's hard to break into.

Yeah.

Okay.

But maybe a lot of economic migrants actually come skills

that are higher than you need them.

And so that could be a risk.

Um.

I think the whole interaction of somehow income and other

characteristics.

So I guess that's the question.

What do they mean when they say middle class?

Is it really income or is it something they're created

around culture or, um, general?

I can see why groups would want, you know, they

have some privileged access to something.

For example, you know, we all know each other.

We nominate each other.

As.

Judges.

We all have jobs, kids to get internships here and

there.

So we have we are typically somehow recognise each other

from our accent look.

So it's easy for us to cooperate in this familiar

world.

And so some potentially way of thinking is that, you

know, if other people get into this, either are cooperative

breaks down or simply.

It's going.

To block the chances, which is what you find.

It's just protecting you.

But again, it's endogenous.

What this class of yours is.

Think income is a strong predictor of how people are.

They sometimes tolerate diversity.

If it's the same there are some other characteristics.

It's not so much.

Different in different countries.

So I think in France there is a lot of

segregation based on income and on.

Religion.

Whereas in the UK I think there is less segregation

in terms of where people live.

So maybe easier to.

Create should be easier.

Maybe to create coalitions on class one.

Yeah, I think these are big issues and we don't

have a good solution.

Yeah.

But already recognising the links between stuff.

So this stuff we talked about class discrimination I think.

That's important.

Good.

Good.

I'll see you next week for the lecture.

And, uh.

So Tuesdays I might go on.

Tuesday.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I'll say yes.

Are you ready for Christmas holidays?

I mean, generally, yes.

I mean, no.

Sir.

We could live another way.

Yeah.

This protest around the U.S. government.

For example.

So.

What I was.

So sorry.

To share.

My ideas.

Yeah, yeah.

I don't like coordination, cause.

Like, I think I like.

The old cheddar cheese.

Maybe I was thinking.

Anyway, when.

That was your first.

Hello there.

Is this the old Cheshire?

Yes.

The only thing that matters.

Yeah.

Then I refuse to accept that.

I have to ask you.

How about this?

I'm sorry.

Yes.

I'm here for the final.

Right?

Exactly.

So.

This should be.

Your.

Experience.

That's what I want.

Yeah.

Let's just say that's a relatively efficient day.

Exactly.

So spill-over effects.

Yeah.

And I was wondering if there are papers that can.

Okay.

Because right now, I don't know how to.

Yes.

So typically people think about bed for discussion, which is

everything here.

Uh, but, uh.

Because the anecdotal evidence is that in Italy there's an

industrial district of Prato, where they do textile industry, and

it's full of Chinese firms.

And only now they're starting to emerge more and more

like workers that are protesting.

But these are workers from Bangladesh or Pakistan.

And so it's like Bangladesh and Paris and against Chinese

owners.

So you see that.

Before it was Chinese workers.

Yeah.

Okay.

And and so the thing is.

Is working in Chinese.

I'm used to the order, the standard order of the

Chinese environment.

And now the other immigrants, either they come from a

more authoritarian country, in which case.

Maybe they.

Don't.

Well, they may come from different countries.

Something of that?

Yes, exactly.

And that is actually a nice idea.

Yeah.

I'm thinking about, like, how to.

Yeah.

Also, whether it's unions have a role, maybe because once

you have these formal institutions, then maybe it's easier to

deal with diversity.

Yes.

But, uh, some sort.

Of unions were relatively powerful, and they lose their power

and then be energised by us meeting their.

Conditions.

Yeah.

That's, uh, really bad for some Amazon workers to be

able to take.

Yeah, exactly.

Oh, I see that.

Hi.

Hi.

Sorry.

All right, so take your time.

All right.

Thank you so much.

Yeah.

Okay.

Yeah.

And if you have in mind some papers.

Okay.

Okay.

And then next.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Well, thank you so much.

So somebody already left you these two?

Not me.

Okay.

This one probably left.

Yeah.

So, just so you know.

Yeah.

Thank you.

What's your what?

What is it?

No.

Yes.

Okay.

So what do you what do we do?

Yeah, it's it's really empirical.

So.

No, but it's good to.

I think the thinking about the mechanics helps you then.

Yeah, exactly.

It's very important.

It's right now I look in the path and it's

very hard also.

Yeah.

Of unions differently than immigrants are scared of immigrants.

So there's more unionisation.

There are many dimensions and still thinking how to focus.

Yeah.

It's not simple.

You can always go.

Okay.

Thank you.

All right.

Thanks.

Your friend is stateside today?

Yes.

So it's far.

Is in Atlanta.

Oh, okay.

So here just.

We just.

Just a year.

Is it?

Yeah.

You know, of course.

So are you going back to visit your family for

Christmas?

I am, I'm so excited.

Nice, nice.

He has.

Ask how much.

You know the flights to.

Uh, I tried to make it to Japan, but this

year.

This winter.

Christmas is crazy expensive.

Well, I managed.

To save it miles.

So I got flights there and back for relatively cheap.

But I was looking at them like, even in the

back of the plane, it was like $700.

I was like, oh my God.

This is good.

I know my friend from home texted me yesterday and

she was, are you home for Thanksgiving?

They don't celebrate Thanksgiving here.

I mean, I have to go back twice, aren't you?

I'm not going back for Thanksgiving.

We don't even celebrate it.

Yeah, I don't think I can make it this year.

Oh, okay.

Back home.

Mhm.

Yeah.

I have to wait till um.

Yes I think.

It's fine.

What happens?

It's okay.

Right.

Good afternoon.

Right.

Oh.

Right.

I know.

I always overestimate how long does it take to walk

here?

And I got here in one minute.

Just today.

A full day for you.

Uh, you know, it starts.

It starts at yet?

While you were on that one.

It's actually just from 1 to 3 today.

But I do a lot of work.

Right.

It's just like a table.

Yeah, I know every every week there's one face.

Are you sure there's a table on there?

I must read it.

I'm just going on.

I don't think the door's showing.

No effort to.

It's like.

I know it's like a seminar.

I can actually see it.

I think it's just modules and modules.

You have to take it.

Otherwise it doesn't go through the door, isn't it?

What's going on?

Do we have.

More?

Yeah, we have another one.

I swear there was a little table last year.

Last year?

It definitely.

Was.

This is.

Brilliant.

I hope.

I hope by the end of the module.

Standard C is rising.

Right.

Good morning.

I didn't email them.

It could be.

Couldn't just for her lower table at the very beginning.

I wasn't happy, I said, but it's not a cafe.

There's a seminar and I stayed and they said, I'm

sorry.

We cannot change the furniture.

Estates Division has no mercy.

Oh my goodness.

Small seminar today.

Okay, good.

I think everyone a lot of them are sick at

the moment.

Something is going around I can tell you about.

Kind of disturbing.

Yeah.

Just before last week.

First week of December.

Okay.

You know, they left.

This morning.

For Thanksgiving.

I think I will also my.

I guess my.

Lecture 10:

Wow, you're really busy.

Yeah.

Always wondering.

I guess that lecture is cancelled.

Yeah.

Well, do you have a business?

Is this your last meeting?

Uh, no.

I'll come back for the spring as well.

But I'm going home for Christmas.

Okay.

Yeah.

Hold it.

Oh.

Too bad.

No.

You're from here, right?

Yeah.

Okay, so you may be going home, but it's not

a very much of a treat.

Aha.

I don't think I'll even go home.

Maybe I will.

That's when you got the option, huh?

How are you doing?

Okay.

Not bad.

When are you heading back?

Next Thursday.

Hopefully sometime.

Um.

No.

I mean, like, work plans.

How boring is that?

Going to be my research.

Yeah, except for the fact that I'm kind of just

going back to bed, but I'm also going back to

Nairobi.

I mean, going to Nairobi.

Like, what I'm going to do is just for research

work.

Okay.

So when are you going to Nairobi?

Uh, right before then.

Okay.

Are you running up my experiment?

Yeah.

How do you even find villages that in being experimented

on?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Shortly we've run out, I think.

Yeah.

I'm.

I don't know.

I'm probably not a baby, but, like, still like a

toddler in, you know, doing some experiments.

Yeah, I'm learning a little stuff.

Yeah.

And then.

I don't know, still.

There's so many things that you can, you know, you

don't have any control over what we do, right?

Okay?

Yeah.

Okay.

Um.

So this is how we finished last week, right?

We looked at model identity.

So I'm using here the word identity or identifiability that

other people can identify me.

Uh, this can allow for discrimination of different policies based

on this particular identity.

So this gives us a.

Uh, a clear transition into this question of discrimination.

Um.

If we think about discrimination within sort of, uh, economic

policies, any economic policy or policy outcome that is sort

of favours one group compared to the other could potentially

be be, uh, interpreted as discrimination.

And the traditional model in economics were divided into two

types of explanations for the discrimination I mentioned last week.

So the first attack by Becker looked at, uh, I

think it's 1973 already looked at simply putting preferences, bias,

preferences.

Were working with a particular group, having a relationship with

a particular group.

So this is test based discrimination.

So you simply put it in a in the utility

function.

And the second type that was advocated by Phelps and

Arrow of discrimination was called statistical discrimination.

And this.

Okay.

Which is based on the idea that.

That, um.

That we have different information.

About different groups.

So for example, we can think that group A has

is less productive on average than could be.

Okay.

This is our belief.

And if we think that group A is less productive

than group then.

Then we're going to give whenever someone from Group A,

so again, it has to be something that we recognise

this person has been from this day.

So like wage that is lower right.

So some of us.

Anticipating this, anticipating that you're going to get a lower

wage in the market.

Perhaps people in Group A.

Invest less in productivity or in education let's say, than

people in Group B.

So these beliefs are true.

They become self-fulfilling.

And we can be stuck in an equilibrium in which

to live in force.

The individual behaviour and the individual behaviour enforces these beliefs.

And so, um.

Firms are correct In that environment to provide a lower

wage.

This particular.

That also sort of the papers that looking at the

labour market and saying okay, imagine some employers have these

beliefs and some employers don't have these reviews.

Okay.

So you can create a situation of some form of

segregation.

So there will be some employers that will focus on

hiring a workers okay.

And employers, some hiring workers.

I'm going to get the segregation.

And another version of this is that, uh.

Here.

My beliefs are biased correctly.

Okay, so my mean beliefs on this population is different,

but it could be that I think they have the

same mean.

But I have very little experience with type A workers.

So I see a bigger variance if I have some

risk attitude.

So typically we don't think about employers.

But yeah it's possible that I have some risk attitude.

I'm more reluctant to hire an A worker.

Okay.

So I think the mean is the same.

Does it have a greater variance.

Because maybe now these people just entered the job market

and I have less experience.

So I'm more reluctant to hire those that I have

less information about.

And given that it's also self-fulfilling in the market because

if people don't hire them, we experience less of them

and we remain with less.

So different mean is sort of self-fulfilling.

And greater variance is also self-fulfilling in the sense that

we just don't experience.

And that's perfectly.

So it could be that often a lot of papers

that deal with statistical discrimination, uh, show how maybe even

a small difference, small initial difference can create large differences

in outcome.

So, um, for example, assume that populations A and B

are the same in terms of their productivity.

But we have different signal technologies which are these are

the signals that we use to signal our ability to,

uh, influence.

Okay.

Okay.

So this signal technology can result in greater variance for

one of these groups.

Um.

And then I may not even bother looking at it.

Given that I know that the population are the same,

if I'm getting less information from person A, it's more

efficient for me to look at those.

Okay.

And then next generation of models, which is what I'm

going to focus on today because we are thinking about

sort of behavioural political economy is uh, a version of

statistical discrimination with.

Uh, with wrong beliefs.

So I was motivated in the following way.

So, you know, sort of statistical discrimination seems to be

morally superior as an explanation of discrimination to those who

do test based discrimination, because it's really new preferences.

People don't want to think about themselves as racist.

So this is for example.

So this is a better way to think about discrimination

potentially.

But there is also some uneasiness with statistical discrimination.

As I mentioned last time, sometimes we block general information

about a particular group or even information about a particular

individual, such as in court cases.

We are not allowing juries to know about the history

of the of the what to be the history to

the history of the particular defendant.

Okay.

Even though again, from an economist point of view, this

history might tell us that the defendant is more likely

to be guilty or less likely to be guilty.

Okay.

So the uneasiness comes from the fact that so where

is the uneasiness coming from?

Okay.

Compared to again, this idea, it's efficient to use all

the information about someone's time.

So I think then uneasiness comes from the fact that

often this information is actually not very reliable and should

be wrong.

And maybe people put this information, general information or information

about the past, an information about the present in the

wrong way.

So maybe they put too much information on the prior

compared to what you see.

Uh, or they just think the updating the wrong way,

or maybe the information that their prior information may be

wrong.

And I think this is a big part of why

there is an easiness even with models of statistics.

Okay.

So we're going to.

Think about this second generation of statistical discrimination models.

So uh.

So this actually I've mentioned right, different signalling technologies, endogenous

selection of signals.

If you think one signal is less accurate than the

other and you have limited resources, you can focus on

the more accurate signal.

Okay.

And now I'm going to look at discrimination with wrong

beliefs.

So we've already mentioned last week this model of stereotypes

that was used in the paper, uh, of uh, generally

the Bolivian bonhomie.

Okay.

In which just a small difference between two population makes

you create sort of large differences in your mind.

These two papers.

Okay.

I'm part of a literature about about a lot of

the literature that considered misspecified models.

Okay.

The idea of misspecified models is that you really have

one element of the information set that is wrong, and

you will never really updating this particular element.

So you stuck with this wrong, for example a wrong

prior.

Okay.

And.

And this is going to affect how you update about

other work.

Okay.

So just briefly high dose and struck.

They look at an environment in.

Which.

For example.

As the we discussed in the first lecture, your outcomes

are a function of ability and effort.

Imagine you overestimate your ability.

Okay.

So you think your ability is very high.

It's wrong.

You have the misspecified belief about your ability or never

updating this, right?

And when you see good outcomes, you think, uh, that,

you know, it's mostly comes from your ability.

You don't need to put as much effort.

So now let's expand this into think about, uh, sorry,

let's think about ability and luck rather than ability network

okay.

So if you see good outcomes you think it comes

from your ability.

Okay.

And now instead of luck, let's think about privilege or

discrimination okay.

If you think you have high ability and you see

good outcomes, you don't think you are privileged okay.

And but if you think other groups ability is low

okay.

And you see bad outcomes for them, you also don't

think they're discriminated, that you just think it's because of

therapy.

Okay.

So you can interpret if you are if you're stuck

with, uh, a very strong belief that you're not changing,

that your group, that group disability is very high.

And you see people from your own group, let's say,

not succeeding.

Then you're going to say that they are potentially being

discriminated.

And if you think another group has very low ability

and they are.

And you see that they um, that they are not

successful, you will explain it by their ability.

So you have wrong belief on one element and then

you're trying to learn, you know, what's the level of

privilege or discrimination that exists in society.

But you're going to learn this in the wrong way

because one element of your information structure is wrong.

From.

Okay.

The next paper that I'm going to now sort of

describing more details finally, uh, by Boren Hagen Amos.

Takes these ideas and put them into, uh, a dynamic

framework.

So I tell you, the experiment that they did, they

did an experiment on some math website in which you

can ask questions and people sort of answer questions, answer

your questions, and then you can rank or Rate the

answer that you have been given.

So they did some experiments and elicited beliefs of individuals

on different experts on this website.

Those that have, you know, are potentially given answers in

the past.

And so they observed in the first round that that

people in general give higher rates ratings to men rather

than women.

And then they give them more data about questions, or

they give them data about questions that were answered.

And after this set of questions were answered, then they

asked them again for this rating.

And then they see that there is a reversal and

people give much higher rating to convert to.

Okay.

So their interpretation of this is that, you know, you

start from biased beliefs.

Uh, so people start from.

Some biased beliefs.

Okay.

And.

And if you can see people now, if you can

see women now answering questions very well.

Okay.

You're going to think that the, the set of women

that were selected now to answer these questions are often

much higher.

Okay.

So you're sort of positively surprised and you're going to

update a lot.

That's one possibility.

But they also use different people for the first ranking

and the second backing.

So what they interpret it in the way in a

way that says, okay, the people in the second round

realised that the people in the first round.

They were biased in their beliefs.

And now in the second round, we're actually correct.

Okay.

So in sort of an environment of social learning, we

are learning together.

I see the outcomes of those people before me potentially.

I think that they had the Misspecified model.

Okay.

So they play some wrong beliefs, the Misspecified model.

And now I'm potentially correcting.

So not only so it could be that, you know,

you can think about misspecified models.

Is everyone suffering from this.

So we can think about people correcting, especially if we

think about dynamics of discrimination.

We can think that, you know, throughout history there was

more discrimination.

And maybe now we are correcting this up to some

degree.

Okay.

So this may have been a bit ambiguous.

So let's go to the model and presenting a slightly

different version of their model.

So I worked a lot on models with social learning

and recently on social learning with misspecified models.

Um, okay.

So let's suppose that women and men distribution over talent

is some g of theta.

So I'm denoting g zero for period zero.

So maybe think about some normal distribution.

Over talent.

And now I'm going to have some output of signal

technology which is going to be a function of your

ability plus some noise.

Okay.

So let's also have the noise as a normal distribution.

So you're going to this is what people are going

to observe.

And they have this particular.

Okay.

So for for cohort zero.

So period zero I start with this prior.

And then I have someone that selects individuals with output

of sig output or signal let's say above y upper

bar okay.

And then these are the people that are sort of

get good ranking for example.

Okay.

And I'm putting some discrimination in the model of privilege.

Now, I'm assuming that people don't realise that when they

observe signal.

Created by men, then the signal they perceive the signal

is more than it really is.

Okay.

So I give a boost to the signal, which they

don't realise that they do.

Okay.

Okay.

So then if I'm thinking about the distribution of talent

data at cohort one of those, everyone that was promoted

after the first stage after stage zero okay.

Okay.

So what does it take for you to be promoted

if your ability to.

Okay.

You just need a signal epsilon such that pi plus

f of theta plus epsilon is greater or equal to

y alpha.

So all the epsilons that create this, uh, that would

create that would be, you know, boost you from pi

plus f of theta to be above or above.

Okay.

Would allow you, uh, to be promoted.

So that's the measure okay.

That's the measure of epsilon that would allow that theta.

That's the.

The probability uh, of epsilons that would allow that to

be promoted.

Okay.

So I can settle for a lower epsilon.

Given this boost pi, I can settle for a lower

epsilon and still be promoted.

Or in other words, for the same epsilon.

Okay.

I need a lower ability to be promoted compared to

that of a woman.

Okay, so this means that there are less women that

are going to be promoted because of this post office.

But the distribution of women that are promoted first order

stochastically dominates that of men.

Right.

So this can create this reversal, which is what they

discuss in the paper, that if the first period evaluations

were biased in some way, when I look at the

people that have sort of survived the first period, then

I should think higher, highly, more highly about those that

were discriminated.

Okay.

Now, if you repeat this over time.

Okay.

So now.

So.

We sort of need to think what happens to the

selectors over time okay.

So let's think first that everyone has the same pie.

So we're all discriminating the same way okay.

But we're simply facing.

Better distributed okay.

Okay.

So over time.

Okay.

The perceived difference between the output of men and women

is going to decrease over time.

Right?

And at the rate which is faster when the variance

of epsilon is lower.

Why is that?

If there is huge variance, then this.

First of all, this stochastic dominance is not really going

to bite, right?

Because everything almost is going to be because of the.

Okay.

So you can think about this dynamic employment process.

You know, selection of.

You know, there are a lot of things that may

change in sort of a dynamic employment process.

One thing is the level of the noise.

Maybe in the beginning the noise is very large.

So this effect of stochastic dominance is is quite small.

Okay.

But maybe you know, we know sort of maybe where

the select was at higher levels, maybe they're doing a

better job.

So maybe the noise is lower later on.

Uh discrimination at different levels may be different.

Okay.

Again because of a different experience.

Okay.

And this is the point in which actually if the

employer at the second period does not discriminate or.

Because of the first order stochastic dominance.

Now we will see women more successful than okay.

So after the first period, uh, we get the first

order stochastic dominance effect.

But if the selectors are still discriminating in the same

way as before, okay, this is a first order effect

which is bigger than the first order stochastic dominance okay.

So there will still be discrimination against women.

Even though you get a just over time it will

decrease in decreasing in the limit.

But if now I realise that there is this discrimination

okay, we would get the effect of, you know what

people sometimes call positive discrimination in employment, I think, right,

that okay, you understand that the previous generation Racially discriminate

and now you're not discriminated anymore discriminating anymore.

And so you realise that you are facing, uh, sort

of a selection with a selection effect.

And then you will more likely.

This is definitely what everyone thinks about themselves, right?

That other people are discriminating, but I'm not discriminatory.

Okay.

So.

Okay.

So it's a really nice paper to look at.

Uh.

Now I'm going to add another stage, which is not

to write in the paper okay.

In which you can actually also invest some effort.

Good.

So let me do it so carefully.

Okay.

So this is your signal technology.

It's your simply linear in your ability.

Then there's going to be this boost in the way

the signal is interpreted.

Okay.

Uh x is going to be effort that you're going

to invest.

And Epsilon is noise as before.

Okay.

And again again you get a reward if you are?

If your signal is above somewhere up above and zero

otherwise and there is some cost of effort?

Okay.

So that that sort of tries to answer the question,

okay.

If I understand my chances of being promoted or getting

a higher salary or whatever, if I'm discriminated against or

in favour, am I going to put more effort or

less effort?

Right.

So in the self-fulfilling literature, there was a clear element

of putting less effort because my chances of getting a

high wage are low.

Okay, so what am I maximising now?

The probability of being promoted is equal to what we

did before, right?

Now you have also x here because I can influence

that.

Okay.

So it's different for men and women.

So if I'm promoted I get one minus the cost

of effort.

Okay.

So it's a simple first order condition.

Um.

Okay.

So that's the marginal cost of effort.

And that's the marginal benefit.

Right?

Just the marginal chance.

You're essentially looking at the epsilon.

You know, the the sort of the probability of the

epsilon that is going to switch you from being below

the bar to above.

So if I think about if you think about this

condition, the way it is set up, especially with the

linear effect of a penalty On effort.

We can just interpret a man of type theta to

behave as if he is a woman of type theta

plus pi.

Okay.

Right.

So it is as if a man thinks, okay, doesn't

have to think.

You can think that it's privileged, or a man thinks

he has higher ability than a woman.

It's exactly the same type of model.

Or it's just another interpretation.

The model if you misperceived your ability to be higher

and everyone else is perceived to be hard, then truly

is okay.

Okay, so now I'm looking at the distribution of epsilon

Okay.

Just a distribution of epsilon.

Uh, somewhere we have.

You know why?

Upper bar.

So we need theta plus x plus epsilon to be

greater than y upper bar.

So if my theta is quite high, right.

If my theta is quite high then.

You know, all these epsilons are going to be good

uniformly.

Right.

So the higher is my theta.

So if I think that actually it's theta plus pi

then I will think that I, it's even enough for

me to get this epsilon in order to.

I.

Think have to be promoted.

Okay.

So if I think about a larger set of epsilon

that would allow me to be true.

So for high enough theta.

Okay, enough that I can think about negative epsilons.

So for high enough data.

So this is the epsilon that I'm looking at the

marginal epsilon right.

Okay.

The marginal epsilon to be it to be equal to.

Okay.

So for high enough data.

Okay.

So high enough data investing uh investing higher effort okay.

Investing higher effort.

Doesn't, you know, doesn't increase that much.

Right.

I'm on the decreasing slope here.

Doesn't increase the increase that much the probability of being

promoted.

Which essentially is going to tell us that sort of

higher data invest less.

Right.

Whereas if your theta is relatively low.

So you think you need epsilons in this region.

So your epsilons have to be higher than, you know

on the positive side.

Investing more really gives you this boost.

Signal gives you a higher high boost.

So for low theta.

For low ranges of theta.

Investing gives you a higher boost.

Which translates if I really.

What I want to know is how X is affected

by different.

Okay.

I want to know who's investing more okay.

So if we're in the realm of low enough theta,

if they were in the region of low enough data.

This is going to be.

A.

Negative.

He seems to think.

So positive.

Okay.

And if we're in the realm that this is for

low data and for high data, this is going to

be negative.

Okay.

So for all types below some Cut-Off, The level of

X is going to increase in their type, and for

all types above some Cut-Off above, the discount of the

level of X is going to decrease in the type.

And at some point you put you invest zero.

Okay.

Guys, for high enough that are the marginal benefit of

when I increase theta, the marginal benefit of increasing effort

is actually is actually.

Okay.

Here.

The marginal benefit for higher theta the marginal benefit of

increasing effort is called.

Here relates to low data because I'm looking.

Okay.

So this is for a general data.

And as I said, we can interpret men as perceiving

of themselves as having a higher data.

That's how the signal is interpreted.

Doesn't mean that they have the wrong beliefs.

So it's either comes from the outside or they have

their own beliefs.

But I mean, the outside has to interpret it this

way.

So high ability women are going to work harder than

men, but lower ability women are going to work less.

Okay.

Because of this.

The low ability of the skill, your X increases with

what you think about theta.

And for high ability, your X decreases when you think

you have a higher.

The point of this is to say when we think

about one group being discriminated against?

How it affects their effort is not obvious.

It may affect effort in different way.

Okay.

It's not the result that I described here.

Relatively sensitive to the distributional assumption.

And epsilon okay.

It can be more general for local k.

But still I've used this here.

Okay.

But it sort of goes on to say that if

we have to be careful, sometimes we think that groups

that are discriminated against put less effort.

Okay.

We have to think a little bit more carefully to

to look at different types of individuals within this group.

Right.

We think, you know, we always start with some distributional

assumption.

And it's not always going to be the case that

everyone is group of behaviours.

Okay, so if we try to fix the, let's say

previous generation discrimination and we say, okay, let me let

me know or fix maybe some unconscious bias.

Okay.

Let me now increase the objective standard for men that

cannot be affected by unconscious bias okay.

So it should fix it.

So first of all it should improve efficiency of selecting

the right individuals.

But it's also going to affect effort.

And as we see there for top quality for high

quality individuals it's going to now mitigate the effect that

we discussed before.

So it's going to increase the effort, the effort of

men and reduce the somewhat unnecessary effort of women to

win this competition.

Okay.

So this.

Is.

The paper by best Italian politicians in Sweden looked at,

uh, how quotas for women affected the quality of men

that, uh, That entered the competition and won.

Okay.

And they've seen an increase in the quality.

So that's a big issue with quotas right?

I mean, the first tendency is to say, okay, the

quotas will increase the quality because you are reducing standards

to a degree because, you know, but if reducing standards

is because we're actually have some unconscious bias and we're

discriminating, then it actually fixes inefficiency.

And if there is also effort at play, then we

may save on unnecessary effort and increase the effort is

sort of analogous to looking at higher quality, uh, in

this environment.

Okay.

But if we look at the if we are in

an environment in which this is sort of jobs with

lower quality involved, uh, we could have the opposite effect.

So again, sort of just this just calls for more

subtlety and nuanced way of thinking about about the effects.

Okay.

An implication of what we've done is that if you

look.

Okay.

If you look at the.

This is the perceived output okay.

So theta plus the bias for men plus the level

of output, a level of effort that they put x

of theta plus pi.

Okay.

And this is the perceived output for a woman okay.

And this because of you know the result about x

this is going to be less than pi okay.

Because the High Court women are going to put more

effort okay.

So that will reduce the difference.

But it's going to grow for the lower being.

The question.

Because.

And invest in Timmins.

Dawson's paper.

They look at, um.

Ability as measured from the entry tests of the army.

Yeah.

So I don't know if that's, like, a natural right

way to think about it for that, but.

It has to be more like, you know, the effort

that you invested before in education in your life.

And so.

So it's not, uh.

It's more about, I would say it's more about who,

who are putting themselves up for selection process and who

sort of gives that.

It's not, uh.

It's not 1 to this.

Well, it's more about the selection of parties that look

for higher quality candidates.

An effort is never really a one off if you

think about.

So obviously it's a more holistic process and we model

it in one particular way.

But you can think about selection efforts of.

That are done behalf of the party.

Okay.

So the boring paper is really an easy read, and

I think it's a nice experiment, but probably didn't do

the justice.

Uh.

This particular version of the paper, I, uh.

So the it's they have different assumptions, just different distribution

and assumption and so on.

But I've written this paper to actually present to the

department to discuss promotion.

And, uh.

Promotion and hiring.

So for example, if you think, you know, so in

the academic life, you go, you know, you finish your

PhD, you go on the job market and then you

get to become an assistant professor.

So maybe there is a lot of noise.

Then you go to the next level of promotion from

assistant professor to associate professor.

Maybe there is a less noisy signal so you can

think about this particular also in firm firms of course.

Right.

And go up the levels.

There should be less noise.

Uh, about the signal that you are, uh, that you're

showing.

Um.

It's not obvious what happens to the process of discrimination.

So it does look like.

The empirical evidence is this type of experiments, right, like

empirical evidence on these models for the implication?

Yeah.

Like there's no other.

Like, for example, were there any paper studying promotions or

things like.

Uh, it's very difficult to you have to control for

productivity.

Yeah.

But there are papers that look at uh, so this

is more difficult dynamic.

Right.

Uh, but there are papers now that so in terms

of productivity, it used to be a challenge.

But now we have more, uh, more measures.

So people look at, uh, lawyers, law firms in which

productivity is how many hours essentially you are leaving for

quarterly.

And, uh, so this is your billing for your company,

not your person.

And then they can show differences in salaries, conditional productivity.

So in fact the discrimination exists in controlling productivity.

This this now uh exists.

The dynamic is much more complicated.

There are famous papers in economics, uh, about the economics

profession, about, uh, co-authored papers.

Okay.

So there's a paper by Henderson's, uh, I think another

quote You.

Should remember.

Even that it's a paper on.

So she shows that conditional on the same output.

So you know published papers in the same journal or

the same measures that you can look at.

Uh, um.

Papers that are written by male and female co-authors don't

get the same value.

Promoted with high probability.

Did they try to then compare it to papers that

are co-authored by two women?

Yeah.

Yes.

I don't remember, but I think that's what they use.

Okay.

Yeah.

So the single authors, single author name, female finishing.

There is no effect.

Yes.

But again it's one it's only shows discrimination.

So it's promotion.

But it's just I think one stage is just much

more data for this basic level promotion.

Thank you.

Um, so I think there are also other studies in

other disciplines I think.

So the in academic disciplines, it's relatively easy to measure

productivity.

Um.

Or at least we all agree on the measures of

productivity.

It's much harder the type of teamwork that is done

in other companies.

Which is why they have this, uh, law firms, Saracens.

Uh.

Um.

Another paper on discrimination.

Of, uh, patients choosing doctors.

Okay, so there is a lot of data in the

US about doctors history of success in operations and so

on.

And when something bad happens, something bad happened to the

doctor in an operation.

So she didn't operate properly and someone died of complications.

So women doctors.

And punish much more than doctors, given everything else.

So by now we have very good measures of discrimination

or ways to measure discrimination.

This is more dynamic, so it's more difficult for that

way.

The experiments.

That were.

I mean, to a degree, this, uh, maybe it has

the dynamic features, bro.

You have beliefs.

And when you get a new signal, right, you are

reacting to the signal much more.

When the woman gets it than the bad signal.

And that means that you started from a low prior

or in different ways.

Uh.

And then there is the, the, the papers that look

at, you know, how to mitigate this.

So.

Um.

So if it's an issue of, you know, some level

wrong beliefs are very hard to, to fix, uh, if

you don't have enough information, then it's relatively easy to

think about, think about policy implications that we just increase

the level of information that you have.

You can do it in a credible way.

Uh, so quotas and affirmative action, as you know, you

know, it's a political minefield.

Uh.

Because the view is, I find, you know, I find

it strange.

The idea is that automatically quota means reducing the standard.

Sure.

Because if you think we're not discriminating, it's true.

But if we are discriminating, it doesn't reduce it.

It makes a more efficient selection.

And most papers in economics, and I think it's fair

enough we take sort of the view that it's not

a moral issue here, but it's taking the view that

it's about, you know, efficiency.

Okay.

So if we treat groups differently then we create some

misallocation starts.

And this is something.

It's not good for them.

Of course by fixing it some people will lose.

It will gain of course.

But in terms of general efficiency, we would like to

make sure that.

We don't have this these types of inefficiency that arise

from discrimination.

Right.

So it fits within.

You.

Know, in most of economic theory we have very little

moral judgement.

And even though, you know, you may not want to

discriminate also for moral reasons, for a lot of this

stuff, immigrants, you don't need to invoke it, because obviously,

unless you think people discriminate because of taste?

That level of people don't get to mix with each

other.

Okay, so if we push that aside, then, uh, most

of the statistical discrimination deals with literature, deals with, uh,

inefficiencies.

If you assume that effort is wasteful, then I guess

increasing the noise.

Can increase efficiency.

People get less effort because you replicate.

I see you guys get the same outcome, right?

Just by adding to the noise.

Um, if you increase the noise, then I can't really

interpret these signals, so I'm learning less in the second

period.

Uh.

But here, it's done in a different way for higher

types of low impact, more tweaking.

And increased noise.

More fine.

Yes.

I need to do it in a way.

Right.

So I need to increase the noise here.

This region.

Yeah.

Right.

I mean, the types of effort that is wasteful, for

example, is that, you know, you go through some tests,

right, to ensure you may study more, but typically this

doesn't really stay with us.

Uh, right.

To study for the grey.

Okay.

Not all the ones that some people study for video.

Uh, but surely, you know it is wasteful.

Um.

So they're actually orthogonal to the literature of discrimination.

There are many papers that look in economics on in,

in theory, economic theory, look at efficient screening or efficient

testing.

How do we design efficient testing.

Uh, and actually very few of these look at discrimination.

So I think that this ability perhaps to.

Combine these two together.

On the quotas, uh, I want to mention sorry.

I was just going to say so on the GL,

for instance, is a good example, right?

Because at the top end there's basically no signal at

all distinguishing people.

You get 168169 whatever.

Yeah.

Whereas in the lower end that's much better around distinguishing.

Yes.

So it's a test that is designed and people work.

Well nobody reduces.

It to the high types.

I mean it's it's it's also costly as you know.

Right.

I mean, there's actual money.

That's another level of discrimination.

So this paper let me mention.

It's mentioned here.

But now I'm thinking it's good to describe it a

bit.

Okay.

So setting so they say okay what you observe is.

Um.

Firms, universities and so on.

They observe some signal that is based on your ability

and on something which they call training.

Okay.

So that's sort of a bit like the gym.

But the training does remain with you in the sense

that it's not wasteful and it does remain you and

it improves your ability.

Okay.

So.

And the the key thing is that what the sorry

what the let's say university to accept you.

What the university says is actually the level of training,

right.

To see that they don't see the total productivity, they

see the gym.

Okay.

And there may be two different types here.

Liability.

Liability.

Okay, but depending on your background, some people are more

privileged.

Some people are less privileged.

So you can go to your life.

This is like the road you travelled.

You can have high training or low training.

Okay.

So a standard acceptance system that observes only this would

favour people with high training.

However, if you take into consideration the fact that this

is something that it is the lack.

And your and actually the productivity satisfies that high type

with low training can still generate a higher output than

a low tech with high training.

Okay.

You may want to have a non monotone, uh.

Cut-Off.

Okay.

So you may want to favour some share of the

people with low training at the expense of those with

whom.

They have a more detailed model showing you how to

do this.

But this is a necessary assumption to guarantee that you

actually want to favour some people with low training.

Right.

So once you recognise that this is not this is

not a clear signal on your productivity, and it's not

correlated with your ability to fully correlate with your ability.

Okay.

Then you may want to use something which for the

outside world would look like lowering your standards or a

quarter or so on.

Right.

But it would be efficient for it.

Okay.

So it has a similar experience.

What we did is just sort of maybe a more

real life example, which, you know, we have these types

of examples, something like.

So it's not exactly great because it does, you know,

it's probably maybe SATs in the US, A-levels here, something

that you go through, you know it does improve.

You know your knowledge.

It does improve your or you are.

Yeah.

It does improve your competence.

Or your ability to be a good student.

I'm afraid that in the for US universities it's probably

too late for these types of papers.

So the the the belief about affirmative action and how

bad it is because actually, you know, reduce the standards

is quite well ingrained in most universities.

So I think in California they stopped affirmative action.

Wasn't it the.

State university's ban.

Last year?

Yeah.

And not just California.

Not just.

Well, yeah.

Supreme court decision.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I mean, it's true that, uh, of course, a lot

of the stuff, depending on how, uh, how this was

implemented in reality.

Okay.

Uh.

So, for example, that papers that show that.

If, uh, if, you know, if you have two separate

goals of academic excellence and diversity is a goal.

Maybe you heard everyone, including the students, that you as

opposed to, you know, efficiency that acknowledges efficiency, consideration that

acknowledges differences in in but in that sort of acknowledges

the road travel distance travelled rather than rather than the

absolute success.

So yeah.

So implementation is important.

Okay, good.

I need the coffee.

Let's take a 20 minutes break.

Okay.

Alex, you wanted to say something?

No.

Very boring.

Thank you so much for setting.

Huh?

Hmm?

Hmm?

Sorry.

Busy day ahead of you.

Today.

Are you.

That's amazing.

That's right.

That's great.

Both the first prize and second prize.

But this.

Is the.

Second time.

Doing, like, first prize in them.

They're doing it with a conjecture.

Uniform distribution?

Yes, but also more than is conjecture.

Like, uh, you assume that the result has the form

k times v square.

And then come the moment you do with the conjecture,

it's very easy and makes me wonder, why didn't we

do it that way?

That's true.

It's actually true.

But.

Okay, I gotta get myself a coffee or anything.

No, no, let's.

You can take that to go.

But sorry, unless you can take this to go, but

otherwise.

It's it's.

In which are you?

A second year piece?

Are you in.

My fourth year, but I mean in marketing and obviously.

Yeah, so I remember.

How are you doing?

Yeah.

Thank you.

Was that fine?

I'm glad this is the last week of lecture.

The last class.

Right?

Yeah.

I was not sure I thought it, but I was

pretty excited.

Yeah, yeah.

No, it is, it is.

Um.

And.

Yeah, I'm.

I mean, I'm enjoying it, but I'm getting tired, like,

I think I need a break, so.

Yeah, I think another test.

Yeah.

I'm also doing macro and public economics.

So quite busy.

Yeah.

Okay.

And then after this, you.

you're.

Nice to me.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, I have the.

Yeah I forgot still going same academic year and that's

gonna be next.

Yeah, yeah.

Are you just taking this term and then next term.

Yeah, I.

Was thinking of but yeah I'm going to be.

Okay.

So.

Okay I'm going to take this down.

Okay.

Are you jealous?

I'm sorry.

What are you.

What the hell?

Yeah.

What?

I've been thinking a couple of classes, images, I mean.

What is your topic?

Political economy.

Uh, yeah.

Yeah, it is in theory.

Speaking theory?

Yeah, yeah.

Political economics.

And you are.

Theory in general, I think.

You also have to have a strategy again.

We have a paper by the end of this year.

But yeah, not a proper The topic for the dissertation.

I see.

So it doesn't have to be one.

The other makes sense.

Yeah.

I also had one recently, but doesn't have to be

my dissertation.

Yeah.

It should be.

Man.

Project.

You're in a box that's going like a top down.

It's like.

A British.

Right?

Yeah, like.

European.

Mhm.

Oh.

Okay, so the last, uh, topic within this, uh.

Part of the course, um.

I want to introduce also the element of segregation.

What we talked about the discrimination or also has some

relation to identity.

Uh, there was a sort of, uh, successful book in

the US called The Big Sort, looking at how segregation

in the US increased a lot on socio economic grounds

and on other grounds.

Uh, were Democrats or Republicans, but.

Um, so and this has seems to be increasing in

recent years.

There are lots of, uh, papers of, uh, looking at

labour market outcomes, inequality and seeing how sort of segregation

is, um, really.

So socioeconomic outcomes is, is a very clear predictor of

segregation and.

Okay.

And what I wanted do.

What I'm going to do is to look at this

type of sort of cycle or relationship.

So we've looked at discrimination resulting from beliefs okay.

And while 1st May ask why are beliefs distorted in

some way.

And segregation could be a way in which we have

different beliefs if we're segregated in different communities.

And it could arise because of two possibilities.

Either the people that have different beliefs segregate.

Okay.

So I believe that, you know, it's very harmful for

my kids to interact with people that are different.

So I segregated, move out to a particular suburb in

which only people like me are there.

Okay.

So that's one possibility, the issue of selection, but another

possibility in which segregation can affect beliefs is that you

interact with.

So you interact in an echo chamber.

Okay.

So um.

And then your beliefs may become even more extreme.

Okay.

So I would say it in the following way.

So people think a lot that echo chambers create distortion

in beliefs and polarisation for echo chambers to do so

we need uh, it cannot be that echo chambers are

composed of distribution of beliefs, which is the same as

the whole population, right?

They already need to be biased in some way.

Okay.

And.

The second condition that we need is that when you

communicate an extreme belief in the echo chamber, you don't

realise that you're encouraging, Right?

So if you do take into consideration the fact that

your echo chamber is consistent.

Select people with particular beliefs.

You're going to take this selection into consideration.

So so two conditions in two heart echo chambers need

to be non-representative.

And people need to suffer from selection bias.

Okay.

And.

And where does segregation creates beliefs.

Because affects beliefs more because of a selection issue that

people select into different neighbourhoods according to their beliefs, or

because they affect each other in their community.

Once they've selected, that's an empirical issue.

It's a bit hard to prove.

Uh, there are a lot of experimental papers or empirical

papers looking at how segregation affects beliefs.

So when you interact, they look at the students, the

chair, dorms and the allocation to dorms is random.

But they show that, you know, before sharing the dorms

with some people, you have particular beliefs about other people,

and then your beliefs improve in general with interaction.

Your beliefs could improve or your beliefs could actually become

worse, depending on the type of interaction that you're going

to have.

Okay, so if you are in a very conflictual environment,

it may be that actually this contact with other people

can make can make it worse.

So that's so there are empirical papers looking at the

effect of segregation of beliefs or less segregation on beliefs.

Uh, and that particular paper showing that also people selected

for different environments.

But it's hard to, to, to actually within one environment,

it's hard to separate these two.

Okay.

So we understand segregation beliefs.

We understand beliefs and discrimination roughly.

Okay.

Uh, so it makes sense that.

You know, we may want to think about all of

these in one model, which is what we want to

do.

Um.

Okay, so I did this.

I talked about the roommates in college.

Right.

So, for example, in the UK, if you look at

the Brexit vote or the general anti-immigration sentiment, it's more

pronounced in areas in which there are knowing, okay, there's

more anti-immigrant sentiment in there.

No immigrants either, because you're not interacting.

With them.

So you can maintain ten bad beliefs without checking.

Without getting any information to the contrary, or you select

to a degree to how much you can select may

depend on your own sub constraints.

Uh.

Okay.

So we talked about selection bias.

Okay.

So the paper I'm going to present is the joint

paper of mine with Rodney.

And the context is the particular context that we talk

about.

But it can be more general or can be applied

to other environment.

Is, is uh, is sort of educational choices, social attitudes

and discrimination in the labour market that stems from whether

people went to a private school or a state.

Okay.

It's the idea that people think.

That, you know, if you went to your to a

private school, your, your productivity is high.

Okay.

One of you did go to a private school.

Don't be targeted.

It's not okay.

Think about this.

Uh, you know, another example which may be more close

to home is, you know, people think that, uh, you

know, Harvard Business School is the best business school to

go to.

And if you go there, that's, you know, um.

And if you go to any other business school, there

is no chance for you to succeed.

Okay.

That's it.

Okay.

So there is some evidence that, uh, you know, you're

going to be very successful if you go to a

private school.

And again, we need to think about, do we attribute

it to real effects of increased productivity or to effects,

other effects that could be potentially networks or lack of

them.

Right.

So that's the that's the issue of beliefs.

Are they if you know they may be correct or

they may be wrong.

Uh, there is some evidence of private school male graduates

are up to 10% more likely to land top jobs

than those that went to state school.

But for example, it works for the Cambridge State School.

Graduates perform better given the same grades that they entered

when they finished the secondary school.

Okay.

And beliefs differ according to.

According to.

Uh.

According to which school actually your kids go to.

Okay.

So in general, people believe that private school pupils are

brighter than the state schools.

Uh, this is a famous paper that shows in the

US that the beliefs of parents about schools is that

And it is delusion that it is not necessarily true.

These beliefs.

So they show how the presence of pupils with high

achievement or the school racial mix have no effect on

other people.

And that and these beliefs differ.

If you send your kids to the state school, you

think that you don't think the difference is that big.

And if you sent your kids to primary school, you

think that it's very big.

Okay.

Which may be the reason why you send your kids

this.

So these beliefs may affect the reason to, uh, segregate

from the rest of the population.

Okay, so amongst that score parent, there was a much

smaller and and among Labour supporters, there was a much

smaller difference compared to conservative or those activities.

Okay.

Okay.

So in the model there are going to be two

schools and uh reliefs are going to be.

So your beliefs about the benefit of the school is

going to affect which school you're going to send your

kids.

So but what will happen in the school?

And again, if you think about Harvard Business School, what

happens often in these places is that when people are

there, they also become very proud of their own institutions

and they sort of facilitate this piece.

Okay, so you think about what I'm going to think

about when you interact.

This is sort of the equivalent to interacting in this

echo chamber.

I'm going to strengthen my belief that, uh, or I'm

going to be affected by the beliefs of the other

people there with a selection bias.

Okay.

So there's going to be first, segregation according to beliefs,

and then there's going to be.

Um.

Sort of exchange of beliefs in this aggregated environment with

selection bias.

So the beliefs can be strengthened or depending on who's

coming.

So depending on the segregation, if it is done indeed

according to belief.

So maybe it represents the water pollution.

Okay.

Then we're going to look at sort of labour market.

So that's sort of going to be the discrimination element.

So school school graduates are going to make employment decision.

And in the labour market you're going to get two

signals about the ability of the people that you hire.

Okay.

And it's going to be.

Okay.

And and it's going to be a dynamic model in

which individuals transmit their beliefs to offsprings and also decide

on which school to send your child to.

Okay.

And this decision is going to be based on what

we call in sort of models of cultural transmission of

values, preferences.

It's going to be done using partial empathy.

What is the partial empathy?

I care about my child, but I use my own

beliefs of values to think what would be good for

them.

Okay.

Full empathy is to actually use their preferences, right?

So I put weight in my utility.

I only care, you know, if I think about the

future, I only think about my children.

Let's say I put even zero weight on my own.

But I evaluate the future possibilities of my child according

to my beliefs.

Okay.

Another example rather than private or state, you can think

about parents thinking about sending their child to a religious

school versus a secular school, right?

So they can foresee that when they send them to

a religious school, their beliefs might be moved in some

direction.

And the evaluating according to what they think.

You know, their view of the world.

Okay.

So you expect more religious parents to send their kids

to school?

Uh.

But again, expecting that the beliefs of the kids in

the school would be affected by what they start in

school.

Okay, so a school sort of fulfils two roles in

the model.

The people that you interact with in the school are

going to affect your own beliefs about, you know, how

good the school is.

So we get this pride in whatever environment we have,

and it's going to affect what other people think about

you.

Okay.

Because there is a tag on you and you go

to the labour market with this particular time.

Again, maybe it's easy to think about universities in this

environment.

Okay, so how is the exchange of beliefs going to

work once you in a particular environment we are going

to, you know, just exchange our beliefs about how beneficial

it is to be in our school compared to the

other, but we're going to ignore the fact that we

observe a biased sample.

Okay.

And there's going to be in the model some tension

between potential tension, if indeed, you know, schools create different

echo chambers, then the beliefs that you see around you

may create some different beliefs according to the school that

you went to.

And if the beliefs are Exaggerated.

Okay, then there's going to be some true learning from

the labour market.

And that may push your beliefs to have, uh, to

think about the load difference between these, these two types

of education system.

Okay.

So let me describe the model.

Uh, I'm going to have a continuum of dynasties.

And I'm going to follow the belief of each dynasty.

Okay.

So each dynasty, you have one individual at any period.

So there's going to be discrete time.

I'm going to have one interview at any period.

Not overlapping generations, just one individual.

And at the end of this period this individual is

replaced by.

One offspring.

So each dynasty holds a beliefs about the productivity of

state versus private school, uh, graduate, and at any period

individuals participate at three stages.

So they go to school.

In the school they may change their beliefs.

Then they go to the labour market.

They may change the beliefs, and then they need to

decide for the offspring in the next period which school

they send into.

Okay, so as I said, there are two schools and

I'm going to assume that everyone knows that the productivity

of private school graduates is one.

Okay.

Sorry.

But you differ.

So we start with different trials okay.

So you have a belief that the productivity of state

school graduates is one with some probability shift and zero.

Okay.

So you're going to have an average belief of state

school to be quite okay.

So essentially dynasties, you know in the initial stage dynasties

just have you can start from a continuous distribution on

the line.

So Q at time zero.

Okay.

Is somewhere between zero.

Okay.

So qi is the original belief of dynasty.

I'm going to assume just for the purpose of today,

I'm going to assume that the actual productivity of state

schools is exactly the same.

But even if you assume it's below, for example, what

you will get in this model is potentially that the

difference is exacerbating.

Okay, so assuming it's the same, it doesn't matter.

Okay.

So I'm going to assume that robot activity is also

one.

But people have differences in their beliefs.

Start with differences, the beliefs about the activity.

So I'm going to start with full support distribution of

the beliefs on zero one.

Okay this I said that for simplicity the productivity also

in the States.

Okay.

Another simplifying assumption.

If you go to the state school, no matter what

belief you came with, you learn that the productivity is

one.

So you understand the productivity.

So sort of you experience the environment in which people

may have the wrong beliefs and you learn the truth.

Okay.

So I'm just going to follow one equation okay.

For simplicity it's quite hard to to think about both

okay.

So I'm going to follow about the private school echo

chamber.

And it will be an echo chamber if there would

be a particular selection of people going there.

So in the private schools, what you're going to do

is sort of randomly interact and exchange information with other

individuals.

So if you come if your parents endowed you with

some believe key key, you're going to exchange this information

with your friends, okay.

And so your belief when you graduate, it's going to

be a function of your own belief and that of

your friends okay.

Okay.

And I'm going to assume.

This particular function okay.

Which.

Essentially can be uh I don't want to get into

that.

But this is this this is sort of a rational

way to update your beliefs when your beliefs are independent.

Okay?

And it ignores the selection bias.

Okay.

And it has.

Okay.

And it has a very clear features of um.

For example, you know, if if I have belief zero,

I will never change my mind and I will change

the mind of everyone that I interact with, I will

push them to zero.

Similarly, if I have one that will be super convincing

and if everyone has beliefs below or half.

Okay, so everyone that interacts are here, they will be

pushed towards zero and the other way around.

So there is an element of polarisation With this function

that, you know, we move to we move to the

extreme.

Okay.

Right.

So the state of the world here could be either

1 or 0.

The productivity.

And this is the belief that the state is one.

The more I see people that think that the state

is one, the more I move in this direction, the

more I see people that think, the more I move.

But I don't take into consideration the fact that this

is a selected sample in the population.

Okay, so then you enter, you graduate okay.

And your cohort is the entire employment.

Okay.

So there are no older people or younger people And

you become an employer with some probability, an employee otherwise.

And employers and employees are matched randomly, and the employer

is the one that decides whether to employ.

So imagine I'm drawing a wage.

Okay, I'm drawing a wage.

And then and then I'm thinking, so wait, I'm drawing

randomly a wage for the match.

And then I'm thinking, well, I've, I matched with someone

from that private school.

The wage is going to be between 0 and 1.

The productivity of the private school is one.

So I always employ them.

Okay.

But if I'm matched with someone from a state school,

the productivity is somewhere here.

According to my belief, I'm not always going to draw,

so that will capture discrimination.

If the beliefs are sustained.

Okay.

The beliefs are sustained to be less than one.

Then that would create a discrimination in the labour market

in the long term.

What I want to see is what happens in the

long term.

And not, by the way, that an employer here is

losing from the fact that she's discriminated because she's matched

once, and if she's not employing someone that actually has

a higher productivity wage.

She is making the wrong decision.

So there would be that, okay.

And then when you do match someone, you will get

a signal about their time, about their productivity.

So this signal could potentially outweigh what happens in the

echo chamber in the next in the next period okay.

So we have beliefs that are going to influence higher

decision.

Wrong beliefs can imply wrong decision as an employer.

Okay.

If you employed a state school graduate, if your self

you are a state school graduate, you have released one.

So you're not going to change your beliefs.

But if you potentially don't have beliefs, one again, this

will have to check.

In equilibrium.

You receive a signal about his productivity being one with

some precision.

So you're going to move to move towards the truth

okay, so the labour market experience will always move it

along towards the truth okay.

And children are going to inherit their parents beliefs.

And parents decide when to send the child to.

So using partial empathy to compute the future benefit of

their own offspring.

Okay.

So now I'm going to compute.

That's the key element of the paper.

So the first element that we need to compute.

So think about, uh, the beginning.

I need to think where to send my child to.

So I'm computing the benefit of your child from attending

a private school as perceived by myself.

Okay, so that's the delta t, so we some probability

the offspring may become an employee and be matched with

a private school employer.

In that case, she's better off going to the private

school because.

She would.

Be employed more often.

So that's a relative benefit from attending a private school.

Is the average wage that you will get as a

private school graduate.

So the average is going to be a half because

you will.

So let's say this is uniform.

She will always be employed.

Okay.

So average would be.

But if she is a state school graduate.

Okay.

Then maybe potentially some people have other beliefs.

Some people are not going to employ her.

So her wage average.

Wage is going to be there.

That's a benefit that does not partially that is not

relevant to you because the benefit does not depend on

the parent's beliefs.

That is the reason for everyone.

Right.

So think about this for a second.

More generally, if I think that that some people are

discriminated against, I don't want to belong to this.

Right.

Okay.

So that's not related to yes right or wrong beliefs.

That's just an equilibrium reaction.

If there is discrimination against one particular behaviour or attitude

okay.

So parents are telling their kids don't don't put the

tools on because you will get lower wage in the

labour market.

Does doesn't depend on my belief whether People to discriminate

or not against people.

Yeah.

So this is the first that should make everyone want

to send their kids to it.

So the private school.

Yeah.

But the offspring may become an employer.

And if she is met with a private school, it

doesn't matter which school she went to.

Yeah, because everyone has the correct values.

But if she's matched, okay, if she's matched with a

state school.

So if you become an employer who's matched with the

state school, then where you went to school is going

to affect on whether you employ this person.

Okay.

So this is where partial empathy comes into play and

where sort of homophily is going to be created.

Imagine I'm a parent that has a very bad view

about.

The.

School.

I'm thinking what I would like my kids to do

is not to have a state school.

Okay.

So what I need to make sure is that I

centre to an environment in which everyone thinks roughly like

me, which is possible, but depends on the endogenous network

that is created in the room by other parents.

Okay.

I would like my head to be essentially to maintain

my beliefs.

That would be the best one, right?

Okay.

Because I'm using my beliefs to evaluate.

So I'm looking at the environment that would best maintain

my beliefs.

So if the private school would include, you know, people

with beliefs here, that's much better for me than sending

her to the state school where she would get beliefs

one.

I'm assuming this right.

Okay.

Uh, so it's sort of a endogenous equilibrium action of

all parents together sort of to create this particular network.

So I think how I view the profit of my

offspring as an employer, which, you know, someone.

Who's estate school.

Uh, depends on that, depends on my on my beliefs

and on who else goes to the prompt.

Okay.

Again, maybe the example of religion.

You know, if I think that when I'm if I'm

religious and I send my son to a state school

and he will become secular or sorry, to secular school,

and I'm thinking, okay, it's not going to act in

a way, it's not going to participate in rituals.

It's not going to pray.

He will be punished.

Okay.

Uh, so it's the same idea.

So I take my own beliefs.

And I.

And I'm thinking how my child's beliefs would change in

that environment and how it will affect their action.

That's the key thing.

It's the actions that give you the anxiety these actions

are evaluated with.

My beliefs is my own beliefs.

Okay, so this is the part of the difference.

So actually if you have beliefs that right, that state

schools are quite good, you're really worried about your kid

going to an environment to make their beliefs very low

about them because they will miss opportunities to hire.

Okay.

So it's about how the beliefs will affect their actions.

And I and that's why I want them in general

to maintain as much as possible beliefs like like mine.

Okay.

So so the partial empathy creates great homophily.

Okay.

So this is just putting these two elements together.

This is the probability that you become employer, uh, and

you are matched with a state school graduate.

And this is the probability you become an employee in

your match with a private school employer.

Okay.

So you.

Don't think too much about throwing gamma and just putting

these two things together.

Just remember this.

This is the element that is relevant for the beliefs.

Okay.

And this is an assumption about sort of how the

market works.

Sort of the private school has some capacity role.

And the private school is going to admit, uh, the

share of the individuals with the largest benefit from entering

the private school.

So this is like a willingness to pay.

Okay.

So I don't want to get into prices and stuff

like this.

What will happen in this environment is that if, you

know, if it would work in the long term, that

we will maintain segregation and discrimination.

It's beneficial for entrepreneurs to create this segregation possibility.

Okay.

They can make money out of this.

Again, I think you can see it with many applications

just.

Okay.

And this is the key result.

Uh.

The key results.

Suppose that we started.

So the map is going to be created.

Let's say that we start I'm just.

Starting with all these parents sending their kids to the

private school and everyone else sending the kids to the

state.

And the result says if.

Okay, so if this Cut-Off is sufficiently low.

Okay.

This is Q over.

The share of people here is wrong.

If this Cut-Off Q is sufficiently low, then I can

sustain long term segregation and discrimination.

Otherwise It will.

At some point it will explode and people will sort

of land it.

Okay, so first, just some basic understanding.

P remember, it's the precision of signal that you get

in the labour market.

So that works towards knowing the truth.

Q Upper Bar is this Cut-Off and is the sort

of how much interaction there is.

So the force of the influence in the school.

Okay.

You know, maybe it's also the force of the ethos

of the school, the parents, the priests, whatever.

Okay.

So this is sort of captures the interaction in the

segregated environment.

And this captures the interaction, the non-significant.

Okay.

And not surprisingly here what you need is the interaction

in the segregated environment to be strong enough towards zero

compared to the interaction in the non segregated environment.

And if initially it is strong enough, then we can

guarantee that the leaves are always going to move in

this direction.

In this dynasties that started going to the private school

okay.

So they always stay.

This dynasties always stay in the private school.

And what happens in the long term, in the long

term, beliefs must go to zero.

Okay.

So this Cut-Off is determined in the following way.

Take this dynasty.

Make her interact.

Make the person here interact with n minus one other

people that are like her.

Okay, so then her beliefs, you know, may go down

Q up a bar is less than a half.

Okay, I believe it's going to go down because she

sees other people that have also believed that the state

school is relatively good activity.

Then she goes to the market.

Worst case scenario for the private school, she interacts with

the state school.

She matched with state school and hires her.

Okay, so the wage is low enough, but then she

gets a truth signal.

If now she gets the true signal and P such

that she updates her belief and she goes up, but

she doesn't cross this Q.

Okay, she goes up worst case, to the point that

she started with.

Then I can guarantee that there will always be.

A movement.

So everyone else will move.

Okay, so she will, you know, these people become smaller

and smaller, insure everyone else because they interact with people

whose beliefs is less than a half for sure will

go down and in the limit will go down.

So if the parents here initially prefer to send their

kids or have the highest, now we need to.

For this to work, we need to look at the

the the fact that initially knowing that all these people

are going to go to.

School.

And all these.

People out.

There, that it has to be that this parent prefers,

right, prefers to send her.

Kids.

To the private school on average, she knows that maybe

the beliefs are not going.

She's not going to interact only with people like her.

Right.

So she has to think about the beliefs.

So it has to be that these parents are happy

about doing this.

And this homophily point guarantees that they prefer to go

here rather than get beliefs one.

Okay.

Now.

What happens if.

It's not the.

What happens if you know the original Q upper bar

is slightly higher?

Okay.

The condition was sufficient and necessary.

So the point is to say now that if the

Q upper very slightly higher than the Q upper bar,

that after an interaction and getting a signal in the

labour market remains the same.

So if it's slightly higher than that this breaks down.

Okay.

So how does it break down.

If q upper bar is slightly higher, there is always

going to be a measure of people such that after

they interact with people here, get a signal in the

labour market, are going to actually increase their belief.

Right?

Because up above is the point in which you end

up exactly with your belief.

So above Q bar, there's always going to be a

measure of small and become smaller, but there's always going

to be a strictly positive measure of individuals that is

sort of going to move their beliefs.

Okay.

And now the the next point, it's quite a theoretical

construct, but I think it does ring.

There is some truth to it.

Okay.

At some point it's going to be the case that

their willingness to pay for this school includes a lot

of people that are actually moving in this direction.

So they believe so Their willingness to pay for the

private school is actually going to be lower than someone

with beliefs for.

Okay.

Someone with beliefs.

One that has been sold to a state school.

Is not worried that if they send the kids to

private school, the beliefs of the kids will change because

they endowed them with stronger speech.

Okay, this is a bit like I think the religious

example may be better.

Super essay parents that are not worried that their kids

is going to become religious.

Or if you are, you know, if you are, maybe

if you are a Protestant and you're thinking about sending

your kid to Catholic school, you're a bit worried because

quite similar.

So the beliefs may go in this direction, but if

you're a Jewish or Muslim, you think, I don't mind.

The kid is not going to.

Write.

So you are sufficiently different that you don't think the

beliefs will change.

So you're not worried about the labour market outcome of

your kid as an employer?

You don't think they will make the wrong decisions because

you're giving them the strong beliefs of one.

And you're thinking, actually, I can benefit from the positive

discrimination that my kid will get at the private school.

Okay, so that means that someone with beliefs one is

actually going to have stronger willingness to pay than this

person that is worried more about it.

Okay.

Okay.

And at that point they will form a share part

of the share of those with the highest.

Okay.

Okay.

So they'll enter the school and they will contaminate the

beliefs.

That part I think is a bit less realistic, but

theoretically that's that's the idea.

They will contaminate the beliefs and this will unravel.

Okay, so this is why it's sort of a necessary

and sufficient condition.

I think theoretically, you know, in practice, I mean, I

don't think there are enough people coming to contaminate beliefs.

But we do see, if you if you think about

the application to schools, we do see, um, so for

example, private schools and religious schools, they go and private

schools do interview even when your kid is like 6

or 7, they do or 12 they do interviews with

the parents.

Okay.

Also, uh, religious schools go to the parents home admission.

Uh, they do check admission.

They actually go to the kids home.

If you think about, uh, legacy hiring decisions done by

Harvard, for example, you know, there are.

And the fact that they, you know, uh.

Sort of they make sure that sort of the right

people enter.

Okay.

So, you know, of course this is an exaggeration, but

but there are a lot of practices of entry, okay?

There are a lot of practices of entry in which,

you know, sort of school selectivity and the role of

interviews allows also to get the people with the right

beliefs into the environment, uh, to make sure that, uh,

that you maintain this.

Okay.

So then we look at different sort of anti-discrimination policies.

So if you make sure that, you know, you have

to hire with a higher probability everyone that you meet,

for example, then you're going to get more true signals.

Integration in schools should, you know, make sure that you

have people with different beliefs.

So that's going to have some effect on beliefs and

long term outcome.

Um.

There are many types of, uh, discrimination practices by firms

that, of course, you know, so there is stuff that

they're not allowed to discriminate on anymore.

Okay.

So you're not allowed to discriminate the black worker compared

to a white worker.

But when this was decided by the Supreme Court, a

lot of times what they did is to base the

discrimination on things like, uh, so you you're trying for

a job, and the job suddenly demands also a high

school diploma.

Okay.

It's correlated with the socio economic ground and the background,

and potentially the US race is a big predictor of

that.

So even if the job doesn't, doesn't really need the

high school diploma.

So it's a very basic job okay.

This is serves as a way to discriminate.

So a lot of observable of uh, if you shut

down discrimination on one thing, discrimination can arise on other

characteristics that, uh, that are observable.

And uh, and then and then you create the beliefs,

right?

That for this particular job it's very important to get

to high school.

Okay.

So there is like a difference in ability for this

particular job between those that go to high school, those

that don't go to us, but it's actually a job

that does not mean this particular thing.

So your productivity will be the same, but you somehow

create the belief that it's better.

Okay.

But I think from the point of the bigger topic

of, uh, you know, segregation and wrong beliefs, I think

it's important to look at these endogenous networks rather than

just assume that people are, in general, in order to

make sure that.

The different beliefs arise.

So to order the decisions.

So.

It's not that here it's done in an ideal way,

but to model the equilibrium decision of who to be

in the network with respect that I want to be.

Uh.

I want to be to live in some particular area

around people that are similar to me, but it depends

on who else is more.

Of an.

Equilibrium.

To that, because that's all including like heritability of productivity.

So increasing.

Have you introduce uh, like a heritability of productivity.

Heritability right.

So persistence in the product.

Right.

So we have a section in which we extend to

think about different activities.

Just to show us not just instead of, you know

one here but it is it doesn't matter less than

one.

You still get exaggeration of the difference.

Uh.

So for this to be interesting, you want to start

with an image with a difference.

And then.

You need to think about how innate activity interacts with

what is cool.

So not in this context.

So the so busy and filled year.

But remember the year.

From the early 2000.

So they have papers on cultural transmission of preferences.

Okay.

This is not about inherited traits but the parent can

invest in some traits.

Okay.

Let's say religious beliefs or ideas about religion culture okay.

Uh, but they also know there's going to be this

effect on society.

Okay.

So of course, they take into consideration the effect of

society to think about how much they need to invest,

and if they live in a society in which there

are different for them, they need to invest a lot

in order to counteract it.

So you can see why also homophily is created here.

And again, they also use this for the, uh, partially.

Okay.

So uh, if you also have, you know, traits that

could be inherited, then you need to invest less.

Okay.

So if I'm super productive and my kid inherited inherits

that, I don't need to invest as much in their

productivity.

Although often we see the opposite.

The more sort of competent, able and productive are super

more worried about the children.

Invest more.

Yeah.

Or even.

Right.

If you have less, if you are less productive, you

have less resources to invest in.

Cognitive.

Model.

Yeah.

But I think you can see this role for, for

entrepreneurs that if there are initially some differences in beliefs

or if you can create some differences of beliefs, I

can extract some resources from individuals that would pay for

an environment in which they can, you know, achieve this

game.

So can we talk about side economics?

People talk a lot about structural.

Discrimination.

For example, particular structures in society that exist in facilitators.

Okay, so one potential possibility here in this, uh, environment

is to think about the role of entrepreneurs and the

role of different interview procedures and stuff like this is

maintaining discrimination.

So the non structural discrimination here will just be that,

okay I meet someone in the labour market and I

think that you have them.

So I don't hire them okay.

But this is sustained by a structure that allows me

to maintain these particular beliefs and to and and.

Of course, a structure that allows me to discriminate according

to the CV and so on, but a legal structure,

then I'm going to do it.

And here a structure that allows me to, in the

long term, maintain this belief, uh, because somebody can benefit

from it and, and allows me to use procedures such

as interviews.

And not, not look, only, let's say, the child, but

also the family, okay?

Stuff like that.

Yeah.

I was just wondering, general, because it has like different

steps in this model, but it was worth thinking of.

Some political preferences because also like the motivation of these

is like the UK for example, like most of the

people are going to be government officials.

Private school.

Yeah.

I was just wondering, like there's a step here, like

many of these people who attend private schools are going

to become government officials and potentially preserving this political preference

of the yes country.

Yeah.

So.

Right.

Because right now it's just labour market, right?

Well in school it's called market.

And labour market is like the key.

Yeah.

So I mean.

You know, I made this assumption here that everyone.

Has the same.

Income.

I didn't really look into.

And so potentially the high willingness to pay for the

schools, they can also pay income tax.

Okay.

But of course, you know, you could you because they

are discriminated in the market.

Some people have higher income than others or maybe also

and all these other worlds.

And so maybe they're not very.

And so you know, this trick that these people contaminate

the system is not easy.

Okay.

And so if people also because of this labour market

outcome have.

Been maintaining the income differences.

Right.

Um.

Because I have to eat.

Discrimination is related with political preferences.

Is it's correlated right?

In many aspects.

Right.

Who are more to the right prefer not or.

I mean, we discussed.

This a lot, right?

I mean, how did these conventions fit together and whether

it's how endogenous.

It.

Is and sometimes, um.

So there is a very good idea.

Um.

So the one and seven that both the government department

and, and they show how sort of politicians just use

discrimination to their benefits.

It's.

In the following way.

So they make salient, uh.

Something that creates, for example, you know, suddenly we decide

that women are not allowed to work.

Okay.

So we create this issue and that sort of, you

know, creates and in the decentralised world.

Creates.

Discrimination.

And this discrimination allows some people to extract resources at

the benefit of others.

Right.

Once you discriminate, you have environmental glory.

Some people and some people you know benefit more than

others.

So for some group it's beneficial.

I mean, if discrimination is above different resources, right, which

I think you know.

Okay.

Uh, it can be other stuff as well, but.

It.

Has economic implications.

I think that's.

Also the point of the economic.

Application.

Uh.

It's not just.

You know, I don't want to be frank.

It has real implications on the market.

And so and so it means that some groups can

benefit from the expense of others.

And then it's worthwhile for this group to also choose

a politician that we guarantee them.

This time.

So I agree in this paper.

The model is complicated enough.

So there is no politics here, but I don't think

we have a lot of paper.

Discrimination as a as a as a political Magical tool.

And also maybe part of structure.

But again, we discussed this.

I think I said several times, like, you know, if

you think about the women writing the rights, I mean,

they have huge implications for ability to participate.

So if they're not someone else.

Or if you keep some population, uh, you know, relatively

low education or low income, they're going to end up

with, uh, you know, just working.

And that's very social.

I saw a couple of months ago, I saw the

paper about, uh.

So people are trying to explain the division between North

Italy, Successful ridge and South Korea.

So even after unification, there's still different economic outcomes.

And.

Uh, so there are explanations to try to show that

the North extracted resources from the South and that we

should try to show this.

But just saying, ah, is the culture of the southern

people is not working for possible explanation successful.

But this explanation was relying on the fact that, uh,

in the South there were more company companies or agricultural,

but because of the culture, they were more of a

nuisance.

Okay.

And they really kept the education level at most at

primary education.

That means that they could really pay your wages.

Just really.

Very.

Other.

Very little items.

Well, if you have knowledge and after unification there were

there was a lot that said everyone.

Could see them.

You know, some people in the village.

But it was nothing like that.

So there are I think there are a lot of

things at play.

And.

And I think it's also.

It's not the most of the time.

It's not the one person groups intention to do something.

So something evolves, evolves and gets stuck in a situation,

it is easy to maintain what.

We can see from the way people are justifying how

they extract resources.

I don't justify it by saying, oh, we want to

extract these resources, right?

We feel that they have to justify it by other

ways.

They justify by releasing.

Back.

The way people justified slavery.

More in ways of, you know, demonising the other group

and doing it in a way that.

I'm not saying we are racist or not saying, oh,

let's extract resources.

Right?

Never declared in this way.

But there is a typically system of beliefs in the

background that is maintained somehow.

People are lazy or competency, and this system of beliefs

is also helpful for creating structures and is maintained by

the structures, I think.

And yes, I wanted to somehow put politics there and

show when is it also sustained by the political system

and when does it break down?

So the political system was part of changing a civil

rights movement.

Part of it the decline of the judicial system.

But some things seem to be going backward.

And so I think it's a big challenge now for

political economy, because it's exactly all this sort of populist

movement of today right next to all this old school.

It's just.

Okay, let's get depressed.

You.

I want to continue next time on.

Joe.

What is next time?

So if that guy is doing sort of macro political

economy, I think macro is only in name in the

sense it's going to be for the more dynamic models

of decision making and.

Legislative.

Macro and the element of, you know, increasing the budget

and creating debt.

Uh.

So I'm thinking about this stuff and I think it's

doing great work.

Um, and then Valentina from the government department is a

classical political economist and trying to talk about what the

media.

Media, don't want me to.

Go.

Don't do that.

Okay.

Okay.

It was really nice to share.

And if you want to talk about ideas.

All right.

A good break.

When we find out about coursework and things.

So it should be published in a week.

Okay.

So I think that the slides that from before this

one.

So the one about, uh, why do people vote?

I couldn't find it on YouTube.

Okay.

Yeah.

Thanks for that.

So the one, uh, information.

Yes.

It was, uh.

The first time for this kind of people converting stuff

or something.

Okay, this one here.

Okay.

Okay.

Thank you.
