ABSTRACT
During the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Selanik became one of
most modernised and dynamic regions of the Ottoman Empire. With its tightly knit
marketing networks and extensive railway systems, relatively well-developed financial
markets, fluid land market, modem factories, burgeoning urban areas and port-cities,
Selanik had clearly become one of the leading commercial regions of the entire eastern
Mediterranean basin by the*turn o f the twentieth century. Two primary forces underlay
the process o f economic modernisation in the region, namely the capitalist world
economy and the reform efforts of the Ottoman government. Enhanced integration with
the world economy brought new opportunities and helped bolster economic
modernisation in the region. The reform efforts and infrastructure investments of the
Ottoman state also contributed to the moment of commercialisation and modernisation.
Notwithstanding the impressive dynamism and apparent modernisation of the
regional economy, serious processes of retardation and backwardness also surfaced
rather strongly during the same period. Ironically, the very same forces that generated
much dynamism in the regional economy also prepared the structural ground for
retardation and backwardness. More specifically, the growing moment of
commercialisation and enhanced integration with the world capitalist economy created
serious dislocations in the agrarian economy and prepared ground for economic
retardation. Likewise, the organisational, fiscal and diplomatic weakness of the Ottoman
government undermined the existing potential for economic development and growth.
Thus, a dual economic structure emerged whereby facets of “modernity” and
growth meshed with those of economic retardation and backwardness. The socio
economic tensions and contradictions building up in this process prepared the structural
background to the dissolution and eventual collapse o f the Ottoman rule in the Balkans.
In other words, the sporadic fits o f modernity and growth could not be sustained, given
the overwhelming dominance of European economic interests and the apparent,
weakness of the Ottoman state. The conflict ridden transformation process simply
erupted in uprising, revolution and war.


The fear o f loneliness has been like a ball and chain restraining ambition, as much o f an obstacle to a fu ll life as persecution, discrimination or poverty. Until the chain is broken, freedom, fo r many, will remain a nightmare

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
Over the past six years, many people put much effort, care and trust into this
study.
I would like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Peter Howlett, for all the support and
guidance he has given me since my early M.Sc. days at the LSE. Peter read virtually
everything I wrote during the course of research and made key comments that helped
improve the clarity and consistency o f my arguments. Without his criticisms and
insight, this thesis would have been prone to serious weaknesses.
Mere acknowledgement cannot express the debt I owe Professor Engin D.
Akarli of Brown University, who was a constant source of support, encouragement and
inspiration. I was fortunate enough to benefit from his in-depth knowledge of theoretical
issues and his vast experience in Ottoman studies. His advice gave me direction and
perspective at seemingly impossible moments.
I would also like to thank the many other distinguished academics who
contributed, in different ways, to the current study. Professor Donald Quataert and Dr.
Oktar Ttirel read the early drafts o f the thesis and made useful comments, which helped
me formulate the broad conceptual and historical framework o f the thesis.
Dr. Halil Berktay, Professor §evket Pamuk and Professor Zafer Toprak
generously gave me the much needed financial support and professional guidance
during my term o f tenure at the Ataturk Institute o f Modem Turkish History at Bogazi9i
University in Istanbul during 1995/1996.
I would also like to thank the staff of British Library of Political and Economic
Sciences, SOAS library, British Library, Bogazi9 i University Library, Public Record
Office, Prime Ministry Archives in Istanbul, Hakki Tank Uz Library, Ataturk
Kiituphanesi, and the French Institute of Anatolian Studies for their help and
cooperation during my research.


Without the unfaltering support, love and trust of my parents all this would have
been impossible. I cannot possibly thank them for their kindness, care and sacrifice. In
gratitude, I dedicate the current thesis to them.
I would also like to mention the contribution of my grandfather, Haydar Ilgar, to
the current thesis. Notwithstanding the burden of his faltering health, he energetically
introduced me to the intricacies o f the Ottoman script and helped me make sense of
abstruse Ottoman documents, an effort which I acknowledge in gratitude.
I shared truly special moments with a few friends, who I must recall in
thankfulness. Rosi proved me that bananas could actually be fried in butter; Raul helped
me acquire an exquisite taste in different varieties of Mexican chillies, for breakfast;
Heidi kept losing in our endless card games, much to my ultimate satisfaction; Tatjana
graciously hosted me in a spooky house that was apparently haunted by the spirit of old
witches; and, Stefan convinced me that Mediterranean manners and the romantic poetry
of Lord Byron are indeed compatible, and when combined appropriately they can help
make sense o f one’s strange existence in tiny London flats, especially in claustrophobic
kitchens. I thank all these people for their love, care and kind support.
I would like to thank my wife Hiilya for her unfaltering support and trust. With
her sharp sense o f humour, patience, love, and intellectual wit she helped me get
through difficult times with ease and enhanced confidence. I remain truly grateful for all
she has done for me.
Finally, I would like to thank all those who have contributed to this study, and
whom I may have inadvertently but rudely forgotten to name.

INTRODUCTION
1. The Problem:
Contemporary Near Eastern economies face serious economic problems.
Endemic poverty, twisted income distribution, inadequate health and educational
services, environmental problems, and resource depletion affect the region in varying
degrees of urgency.1 These economic problems undermine the quality of life in the
region and put the vast majority of its people under acute and constant economic
distress. In retrospect, this poor state of economic affairs may appear to have been th e.
destiny o f the region. The persistent failure of the modernisation efforts in the region is
striking. Modernisation efforts have yielded important results, and underscored the
irreversible transformation of these economies towards a more industrialised and urban
based structure since the e.arly decades o f the nineteenth century. Egypt under Mehmet
Ali during 1805-1845, the Hamidian and Unionist years o f the Ottoman Empire, early
decades of Republican Turkey, the first few decades of the post-war communist regimes
in the Balkans, the import substituting industrialisation drive o f the 1960s and the
1970s, and the moment of economic liberalisation during the 1980s and the 1990s
constitute some of the important landmarks in this long process.2 Still, the region

appears to have failed to break through the predicament of poverty. The modernisation
drive of especially the last thirty years, particularly in the Balkans and increasingly in
Turkey, also came at a severe environmental cost, which puts a heavy burden not only
on current generations but also on future ones. Overall, the project of “modernisation”,
which initially promised prosperity as well as greater equality for all, appears betrayed.
in the region.3
The poor state of Near Eastern economies has strongly shaped the way in which
the economic history of the region has been written over the last four decades.
Economic historians attempted to trace back certain structural factors, and processes
that have underscored the persistence o f underdevelopment in the region. This is an
effort that is politically and academically justifiable. The effort is politically justifiable
for it attempts to understand and explain the historical reasons underlining the
persistence of human suffering and insecurity, notwithstanding the great technological
achievements o f our era and the economic potential o f the region. An effort to explain
‘what went wrong’ in the Near East may provide us with a better insight in dealing with
problems of the region.
Earlier efforts to deal with problems of economic development in the Near East
suffered from certain historiographical flaws. For one, nationalist worldviews and
suppositions, which have had a strong influence on the historiography of the Near East,
affect our perceptions and interpretations of historical events and processes in peculiar
ways.4 That these perceptions and interpretations have become deeply entrenched in our

minds through public education and other popular means, blinds many to alternative
visions and approaches.5 For instance, until recently, there has been an apparent lack of
serious interest in the Ottoman period of Balkan economic history. Many standard texts,
including those of Lampe and Jackson and Berend and Ranki, offer categorical
judgements without serious research or reflection.6 Typically, they could argue that
Ottoman despotism was the primary factor that undermined the developmental potential
o f the Balkan economies. The implication of this position is that, in an ideal world, that
is a world without the exacting oriental despotism o f the Ottomans, the Balkan
economies would have successfully gone through the necessary stages of social and
economic development that eventually, and inevitably, led to industrial capitalism. They
would have potentially broken through the predicament of underdevelopment long
before the establishment o f the communist regimes in the region. Thus, the mainstream
scholarship in Balkan economic history has defined the Ottoman past as the “other” in
its nationalist imagination,' identifying it as the source of persistent backwardness in the
region.7
A similar problem in dealing with the Ottoman past also surfaces quite strongly
in nationalist Turkish historiography. In works of this genre, the economic history of the
Ottoman Empire is treated as a process of steady decline and retreat since its “classical

age” in the sixteenth century. Post-classical Ottoman economic history ends in full
blown financial and economic dependency and loss of national sovereignty. The
degeneration of the “classical” Ottoman institutions leads to the weakening of the
central authority.8 Unable to control the provinces and collect the taxes, the central
government runs into serious fiscal problems. The' monetary regime becomes
destabilised leading to inflation and gradual economic decline.9 Simultaneously, ever
intensifying European competition in international and domestic markets, and the heavy
burden of constant warfare on Ottoman state finances, further intensifies the problems
of the Ottoman economy.10 Thus, by the end of the nineteenth century the Ottoman
economy enters the path o f semi-colonisation. Only after the establishment of the
sovereign republican regime in the 1920s does the economy recover sufficiently to
make the desired breakthrough.11 Thus, once again, the Ottoman past emerges as the
negation, or rather the anti-thesis of ‘modernity’, which is considered to be the
exclusive attribute o f the republican era.
The problems of the Ottoman economy had become certainly grave and far
reaching by the last quarter of the eighteenth century. Fiscal insolvency, monetary
instability, and inflationary pressures were among the problems that affected the
Ottoman economy and economic policy makers.12 However, seeing the roots o f these
problems in a steady and sustained economic decline that lasted for over three centuries

is not persuasive. First, the historical evidence presented in support of this view is far
from conclusive, because it is based on selectively used sources and tentative
interpretations. Secondly, recent research indicates that the Ottoman economy showed
signs o f significant dynamism and growth. For instance, we now realise that in the first
half of the eighteenth century the Ottoman economy could well have been much more
dynamic and robust than what the steady decline thesis would suggest. Likewise,
research by distinguished scholars such as Eldem, Issawi, Kurmu§, Pamuk, Owen,
Kasaba, Quataert, Go9 ek, and Palairet indicate that certain sectors and regions of the
Ottoman economy enjoyed considerable growth and dynamism during the nineteenth
century. Clearly, the history of Ottoman economy was more complex and uneven than
the notion of steady decline would imply.13 Indeed, our attention is now shifting
increasingly towards sustainability of growth over time, and to its diffusion from the
dynamic enclave economies over to other branches of the economy. In this context, we
increasingly consider the dynamic interplay between political power struggles and
institutional structures on the one hand and processes o f economic growth and
retardation on the other. The current thesis addresses these issues of sustainability,
diffusion, and interaction.
Equally serious conceptual and historiographical problems have emanated from
the Eurocentric bias that has prevailed in Near Eastern studies. Eurocentrism has
assumed two primary forms in the literature. One o f these is conceptual Eurocentrism,
which has been particularly prominent amongst scholars who have subscribed to liberal
theories o f post-war ecoiiomic development. Economic historians borrowed heavily
from Rostow during the 1960s and the 1970s and viewed Ottoman economic history as
a process o f failed transition from traditional society to a mature industrial one, via the

intermediary stages o f “take-off’.14 The problem in this approach is that Rostow’s
theory o f the stages o f economic growth offers a universal model of economic
development that is based primarily on the European, and more specifically on the
British, experience.15 Quataert persuasively argues that scholars who see “failure” in the
Ottoman economy are in fact detecting divergence from the ‘unique’ British model and
thus reaching the sterile conclusion that the Ottoman economy simply did not follow the
British path to modernity, that is a rapid, factory-based industrialisation.16Alternatively,
Quataert maintains that comparisons with Japan, India and possibly China, where
labour-intensive, small-scale and rural manufacturing industries assumed greater
significance in the early stages o f modem economic development, would be more
meaningful in understanding the dynamics o f economic change and modernisation in
the Ottoman economy. Thus, Quataert points at the importance o f putting the Ottoman
experience into a more historical/comparative context, rather than developing
straightforward narratives o f failed industrialisation “according to a pattern prescribed
from outside”.17
An equally robust criticism of the standard modernisation approaches came from
the World System Analysis (WSA). The WSA conceives “underdevelopment” as a
manifestation o f an all-encompassing, long-term historical process that divided the
world economy into core and peripheral zones, rather than being a peculiar anomaly
marked by the lack or retardation o f certain precepts of modernity.18 Thus, the WSA
radically rejects the idea of an “ideal-type” pattern, or model, of economic development
that can constitute the yardstick against which the condition of underdevelopment or

backwardness could be detected and tested. This constitutes a strong criticism of the
modernist framework discussed above. Alternatively, the WSA emphasises the
historical nature o f underdevelopment and sees it as a dynamic process underlined by
the aggressive expansion of European capitalism on a global scale. In this approach, the
economic history of the Ottoman Empire appears as a process of incorporation into the
expanding capitalist world economy and subsequent peripherisation.19 Within this
context, the WSA pays attention not only to processes of crisis and retardation, but also
to those of adaptation and growth. For instance, the WSA enables us to explain the
dynamism of the sectors that articulated well with the moment o f peripherisation, as in
the case o f the rapid growth of cash crops or the apparent success of export oriented
manufacturing industries.20 Likewise, the rapid growth o f the urban construction
industry and the service sector, particularly in the booming port-cities of the
Mediterranean basin, emerge as a central theme in nineteenth century Ottoman
economic history.21 Simultaneously, however, the WSA provides us with an
interpretative framework that helps explain the retarding effects of peripherisation on
certain branches o f the economy, most notably on consumer goods industries.22 The
WSA also puts strong emphasis on the adverse and destabilising effects of financial and
economic dependency.23

Despite the advantages of the WSA over the modernist perspective as a
framework o f interpretation, the WSA comes with its own shortcomings. First, it has
been argued that, in WSA, relations of causality run down from the world system to the
specific localities in question. Consequently, peripheral zones emerge as passive, or
constrained/weak recipients of world economic influences. This methodological
position not only leads to a strong Eurocentric overtone in WSA, but it also undermines
its self-proclaimed historicism.24 Thus, rather ironically, WSA feeds into the
trivialisation and “otherisation” of peripheral histories, not unlike the modernist cum
nationalist approaches discussed above. Secondly, and in relation with the first, the
WSA has been criticised for its omission of non-economic factors in its assessment of
the emergence, expansion and consolidation of the modem world economy.25 This
omission, it is argued, manifests itself particularly strongly in its failure to account for
the diversity o f experiences within the periphery.
These criticisms have been voiced in Ottoman studies in recent years. In her
1983 contribution, Huricihan Islamoglu pointed to the Eurocentrism and economic
determinism o f the WSA and underlined the importance of bringing the political and
cultural processes, as well as the ideological fabric of the Ottoman society, into the
study of Ottoman social and economic history.26 This forceful criticism apparently
found acclaim among the proponents of WSA. From the mid-1980s onwards, a number
of scholars began to apply more refined versions o f the WSA to Ottoman history. The
works of Pamuk, Kasaba, Quataert, Keyder, Tabak and Owen are important in this
respect. These contributions enhance our understanding o f the ways in which local
structures interacted with broad global processes to condition the peculiar pattern of
peripherisation in Ottoman lands. For instance, Keyder, Pamuk and Owen draw our
attention to the crucial role played by the modernising Ottoman state apparatus in

determining the timing and degree of integration into the capitalist world economy.27
Quataert attempts, quite successfully, to bring the more silent segments of the Ottoman
population, namely peasants, workers, women and children, and examines, into the
study of Ottoman economic history.28 Kasaba studies the transformation of the networks
of exchange and commodity circulation and points to the dynamic participation of local
merchants, prominent landlords and bankers, as well as of European capitalists as
primary agents o f peripheral transformation in Western Anatolia.29 Keyder, Tabak and
others contribute to our understanding of the transformation of the relations of
production and property in agriculture.30
To sum up the discussion so far, the direction in Near Eastern studies, in general,
and Ottoman economic and social history, in particular, has turned towards writing
more humanist and politically open-minded histories that are sensitive to flaws of
nationalist rhetoric, ahistorical and teleological suppositions, and Eurocentricism. The
emphasis put on rigorous' empirical research in developing analytical models or
interpretative frameworks have also increased considerably. Thus, we already have a
better and more balanced understanding of the Ottoman economy. Straightforward
narratives of sustained economic ‘decline’ now appear inadequate and flawed,
empirically and conceptually. We see and admit the presence o f dynamic processes of
growth and transformation, side by side with those of retardation and crisis. Our
attention is shifting towards an analysis of the factors and structural processes that
impeded the sustainability of these processes of dynamism through time and their
‘diffusion’ between sectors. Likewise, we now have a better understanding of the local
processes that have conditioned, in important ways, the pattern of economic
transformation in Ottoman lands. Consequently, we realise the importance of studies
that aim at grasping the complex, dynamic, and fluidly interactive relations among
various local agents, including intermediary merchants, bankers, landlords, as well as
peasants and workers. We also put greater emphasis on the role played by local

institutional structures, notably by the Ottoman state, in the broader processes of
incorporation into the capitalist order during the nineteenth century.
The current thesis subscribes to the emerging neo-revisionist agenda in Ottoman
economic and social history and concentrates on the historical dynamics of economic
change and transformation m the Ottoman, empire during the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. Drawing heavily on the emergent literature on new institutional
economics, the thesis focuses on the dynamic interplay between local institutional
structures, the actions of market agents and the world economic forces, and analyses the
ways in which this process of interaction conditioned the pattern and timing of
economic change in the Ottoman Empire during the period under consideration. Thus, it
addresses the classical problem o f structure vs agency in historical change through an
institutionalist lens. This eclectic institutionalist approach constitutes precisely the main
contribution of the current thesis to the emerging neo-revisionist agenda in Ottoman
economic history.
The current thesis also puts forth certain methodological suggestions, which can
help improve our understanding of Ottoman economy and the ways with which we
study its history. More specifically, the thesis addresses the above mentioned questions
in a regional context and concentrates on the Selanik region during the late Ottoman
period from c.1875-1912. There are a number of conceptual and empirical reasons for
choosing the “region” as the primary unit o f analysis in discussing the dynamics of
economic change in the Ottoman empire. The “region” constitutes a robust unit of
analysis that enables us to maintain a careful balance between theoretical analysis and
empirical research. Sources on Ottoman economic history are plentiful, but they are
difficult to use and master effectively. This situation renders empirical research
problematical. Under the circumstances, scholars are forced to work within more
feasible research agendas, and put emphasis either on in-depth empirical research or on
broad structural analysis. It seems, more empirically oriented scholars choose to work
on relatively narrow topics, and undertake research in various archives and libraries
consulting a wide range of different resources. More conceptually motivated scholars
tend to use resources that are readily available and relatively easy to use and concentrate
more on theoretical issues and discussions. Both approaches have had their drawbacks.
In the case of empirically oriented studies, the topics often remained too specific, and
the scholars found it difficult to associate a singular aspect o f the Ottoman economy
10


with the broad trends and dynamics underlining its transformation. In the case of more
conceptually oriented approaches, contributions often suffer from the inadequacy of
empirical research. Powerful theoretical statements often remain unsatisfactorily tested
against historical evidence and vulnerable to powerful empirical criticisms. Early
theoretical contributions of scholars subscribing to the standard WSA suffer from such
empirical drawbacks.31 Similarly, broad macro-studies that use flimsy and uncritically
compiled statistical evidence suffer from theoretical laxity.32
A closer regional focus should provide us with an excellent opportunity to
address broad theoretical problems within a more feasible research agenda. European
and Ottoman sources often present themselves on a regional basis, and provide us with
rich qualitative and quantitative information on almost all aspects of economic life. In
this respect, a regional approach can serve as a strategic guide in the actual process of
research and ease the difficulty o f locating and finding relevant documents among
massive collections, particularly in the Ottoman archives situated in Istanbul. In
addition, a regional focus enables the researcher to clearly demonstrate, and even
correct, the existing biases and weaknesses in the evidence at hand. Finally, provincial
sources, especially the relevant Ottoman sources, have not yet been properly utilised so
far, despite the rich information they provide on economic life. Regional research can
help make up for this negligence.
As a unit o f analysis, the “region” is a more suitable unit o f analysis in view of
the diversity o f economic structures observed in the Ottoman empire. Vast differences
in factor endowments, in geography, in climate, in the degree o f centralisation, in the
level o f integration with overseas markets, and in local customs and conventions do not
lend themselves to easy generalisations and clear-cut conclusions over the dynamics of
economic change and transformation in the Ottoman empire. Therefore, a regional
outlook may provide us with a more focused and robust framework that is capable of
accounting for the richness o f experiences and the variations in patterns of economic
transformation throughout the empire. Only along with the accumulation of such
detailed surveys on regional economies, will we be in a position to fully understand not

only the transformation of economic relations in the Ottoman empire and the interactive
dynamics and consequence? of its integration with the capitalist world order during the
nineteenth century. The accumulation o f such research would also enable us to make
much needed inter-regional comparisons that would reveal important clues about the
broad dynamics and the structural patterns of economic change in Ottoman lands.
Regional monographs constitute the first and indispensable step to undertaking such an
academic endeavour. It is with this belief and hope that I have undertaken the present
study, concentrating on one of the leading economic “regions” of the empire, namely
the Selanik region.
A number o f historical and methodological reasons justify the choice o f Selanik
as the subject matter o f a case study. First, Selanik was one o f the most commercialised
regions o f the Ottoman empire. The region was situated at an crossroads that linked the
Balkan peninsula to the Mediterranean basin, and the Aegean Sea to the Adriatic.33
Owing much to this locational advantage, the region had' for long been an integral part
of the Levantine world of commerce, while also maintaining close relations with
European economies.34 From the seventeenth century onwards, the region increasingly
came under the orbit o f the expanding “world” economy, becoming one of the primary
“integrated” regions of the empire by the end of the nineteenth century. With a dynamic
port-town in Salonica, a prolific hinterland economy, developed commercial
connections with European economies, and an extensive railway network that linked the
entire region to continental Europe, Selanik was indeed a leading zone of peripheral
engagement in Ottoman lands during the late nineteenth century.35 In this respect,

Selanik offers a site where we can observe the transformative effects o f world economic
forces.
Secondly, Selanik was one o f the most important Ottoman provinces where the
central government could assume a relatively strong presence and could implement its
policies effectively, in comparison to, say, the distant Eastern Anatolian and Arab
provinces o f the Empire.36 In this respect, the Selanik region also emerges as an ideal
site to assess the role played by the Ottoman state in processes of economic change and
transformation.
Thirdly, Selanik’s regional economy had peculiar, if contradictory, features that
make it an attractive object o f historical inquiry in its own right. On the one hand, we
see manifestations o f ‘modernity’, such as comprehensive marketing networks mediated
by large trading houses and intermediary merchants, extensive railway systems, modem
banks and other financial institutions, growing urban areas, burgeoning manufacturing
industries, and dynamic urban construction and service sectors. On the other hand, we
see facets o f retardation and economic standstill, typically marked by the persistence of
an undercapitalised and vulnerable agrarian economy at large, widespread absentee
landlordism, distressing tenancy arrangements, and endemic rent-seeking activities, all
of which undermined the economic potential of the region.37 Similar contrasts existed in
other parts of the empire as well. However, the degree o f contrast appears particularly
striking in the case of Selanik, because of the unusual strength o f its “modem” sectors
and features. In what follows, I will try to explain this “duality” o f economic structures
and processes in Selanik’s regional economy, a dualism which apparently deepened in
time.

Finally, by concentrating on the case of Selanik I hope to overcome the
predicaments of “nationalist compartmentalisation” that has prevailed in studies on the
history o f the Ottoman Empire. An important consequence o f the prominence of
nationalist world-views in Near Eastern studies has been the dearth of communication
and cooperation among scholars who specialise on different “nations”. These specialists
tend to confine their work on a specific part of the empire and ignore “other” parts.
Cooperation among the specialists o f different “nations” remains limited, informal and
unstructured. More importantly perhaps, until very recently, governments on each side,
but especially Turkish authorities, have been jealously supervising the access to the
historical archives under their control. This situation has not only frustrated sensible
researchers but also has perpetuated controversies and nationalist monologues, leaving
little room for constructive debate and criticism. Over the last decade and a half,
however, scholars have begun to show much greater interest not only in the rich
information available in Ottoman provincial archives that exist on former Ottoman
lands, but also in comparing notes, sharing information and participating in open
minded debates and discussions. Still, there is a great need for further debate and
research that go beyond the narrow confines of nationalist rhetoric and national
boundaries. As a Turkish scholar, I feel obliged to address this need by moving beyond
the political boundaries of contemporary Turkey and concentrating on the economic
history of a region that supposedly falls into an “other” zone o f specialisation. I hope
my endeavour will contribute to the emerging debates and the creation of a new
academic environment that goes beyond nationalist prejudice.
As for the time period on which this thesis focuses, the late nineteenth century
appears as a crucial turning point in Near Eastern economic and social history. First, the
late nineteenth century marks the full-blown integration of the Ottoman empire into the
expanding capitalist world economy.38 The long process of the peripherisation of
Ottoman lands reached its economic and institutional apex in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries. The transformations taking place during this period left a
strong imprint on the economic and social history o f the Near East, conditioning the
pattern o f socio-economic change in the region until the early 1930s.39 The advent of
the Great Depression in the 1930s marked the beginnings of a new era of growing

protectionism, relative economic isolation and enhanced political independence.40
Focusing on the late nineteenth century promises to shed light on the partly regressive
and partly modernising but certainly complex effects of the integration of Ottoman
lands into the modem world economy, as a background to the nationalist economies that
later emerged in the region.
Secondly, the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries saw the culmination
of the reform efforts o f the Ottoman government. As before in the Tanzimat era (1839
1876), the central government took measures to enhance political centralisation,
consolidate state finances and promote economic development during the period under
consideration. In general, the mixed results of these efforts failed to bring about the
desired effect in modernisation and economic development. However, the late
nineteenth century reforms were consequential and played an important role in
determining the unique, non-colonial, pattern of peripherisation that surfaced in much of
the Ottoman lands.41 In this regard, the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth
centuries emerge as a period when we can study the impact of Ottoman state policy on
economic change and development in crystallised forms.
2. Sources and Structure:
2.1. Sources:
In my research, I have consulted a wide range of European and Ottoman
sources. The majority o f the European materials I relied on come from the British
archives and libraries. I have used the relevant archival documents at the Public Record
Office (PRO) quite exhaustively. The Foreign Office documents for the period of
c. 1870-1912 proved especially useful. I have surveyed not only the correspondence
between the consular office in Selanik and the embassy in Istanbul, but also the
correspondence of consular representations within broader Macedonia, which included
the neighbouring provinces o f Kosova and Manastir in addition to Selanik.
I have also used a range o f official publications issued by the British and French
governments, which included the British Parliamentary Papers and the publications of
40 Owen and Pamuk, Middle East Economies, 3-8. Also see D. Rothermund, The Global Impact o f the Great Depression, 1929-1939, (London and New York: Routledge, 1996), 74-81. 41 Pamuk, Osmanli Ekonomisinde Bagimlihk, 7-10, 157-162.
15


the British Chamber of Commerce o f Istanbul. The most important French publication I
have used has been the official journal o f the French Chamber o f Commerce in Istanbul,
Revue commerciale du levant, bulletin mansuel de la chambre de commerce frangaise
de Constantinople. These official publications include commercial reports sent from
consular representations in the provinces. Fortunately, the reports coming from Selanik
and other Macedonian provinces appeared regularly in these publications.
The British archival materials and the above cited official publications provided
me with valuable information. They were particularly useful for the statistical
information they contain and for the rich historical detail they provide on foreign trade,
banking, local marketing networks, railways, urban manufacturing and construction
industries and, most notably, on export-oriented agriculture. However, they reveal
relatively little information on ‘local* institutional processes, especially on government
policy, taxation and the structuration of distributional processes.
Ottoman sources proved more prolific on these crucial issues. The Prime
Ministry archives, Bagbakanhk Argivi (BA), in Istanbul served as the most significant
resource of my research. I have consulted a number of key collections in the BA,
beginning with the extensive papers of the Inspectorate of the Rumelian Provinces,
Rumeli Mufettigligi Evraki. This collection includes the correspondence between the
provincial governments and Istanbul, as well as reports, proposals and other official
documents presented to various ministries. These documents yielded valuable
information on almost all aspects of economic life, especially on land issues, taxation
and agricultural reform. Unfortunately, this excellent collection covers a relatively
limited time period, 1903-1908. I have consulted other collections for data on other
years within the time period under consideration and for additional information.
My initial efforts concentrated on the registers o f the Sublime Porte’s
correspondence with the provinces, Bab-i Ali Evrak Odasi Vilayet Gelen-Giden
Defterleri. However, my efforts yielded very little information, mainly because the files
pertaining to the European provinces o f the empire under this collection were not yet
properly organised and available to researchers. In order to reach the same documents or
to get an idea about them, I have consulted the Registers of the Summaries and
Duplicates of the Sublime Porte’s correspondence, Bab-i Ali Evrak Odasi Ayniyat
Defterleri. Unfortunately, this collection revealed little on economic affairs, because it
16


contains detailed information on administrative matters that is of relatively little use for
the immediate priorities o f my research.
A collection that proved useful, both in terms of coverage and content, was the
archives o f the Council of State (§ura-i Devlet). The §ura-i Devlet collection is massive
and includes hundreds o f thousands of documents. This situation compelled me to cut
my inquiries into this source down to a manageable size. Thus, I have consulted only
the documents pertaining to the Province o f Selanik and to the departments of
Commerce (ticaret), Forests, Mines and Agriculture (orman meadin ve ziraat), Customs
(riisumat), and Finance (maliye), and to contracts (mukavelat). These documents contain
rich information on reform policies, taxation and land matters. A substantial drawback
of the §ura-i Devlet documents in general is that they often reflect the immediate
considerations and priorities o f the council and yield limited information on the actual
implementation o f policy in the field. However, the documents also reveal abundant
background information on the issues discussed. Thus, I was able to use the Council of
State documents as a source of information on the policy priorities and orientation of
the central government and as a source of some historical detail on the real economy.
I have consulted two more collections in the BA, namely the minutes of the
Council o f Ministers (Meclisi Viikela), which involve the major executive decisions of
the central government. Both collections revealed rich historical detail on economic
affairs. Similar to the documents o f the Council of State, however, they remain silent
about the actual implementation o f the decisions taken at the top of Ottoman
bureaucracy, unless they include summary references to the background of the issues
discussed.
In order to check and complement the official sources mentioned above, I have
consulted various local newspapers and journals as well as a wide range of official and
semi-official publications. The local newspapers I have consulted includ two
independent newspapers published by liberal intellectuals in Salonica, namely Asir and
Journal de Salonique, and two newspapers published by the provincial government,
namely Rumeli and Selanik. These newspapers, especially Asir and Journal de
Salonique, constitute by far the richest source on economic affairs and provide detailed
information on agriculture, manufacturing and commerce, as well as on reform policies
and taxation. In addition, I have consulted the semi-official journal of the Istanbul
17


Chamber of Commerce (Dersaadet Ticaret Odasi Gazetesi), which contain relevant
information on general economic issues as well as on the Selanik region. Finally, two
journals published by the'Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture, namely Ticaret ve
Ziraat Nezareti Mecmuasi and Orman ve Maden ve Ziraat Mecmuasi, contain valuable
information on agriculture and the implementation of agricultural reform schemes in the
province.
Finally, a series of official publications issued by the Ottoman government
proved particularly useful, especially for the rich statistics and detailed sectoral analysis
they contain. The agricultural statistics published by the Ottoman government in 1907
contain valuable data on output levels, yield ratios, prices and landholding. The general
statistics published by the Ottoman government in 1897 contain equally valuable data
on almost all sectors o f the Ottoman economy on a provincial basis. Likewise, the
provincial yearbooks (Salnames) contain useful information on regional economies and
valuable output statistics, as well as detailed population figures and fiscal data. Lastly,
the provincial budgets published by the Ottoman government provide valuable fiscal
data. These statistics and publications proved particularly useful in estimating output
levels and trends in agricultural production and thus contributed significantly to the
quantitative rigour of the current thesis.
2.2. Structure:
The thesis is divided into six chapters. The first three chapters discuss the
agricultural sector, which was by far the most important sector of the regional economy..
Chapter One attempts to quantify the structural shifts taking place in the agricultural
sector and to establish trends in sectoral performance. It taps the rich quantitative
evidence available in European and Ottoman archives, provides an extensive discussion
of the weaknesses and strength of the available statistics and suggests new methods of
estimation that can be used to measure economic performance in agriculture. Chapter
Two focuses on the economic conjuncture, discussing the transformation of the
agricultural sector in tandem with the broader developments taking place in
international markets. Within this framework, the chapter primarily focuses on demand
side factors as well as certain market-bound institutional processes as the primary
facilitators o f both growth and retardation in the agrarian economy. Chapter Three
18


assesses the impact of state policy on agriculture, with an emphasis on supply-side
dynamics, and on the impact of reforms instituted by the Ottoman government. In
addition, the chapter examines the largely retarding impact of the prevailing fiscal
processes and practices on agriculture.
Chapter Four discusses the transformation o f rural socio-economic structures in
response to the shifts taking place in the economic conjuncture, on the one hand, and the
reform and modernisation efforts o f the Ottoman government, on the other. The chapter
concentrates primarily on redistributional processes and associated institutional
structures, namely property rights, tenure systems and taxation. It discusses the political
and economic dynamics underlying the transformation of these institutions, and
considers the impact o f this broad transformation process on the commercialisation of
the agrarian sector, processes of rural displacement, and the persistence of speculative
and “rent-seeking” economic activities. Chapter Five examines the transformation and
growth o f urban economies while focusing on the development of the urban service
sector, construction industry and manufacturing. Finally, the thesis offers some
concluding remarks on the peculiarities of Ottoman path to peripherisation in the light
of the case of Selanik.

CHAPTER I
THE PATTERN OF AGRARIAN TRANSFORMATION,
TRENDS AND DIRECTIONS
A QUANTITATIVE APPROACH
Introduction
Agriculture constituted the most important sector of the regional economy
during the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries. About 70-80% of the
regional population lived in the countryside and the sector probably accounted for about
60% o f the total income generated within the regional economy.1 Agricultural products
accounted for the bulk o f the exports and brought much income and prosperity into the
region.2 Therefore, a thorough discussion of the changes and shifts taking place in the
agricultural sector assumes great importance for the comprehensiveness of our analysis
of economic change in Selanik during the period under consideration.
This chapter outlines the basic transformations taking place in agrarian economy
of the Selanik region during the Hamidian years (1876-1908). In what follows, I
develop a quantitative approach that should help us delineate the direction and timing of
the shifts taking place in the agrarian economy of the region. In this context, I
concentrate mainly on estimating changing levels and composition of agricultural output
for selected benchmark years. Throughout the discussion, I use a wide range of British,
French and Ottoman sources, most o f which have never been used before. I discuss in
detail the relative weaknesses and strengths o f the these sources, and seek ways of
improving their accuracy and reliability in light of qualitative evidence gathered from
1 V. Eldem, Osmanli Imparatorlugu ’nun Iktisadi §artlari §artlari Hakkinda bir Tetkik, [Research on the Economic Conditions o f the Ottoman Empire] (Ankara: Turk Tarih Kurumu Basimevi, 1994), 225. According to the estimates o f Eldem, agriculture accounted for the 57% of the GDP generated with the European provinces of the Empire in 1907. For the composition o f regional population see Table 1.15 below.

both European and Ottoman archives. I also employ, whenever possible, more than one
estimation method to quantify the changes taking place in the level and composition of
agricultural production. This quantitative effort largely sets the empirical background
for the narrative of the following two chapters, which discuss the structural
transformations taking place in Selanik’s agrarian economy during the period under
consideration.
The current chapter also aims to till the statistical lacuna in Ottoman economic
history, which continues to undermine the systematic discussion o f some key issues and
impedes the resolution o f certain controversies. For instance, the absolute and relative
performance o f the nineteenth century Ottoman economy is an issue that is yet to be
resolved.3 The pioneering works o f Issawi, Eldem, Karpat, Lampe and Jackson, Pamuk,
Owen, Quataert and more recently of Palairet contributed in important ways to our
understanding of the performance o f the nineteenth century Ottoman economy.4 We
now have a better understanding of demographic trends, foreign trade, capital flows,
prices, wages, and o f ‘national income’ for selected benchmark years. Yet, there is still
a great need for detailed quantitative research in order to understand better the issues of
Ottoman economic development in historical perspective. With its comprehensive
statistical base and detailed methodological discussion the current chapter is an

important empirical and technical contribution to the existing literature on the economic
history o f the late nineteenth century Ottoman Empire.
The current chapter also constitutes a strong critique of the existing estimates of
Ottoman agricultural production for the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries.
In 1970, Vedat Eldem produced quite comprehensive estimates of Ottoman agricultural
output for the period 1890-1910. His figures suggest 27.5% growth in agricultural
production, which maintains considerable dynamism and growth in the sector for this
period.5 Eldem’s estimates have been widely used by scholars who have argued
likewise that Ottoman agriculture grew considerably, if modestly, during the same
period. However, despite widespread circulation, Eldem’s data and his methods of
estimation have not been seriously discussed. Scholars simply took for granted Eldem’s
unique and pioneering research in the field and used his estimates to discuss trends in
Ottoman agriculture.
Eldem mainly used a combination of fiscal data and agricultural statistics
published by the Ottoman government to estimate both the production trends and levels
of output for selected benchmark years. It seems Eldem did not control for the
weaknesses and inconsistencies inherent in these sources. The following analysis shows
quite clearly that Eldem overestimated agricultural performance.
The current chapter suggests certain methods and techniques of estimation that
would improve the reliability and accuracy of Eldem’s estimates. As we shall see in this
and the following chapters, agricultural performance remained sluggish in Selanik and
strove to overcome such serious problems as adverse price trends, a heavy tax-burden,
prohibitive transaction costs and serious institutional inadequacies during the period
under consideration. The existing literature also suggests that similar factors retarded
agricultural development in other parts and regions of the Empire. This observation
instigates us to rethink our understanding of the performance o f Ottoman agriculture in
late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.6 Undoubtedly, we need more research and

consistent historical narrative. The technical discussion included in this chapter
constitutes a preliminary, but significant, step in this direction.
1. Measuring Performance in Sub-Sectors: Cereal Production, Cash Crop Production and Animal Husbandry
In this section, I will attempt to measure output performance in the primary sub
sectors o f the agrarian economy, namely cereal production, cash crop production and
animal husbandry. This is a challenging task. The difficulty is not in the lack of
statistical evidence. Raw data is available from a wide range o f European and Ottoman
sources. Agricultural output estimates, provincial tithe returns, foreign trade statistics,
and agricultural prices were frequently cited in a variety o f sources, such as the official
agricultural statistics, provincial yearbooks (salnames), European consular reports,
provincial newspapers, and the respective journals of the Ottoman, French and British
Chambers o f Commerce. The challenge is in extracting relatively accurate and
consistent measurement of performance from these sources. The available data is often
partial and sometimes weak and therefore one has to use them with caution and critical
judgement. Yet, for all the difficulties of quantifying agricultural trends, a
methodological analysis of the available data based on careful assumptions does yield
reliable estimates.
1.1. Cereal Production
1.1.1. Official Output Estimates
An important source in delineating trends in cereal production is the official
output estimates published by the Ottoman government. The Hamidian authorities
showed an interest in compiling and publishing agricultural output statistics. Their
primary motive in data collection was fiscal. Agricultural taxes, especially the tithe
(a§ar), constituted the main source o f revenue for the Ottoman government.7 It was

23


crucial for the authorities to constantly monitor the collection of these revenues. Their
main concern was to estimate the optimum tax base, or to determine how much revenue
was ‘normal’ and what could define “under” or “over” taxation. At least in theory, the
tithe was tuned to output levels at a fixed rate of 10%.8 Thus, estimating the tax base
depended on estimating the total produce of the land. Based on this estimate, the
authorities could expect to generate a certain amount of revenue. If a given year’s
revenue fell below that expected level, then the tax would fall in arrears and anything
above the ‘norm’ would simply be a bonus to the government coffers.
Direct estimation was out o f question for the authorities. The existing land
registers were incomplete and out o f date, particularly in the early days of the Hamidian
era. Although the attempts to improve land registers yielded some success towards the
end o f the century, the records did not allow for accurate estimates of agricultural
production levels during a good part of the Hamidian period.9 Under the circumstances,
the authorities had to find alternative ways of estimating the ‘tax base’ and levels of
production.
In response to this need, officials relied on provincial tax records, especially the
tithe returns from previous years. This method eradicated the fiscal purpose o f output
estimation. Estimating the output based on the existing tax-records would reveal little
new information about the optimum tax base in a given year. As we will see in detail
below, the tithe returns of the Ottoman government were only very loosely linked to
actual output levels, mainly because the practice of tax-farming obscured the linkages
between taxation and production.10 An optimum tax base could hardly be assessed on
the basis o f such fiscally rooted output estimates, which would, in the last instance, do
little more than equating the optimum tax base with “what could be collected” rather
than with “what is due for collection”.

Still, the Ottoman officials did all that was possible to make the most out of the
tithe data. They had to cope with certain difficulties. The tithe revenue records, even on
a sub-provincial (kaza) basis, were not itemised according to the crops cultivated.
Therefore, even if the total value of production could be tentatively estimated, it would
not be possible to determine the weights of various agricultural products in total output.
In order to overcome this obstacle, the local authorities concentrated on more
disaggregate tax data. According to the regulations governing the collection of the
tithes, the tax-farmers (multezims) and the salaried tax-collectors of the Ottoman
government (the mua$$irs) had to keep detailed tax records that indicated the quantity of
each crop on which the tithe was levied.11 In practice, however, the tax-records often
remained incomplete. Both the tax-farmers and the tax-collectors under-reported the
volume and value of the product and pocketed the difference at the government’s
expense. Sometimes, they did not even bother to keep proper accounts at all.
Nevertheless, the appointed officers of the Ottoman government worked in cooperation
with the local chambers o f agriculture, the village headmen and the local revenue
departments o f provincial governments to make use of these books as a sample of sorts
to determine the weights o f different products.12 Thus, they eventually came up with
weighed tithe returns for each district (kaza) in nominal terms. Then they deflated the
nominal values by the average local price of each crop to determine a rough output
estimate in terms o f quantity. These output estimates were finally deflated by the
average yield of agricultural land in any given district, in order to reach indicative
estimates o f the area under cultivation for each crop. All .estimated district values were
aggregated to reach provincial (vilayet) figures.13
It is my impression that the Ottoman authorities used this ‘fiscal’ method to
estimate levels o f agricultural output and the area under cultivation during the period
under consideration. The estimates published in the provincial yearbooks were certainly
See below for a discussion of the practice of tax-farming. Also see Chapter 4. 11 Vefik, TekalifKavaidi, 262-263.
12 These observations are based on an 1898 report on the collection and compilation of agricultural statistics throughout the Empire, which was published in the journal o f the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce. D.T.O.G., 7.Za.l316 (19.3.1899), No. 699: 169.
12 In provincial yearbooks (Salnames), it is actually possible to find output figures pertaining to each sub-province, which neatly sum up to vilayet figures. So the data was probably predominantly gathered on a sub-province basis.


based on this crude method.14 Even the estimates of the more comprehensive 1907
agricultural statistics were, largely based on the tithe revenues.15 The main difference of
these later statistics was that, the officials supplemented the fiscal data with auxiliary
information in order to improve the reliability of their estimates.16 For this purpose,
questionnaires were sent out to the provinces to be completed by the local chambers of
commerce, administrative councils and the special survey committees established by the
provincial governments. Most questionnaires were complete and returned to Istanbul.
Even if they were not always accurate, the supplementary information they provided
must have helped the Statistical Office in Istanbul to refine their estimates.17

These official statistics must be used with caution because of the probable
inconsistencies involved in data collection, especially before 1907. Comparing numbers
compiled by different people, under different circumstances and at different times must
have created certain irregularities in the available data. Even if all data sets were
technically comparable, one still has to account for the influence of non-economic
In the yearbooks it is yery common to come across with crude calculations such as ‘so much tithe was collected and therefore this much was produced in the sub-province’.

factors. For instance, the “fiscal” output estimates might in fact reflect improvements in
taxation practices, rather than a net output growth. Similarly, changes in the definition
of the tax base, such as increases in the rate of taxation, if not accounted for, could lead
to misleading impressions about the performance of the sector. Clearly, caution is
necessary in using the available statistics to delineate trends and to estimate output
levels, especially for the earlier years of the period under consideration.
For all their shortcomings, however, the existing output statistics are still useful.
The data are not entirely arbitrary and allow us to offer suggestions on both the changes
in the level and composition o f agricultural output by way o f comparative static
analysis, provided that the results are cross-checked by alternative sources and/or
methods o f estimation. Furthermore, the 1907 statistics are particularly comprehensive
and reliable. They are relatively less fiscal and certainly more detailed in nature than
anything else we have at hand.18 A comprehensive population census undertaken in
1906 and the general improvement in land registers also contribute to the accuracy and
reliability o f the 1907 estimates.19 Thus, 1907 statistics can be considered as good as
any benchmark can be in determining the levels of agricultural output. In the following
analysis, I will also use the 1907 statistics as weights in the computation o f various
price indices.
Official statistics suggest considerable contraction in cereal output in the Selanik
region between 1890 and 1907 (Table 1.1). Overall, cereal production seems to have
declined by as much as 38.8% during the 1890s and early 1900s. Our knowledge of the
broad trends in the regional economy corroborates this impression. As we shall see in
Chapter-2, adverse price trends, severe crop failures, prohibitive transaction costs and
18 The later official statistics published in the Unionist period (1908-1918) seem to be less reliable than the 1907/09 statistics of the Hamidian period. The Unionist figures seem to have been somewhat inflated by the authorities in need of ideological and political legitimacy. For instance, based on these official estimates Eldem suggests that Ottoman agricultural output grew by 27%, or at about a rate o f 5% per annum within the five years between 1909/10 and 1914/15 (Eldem, Osmanli Imparatorlugu’nun Iktisadi § artlari, 35). There is nothing in the literature that would justify such rapid rate o f growth in Ottoman agricultural production. Especially considering the destabilising effects of the Italian (1911) and the two Balkan Wars (1912) it would be unrealistic to suggest such rapid growth in output figures. For the drawbacks of the Unionist statistics see Devlet istatistik Enstitiisii, Osmanli Donemi Tarim Istatistikleri, XVII-XIX.

various “market-failures” put local cereal producers under distress and compelled them
to switch to the production o f more lucrative and less bulky cash crops during the same
period. Under the circumstances, we would normally expect a significant contraction in
cereal production.
The data presented in Table 1.1 also reveal important clues about the changing
composition of cereal production in Selanik. The decline in the production of basic food
staples, namely wheat and maize, was relatively moderate, whereas the contraction in
the production o f barley, oats and rye was significant. Consequently, the share of basic
food staples in total cereal production increased from 1890-1907. More specifically, the
share of wheat and maize in total cereal output rose from 50.7% in 1890 to 64.3% in
1907. In contrast, the relative share of such non-staple cereals as rye, oats and barley
declined proportionately during the same period.
In sum, the official statistics suggest a notable contraction in cereal production
in the Selanik region during 1890-1907. The figures also suggest that the decline in the
production of non-staple cereals was particularly swift. The contraction in the
production of wheat, and to a lesser extent maize, remained relatively limited in the
same period. Although these broad observations are in tune with the conjuncture of the
regional economy, the rate of decline suggested by the official estimates must be
crosschecked by alternative methods of estimation.
1.1.2. Fiscal Data and Trends in Output Growth
Using the Ottoman tithe data to delineate trends in output performance requires
much critical assessment o f fiscal data. In the following analysis, I will first discuss the
nature and characteristics of the available tax data. I will then analyse certain features of
the taxation process to clarify the assumptions underlining the method of estimation I
employ. Finally, I will discuss the adjustments necessary to make better use of tithe
revenues as indicators o f trends in output performance.
Matbaasi, 1996). For a recent re-assessment of Ottoman census results for the European provinces of the


Sources
The Hamidian authorities published a multitude o f provincial budgets from the
mid-1880s onwards. It is possible to extract comprehensive tithe data from these
provincial budgets. Our current understanding of the ways in which these provincial
budgets were prepared is limited. It seems that the preparation of the budgets was a
cumbersome process, and involved various steps of assessment and revaluation. At the
end o f each financial year, the tax commissions and the administrative councils of each
sub-province (kaza) would jointly prepare a detailed fiscal report on the revenues and
expenditures of each local government. The report was then forwarded to the central
provincial ( vilayet) administration. The provincial government would assess all such
reports and prepare a final vilayet report that was sent to the central revenue
departments in Istanbul. The central authorities would gather all the vilayet reports and
use them to compile the revenue side of the final state budgets for the next fiscal year.
The same vilayet reports constituted the basis of provincial budgets.20
Ottoman provincial budgets had a political significance as well as a fiscal
meaning. It seems that, especially throughout the relatively ‘centralist’ Hamidian
period, the authorities used budgets to impose tighter checks and controls over the
provincial administrations.21 Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the provincial
authorities probably manipulated budgetary figures to make things look better or worse
depending on the political and fiscal circumstances. The figures could be, and possibly
were, inflated or deflated in accordance with the fiscal needs of the provincial
governments.
This political distortion effect can be inferred from qualitative archival evidence,
but it is very difficult to show exactly in which year the distortion had more impact on
published tax figures compared to other years. Therefore, I will simply assume that the
political distortion effect was even in each year. The anticipation is that the actual
distortion effects would cancel each other out and leave long-term trend unaltered.

Furthermore, the effects of political concerns on tax data appear to be more plausible for
relatively distant provinces of the Empire and it is reasonable to suggest that such
effects would be relatively “insignificant” in the case o f the province of Selanik, where
the presence and control of the central government was more of a reality. Therefore, I
will use budgetary tithe figures to delineate trends in output performance. However, we
must first clarify the precise content of the tax base to reach more accurate and
consistent estimates.
The Definition o f the Tax Base
Following the establishment of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration (PDA)
in 1881, the Ottoman government agreed to grant the right to collect and manage certain
revenues to the PDA. Amongst these revenues were the tithes accruing from the
production of two important cash crops, namely tobacco and silk.22 From 1883 onwards,
the PDA was in full control o f tobacco and silk tithes and the Ottoman government had
practically nothing to do with the collection and management of these revenues.
Although the Ottoman budgets continued to include the silk and tobacco tithes, these
items were kept under a distinct category separate from the standard tithe (a§ar).
According to a draft budget I have at hand, both the tobacco (diihan) and the silk (harir)
tithes were listed under ‘miscellaneous revenue’ (hasilat-i miiteferrika).23
This accounting practice has important implications for the following analysis. If
the tax base covered by the standard tithe incorporates all agricultural products except
tobacco and silk, then the tithe as such would mainly relate to cereal production. This is
clearly the case for Selanik. According to the 1907 statistics, cereals accounted for
about 66.4% and cash crops constituted around 26.5% of the total value of agricultural
production in Selanik (See Table 1.2). The combined value o f tobacco and silk cocoon
production accounted for 24.1% o f the same total. These numbers indicate that cereal

production dominated the tax base. According to the figures in Table 1.2, cereals
constituted about 86.7% of the total value of the tax base. The tithe returns would
therefore be the best proxy for determining trends in cereal production. This is exactly
how I will interpret the tithe data in the following discussion.

The Tithe and the Methods o f its Collection
The Ottoman tithe was in theory linked to production; that is to say, it should
constitute 10% of the agricultural output. In practice however, the tithe was somewhat
disconnected from the production process. The main reason for this disconnection lay in
tax collection methods prevailing in the Empire.
During the Hamidian period there were two ways of collecting the taxes. The
first was direct collection by salaried officials of the central government, and the second
was tax-farming. Despite repeated attempts to introduce direct taxation in all provinces,
tax-farming retained its importance and accounted for about 90-95% of the tithes
collected until the end of the Hamidian era.24
In principle, tax-farming was a straightforward process. Each year, the local
authorities would organise franchise auctions for the collection of the tithes from each
24 See Akarli, The Problems o f External Pressures', and, Akarli, “Economic Policy”; §ener, Tanzimat Donemi Osmanli, 119-139; Vefik, TekalifKavaidi, 262-263. Also see Chapter-4.
31


village in the province. The authorities would set the minimum auction price for each
village, usually based on the actual prices received in the preceding three years and
announce their average as the current year’s initial auction price. The bidders would
then deliver their offers to the local administrative council, which would publicly
announce the highest bid and bidder for each village. From that point on, any bidder
willing to offer a higher price could step in and take over the franchise agreement within
a grace period. The local authorities would wait as long as possible to hear offers and
finally would grant the franchise to the highest bidder. The final bidder, who received
the right to collect the taxes in a particular village for a period of one year only, would
pay the government the agreed-upon sum in cash, usually in five instalments.25
This method created complications in the actual taxation process. The level of
government revenues accruing from tax farming would theoretically depend on several
factors:
The tithe returns would depend on the number of tax-farming units to be
auctioned. More settlements/population meant more auctions, and more auctions, ceteris
paribus, meant higher revenues for the government. In other words, the tithe-retums had
to be a function of rural population and the land under cultivation.
Second, the tithe returns depended on the rate o f taxation. The auctioning
authorities included a due rise in the legal rate of taxation in the minimum auction
prices. It was the tax-farmers’ responsibility to increase their collections
proportionately.
Third, tithe returns depended on the government’s capacity to enforce and
effectively supervise the auctions and make them more competitive. This, in turn,
depended on, above all, the government’s administrative capacity. Better
communication and transportation facilities, accountability of local governments, and
multi-layered bureaucratic controls over the auctions would help secure fair auctioning
and tax-farm returns.
Market conditions and the economic conjuncture had an important role to play in
determining the government’s capacity to tax. Tax-farmers had to convert the tithe
25 For the details of the practice of tax-farming see Vefik, TekalifKavaidi, 290-299.
32


collected in-kind into cash by selling it in the available markets at current prices. Thus,
in years of price depression, it was very difficult for the authorities to attract bidders to
auctions and to maintain, let alone, to increase the tax-revenue.26 Furthermore, the
existing tax-farming regulations favoured risk-averse tax-farmers, and gave them the
time to assess the potential profitability of the franchise agreement. Often, tax-farming
auctions were held between mid-June arid early August.27 By that time in the year,
potential bidders were in a position to make good guesses about the quantity as well as
the quality of the summer crops.28 Simultaneously, potential tax-farmers could get a
good sense of the trend of the going market prices and of the profitability of a tax-farm
in a given region or even village. Adverse price trends and severe harvest failures would
often drive risk-averse smaller players out of auctions. As the time to prepare the fields
for winter crops approached, the government officials would be desperate to find a tax
farmer to collect the tithes. Under the circumstances, a few big, and often influential,
tax-farmers could easily step in and purchase the tax-farms at exorbitantly low rates,
hence, obliging the government to settle for low tax returns.29
Finally, the government’s taxation capacity would depend on the ‘marketability’
of the produce. Reductions in transaction costs, because of, for instance, the
construction of new railway lines or lower railway tariffs, would increase the profit
margin o f tax-farmers and hence render tax-farming a more attractive investment
option. Under such circumstances, we would expect the auctions to be more
competitive, adding to the taxation capacity of the provincial governments.
These theoretical dynamics o f tax farming suggest that there were many factors
that could de-link the tax returns from actual output levels. To reiterate again, these
factors o f de-linkage included the rate o f taxation, the government’s taxation capacity,
the economic conjuncture and market conditions. If we could successfully account for
all the main factors o f de-linkage, the tithe data would come quite close to the proxy
output index. This index, however, would enable us to detect changes in productive
capacity, rather than the actual output levels. In other words, any ‘real’ growth in tithe
revenues, or for that matter the tax base, would only be indicative of extensive growth

and would reveal little about the intensive pattern, i.e. the productivity gains. This
shortcoming does not detract us from the usefulness o f the tithe data from our vantage
point. As we shall see in the following chapters, under-investment in agriculture was an
important factor, which kept cereal production from recovery during the period under
consideration.30 Hence, it would not be entirely reasonable to assume, ceteris paribus,
that land and labour would be the main determinants of output performance in cereal
production.31 Consequently, we can still use the tithe data as a rough proxy to see trends
in output performance in conjunction with the available population data. The problem is
to account for the de-linkages and use the residual as a proxy to detect trends in output
performance.
The Trends
Despite all the complications involved in its compilation, it is possible to use the
tithe data to delineate trends in output performance. The anticipation here is that, if we
account for the impact o f price changes on the government’s capacity to tax and on the
changes in the rate of taxation, then it will be possible to use the residual tithe data to
delineate trends in output performance.
A typical provincial budget contained detailed information on the tithe (<a§ar).
Usually, the revenue side of the budget cited two important tithe values. The first would
be the levied tax revenues (tahakkukat), or simply the tax base. It is not clear how the
authorities established the tax base, but it seems that they relied mainly on the existing
tax and population registers in combination with the revenues generated over the last
few years, usually the preceding three years, to determine the tax base.32 The second
value cited in the budget was the actual collections o f the current financial year

Quataert, “The Age of Reforms, 1812-1914”, in H. Inalcik and D. Quataert (eds.)

(tahsilat). The difference between the levied value and the actual annual collections
would be the tax in arrears.
Here, I will mainly use the levied tax revenues (tahakkukat), or rather the tax
base, to measure performance in cereal production. The reason for this choice is that,
the levied revenues would ideally be relatively more resilient to short term price and
harvest affects and be a better proxy for estimating trends in output performance.
Besides, given the fact that the authorities used the tax and the population registers as
well as previous tax returns to estimate the tax base, the tahakkukat values better
reflected output potential of the provinces. Actually, the tax base was, in principle, very
close to a lagging three year moving average. That is, the authorities took mainly the
average of the preceding three years’ actual tax revenues in order to estimate the tax
base for any given budgetary year. For example, the tahakkukat value cited in the 1888
budget, was based on the average revenues of 1885-1887, which indicated the level of
“production” in 1886. Thus, output levels would lag two years behind the tahakkukat
values.

Based on the available provincial budgets and the tax data gathered from the
Ottoman archives, I have constructed a series of estimated tithe returns in Selanik for
the period of 1888-1905. The data were extracted mainly from the central state budgets,
provincial yearbooks and archival sources. The data is quite comprehensive and allow
for a structured analysis of long-term trends. I then lagged all the budgetary values by
two years to reach comprehensive revenue series, which would roughly represent the
production trends for 1886-1903. The data is presented in the first column of Table 1.3.

The second step was to construct a price series to deflate the tax base. For this
purpose, I used mainly the price series compiled by Gounaris.33 I completed the missing
observations in his price data by relying on a wide range of sources, including the
provincial newspaper Asir, the Journal o f the Istanbul Chamber o f Commerce, and the
Bulletin Mensuel de la Chambre de Commerce Frangaise de Constantinople. I then
constructed a standard three-year moving average Laspeyres cereal price index. I
included five cereals, wheat, barley, oats, maize and rye, in the commodity basket. The
commodity basket was comprehensive enough to represent changes taking place in
regional cereal prices, for these cereals constituted 88.8% of the total value of regional
cereal production in 1907 (see Table 1.4). I then used the 1907 statistics to determine
33 Gounaris, Steam over Macedonia, 96-97.
36


the weights associated with each crop that was included in the commodity basket.34 The
ensuing computations comprise the data presented in the third column of Table 1.3. I
then adjusted the index to set the reference year at 1886 in order to secure consistency
with the tax data. Deflating the tithe-base series with this adjusted price index, I finally
reached an indicative index o f the ‘real tax base’ for 1886-1903. The resultant index is
presented in the last column of Table 1.3.
According to the figures in Table 1.3, the real tax base kept growing until 1903.
The only exception to the sustained growth of the tithe-base was the exogenous shock of
the 1891-1892 Russian famine, which led to a swift rise in cereal prices in Selanik.35
Otherwise, the upward trend continued uninterrupted.
As it stands, the “real” tax base does not represent the actual trends in output
performance, because it does not account for the government’s changing taxation
capacity and it does not reflect the changes in the rate of taxation. Therefore, the index
must be adjusted further to better represent probable trends in cereal production. In this
regard, measuring the provincial government’s changing taxation capacity offers the
greatest difficulty. I will discuss the taxation practices in Selanik in Chapter 4. Here, it
suffices to mention that the evidence at hand suggests that the terms of tax farming
turned in favour o f the provincial government, especially after the mid-1890s. First, the
provincial government’s administrative capacity and its monitoring and enforcement
powers seem to have improved. Secondly, the partial recovery in cereal prices, the
construction of the Manastir and Istanbul railway lines and the gradual reductions in
railway tariffs seem to have increased the attraction of tax farming in the region. I have
the impression that the tax farming auctions became somewhat more competitive and
better enforced in the latter half of the period covered.
There is one possible way o f measuring the government’s changing capacity to
tax. Ideally, the ratio of actual revenues to the tax base would give us a sense of the
changes in government’s actual capacity to tax; the higher the ratio the better the
enforcement would have been and vice versa. Of course, we would never know if the
changes in the ratio are related to improved taxation or better and more realistic
34 I mainly used the data in Table 1.5. to calculate the weights. The total value o f all products was 226,957,929 kum§es. In that, wheat accounted for 32.4%, barley 18.1%, oats 4%, Rye 11.9% and maize 33.5%. 35 See Chapter-2 for the impact of the Russian famine on local cereal prices.

estimation and planning on behalf of the local authorities. However, the archival
evidence, as I have briefly mentioned above, suggests that a convergence between
actual values and the tax base would be associated more with increasing ‘taxability’
than realistic and accurate planning. Therefore, I assume that the ratio would be a rough
proxy deflator of the “taxation effect”.

Source: Real Tax base is taken from Table 1.3, Column V. Taxation Deflator is based on the tithe figures compiled by S. J. Shaw, “The Nineteenth-Century Ottoman Tax Reforms and Revenue Systems”, International Journal o f Middle East Studies, V. 6, (1975): 421-459.
Data on the actual- tithe revenues (tahsilat) for the province of Selanik are
missing for the post-1896 period. It was not therefore possible to construct a
comprehensive deflator of the “taxation effect” for the entire period under
consideration. In the lack of comprehensive evidence, I consulted Shaw’s tithe data,
which included both the tahsilat and tahakkukat values cited in the budgets of the
central government for the period 1887-1911.36 I mainly used these tahsilat and
tahakkukat values as proxy indicators to calculate the “taxation deflator”. This index is
presented in column two of Table 1.6. The data suggests a steady increase in the overall
taxation capacity of the central government. This observation is in line with our

expectations, as it reflects the positive impact of increasing administrative powers and
the construction of railways on taxation, as indicated above.
I deflated the “Real Tax base” with this “Taxation-Deflator” to reach an index of
the “Real Tax base, Net of Taxation Effect”. The index is presented in the third column
of Table 1.5. As a proxy variable, the “Real Tax base, Net of Taxation Effect” is a bit
closer to an ‘ideal’ measure of the trends in output performance, but still we have not
accounted for the changes in the rate of taxation. There were two increases in the rate of
taxation during our period, one in 1894 and another in 1900 by 20.0% and 0.6%,
respectively.37 This means that we must bring down the 1894-1899 figures by 20% and
the 1900-1903 figures by about 20.7% in total in order to obtain relatively consistent
series. These corrected final values are given in the last column of Table 1.5.
The long-term trend suggested by the final output index confirms our
expectations of steady and swift decline from the late 1880s onwards. The estimated
output index suggests a 24.3% decline in cereal production during 1887-1903. A simple
regression analysis maintains that the output index would have declined further along
the projected trend line and reached 73.1 in 1907. If so, we can suggest that the decline
in cereal production could have been around 27.0% during the period under
consideration.

The rates of decline suggested by the official figures, i.e. 38.8%, and by the
‘fiscal’ estimates, i.e. 27.0%, diverge from each other. Therefore, we need to consider
both estimates jointly to reach a more accurate overall summary estimate. The two
39


estimates are brought together in Table 1.6. The first column of the table simply
reiterates the official estimates presented in Table 1.1. The second column contains
estimated output figures based on the trends suggested by fiscal data. More specifically,
I took the levels of production c.1907 as benchmark and extrapolated the growth figure,
that is 27%, backwards to reach an indicative output estimate for c.1890. Then I took
the average of both estimates to reach the last column of Table 1.6. The summary
figures suggest a notable contraction, by as much as a third, in cereal production during
the 1890s and the early 1900s. Considering the trends suggested by the fiscal estimates,
we could argue that the bulk of this contraction probably took place during the late
1890s and the early 1900s.
1.2. Cash Crop Production
1.2.1. Tobacco and Silk Cocoon Production
Available output statistics on tobacco and silk production are relatively reliable..
The PDA’s close supervision and control of the production, marketing and taxation of
these leading cash crops should enhance the accuracy of the official statistics.38 Besides,
the production o f the two crops concentrated in a number o f leading districts, which
renders the estimation of output levels easier in comparison to cereals that were almost
universally cultivated throughout the region. Therefore, I will be using the official
statistics on tobacco and silk cocoon production liberally to determine trends in output
performance.
I will also use the available foreign trade statistics to outline trends in the
production o f tobacco and silk cocoons. However, there are certain risks associated with
the use of foreign trade statistics. First, this crude method cannot account for the
changes in the level o f domestic consumption and cannot therefore fully represent
trends in output. Secondly, foreign trade statistics used here contain exports originating.
not only from the province of Selanik, but also from the neighbouring Macedonian
provinces o f Kosova and Manastir. Therefore, the export figures reflect only partially
the trends in Selanik’s production. Yet, the exercise is helpful to crosscheck the
37 Akarli, The Problems o fExternal Pressures, 164.
40


reliability of the trends suggested by the official figures. The export orientation of these
products, especially of tobacco, was relatively high. Besides, the province of Selanik
was by far the leading centre for tobacco and silk production in broader Macedonia.
According to the 1907 statistics, Selanik accounted for 71.6% of tobacco production and
92.7% of silk cocoon production in broader Macedonia.39 Therefore, we can reasonably
assume that the export figures can be used as supplementary evidence to ensure the
reliability of the production trends suggested by the official statistics.
Based on the available data, I compiled production and export figures pertaining
to tobacco and silk cocoon production for a number of selected benchmark years
between 1886 and 1912, for which data was available. The data was extracted from a
number of sources, which, included British and French consular reports, the respective
journals of the British and French chambers of commerce in Istanbul, the journal of the
chamber of commerce of Istanbul, the local newspaper Asir, and the 1907 statistics
published by the Ottoman government.

The secular growth trend is quite notable for tobacco production. The production
of the crop seems to have grown rapidly in the region between 1886-1912. In 1886,
See Chapter 2 for PDA’s tight control over tobacco production. Also see Quataert, Ottoman Reform-, Parvus, Turkiye’nin Mali Tarihv, Blaisdell, European Financial Control, E. G. Mears, (ed.)

tobacco production was around 3,378 tons. By 1907, regional tobacco production
yielded 11,570 tons and reached an all time high o f 19,700 tons in 1912. Tobacco
exports also grew over twofold between during 1886-1907 and grew rapidly afterwards
to reach an all time high of 18,889 tons on the eve o f the Balkan wars.
During the same period, the production and exports o f silk cocoons seem to have
also grown, albeit at a relatively modest rate. Output appears to have grown from 1,300
tons in 1890 to 1,643 tons in 1907. Exports also grew from 300 tons in 1886 to 461 tons
in 1912, albeit with considerable fluctuation. After a period of some moderate growth
during 1886-1890, the export performance of the region remained sluggish throughout
the 1890s and made some recovery after the turn of the century. By 1912, silk cocoon
exports reached a high o f 461 tons.
Overall, the production o f both crops appears to have grown steadily during the
period under consideration. The growth of tobacco production in particular is striking
and in comparison the expansion o f silk production appears to have been relatively
limited.
1.2.2. Opium and Cotton Production
Empirical Problems and Alternative Methods o fEstimation
The output statistics on opium and cotton production are less reliable than those
on tobacco and silk cacoons. Similar to the official output estimates pertaining to cereal
production, these statistics were probably based on fiscal data and are not entirely
dependable for the reasons discussed above. Therefore, I will be introducing a more
roundabout method of estimation to help confirm the reliability o f the trends suggested
by available output figures. The following formula summarises the method of
estimation I have adopted: ’
Total Output = (Domestic Consumption) + (Exports - Imports)
There are certain empirical difficulties in using this formula to determine the
levels of opium and cotton production in the region. First, it is not easy to estimate
42


domestic consumption o f cotton because cotton was largely consumed within the region
and the share o f exports in total production remained relatively limited. In the following
sub-section, I will try to estimate levels of domestic cotton consumption for selected
benchmark years.
Second, the estimation of the foreign trade balance entails certain technical
difficulties. The available export figures again comprise total shipments from the port of
Salonica and therefore incorporate the exports originating from the entire Macedonian
hinterland. This empirical drawback, however, does not appear to be entirely prohibitive
for estimating the levels of cotton production. According to the 1907 statistics, Selanik
accounted for 95.7% of all Macedonian cotton production.40 Therefore, we can
confidently assume that the bulk o f exported cotton came from Selanik during the
period under consideration. The problem is slightly more complex for opium. The
province of Kosova was the leading centre of poppy cultivation in broader Macedonia
and the best quality opium for export came from the district o f I§tip in southern Kosova.
The 1907 statistics suggest that about 52.6% of Macedonian opium production took
place in Kosova, while Selanik accounted for about 46.8% of the total.41 Since the
available export figures can only be representative of production trends in broader
Macedonia, using the Macedonian output figures as a proxy to determine production
trends in Selanik appears to be a reasonable approach. Surely, this approach is not
entirely satisfactory, for it .does not allow for a robust analysis o f the changes taking
place in the level of opium production in the Selanik region. Yet, the compactness of
opium produce, the relative insignificance of transportation costs associated with the
marketing o f opium, and the greater degree of integration in broader Macedonian opium
markets allow us, albeit cautiously, to infer trends in regional opium production from
those pertaining to broader Macedonia.
Cotton Production
Estimating levels of cotton production based on the consumptionist approach
entails difficulties of a more specific nature. The ‘external’ balance can easily be

43


calculated, because the trade figures are available and we know that the bulk o f exports
originated from the cotton producing districts of Selanik. As I have noted above, the
main difficulty lies with the estimation o f the levels of local consumption. Local cotton
consumption had two components in the region, namely home/household and factory
consumption. We know that rural household production of hand-spun yam survived
well into the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, despite the strong
competition of European and local factories.42 However, it is very difficult to guess
exactly how much cotton was produced and consumed for domestic purposes. A
contemporary report on cotton production in Selanik prepared by the chief agricultural
inspector, Vitalis Efendi, sheds some light on the issue. Vitalis estimated that about
2,700 tons of cotton was consumed within the vilayet of Selanik in 1903. O f that sum,
130 tons, or about 5%, were used for household consumption.43
Vitalis’ estimate of household consumption was probably impressionistic.
Besides, his estimates pertain to 1903 and reveal nothing about the share of household
consumption for earlier years. My impression is that, relative “de-industrialisation” and
the retreat o f cotton spinning deep into the countryside took place earlier, in the 1850s
and 1860s, owing much to the rapid penetration of cheap European yams into domestic
markets. Hand spinning was gradually pushed backed into the confines of rural self
sufficiency and had become a Chayanovian endeavour in the countryside by the
1870s.44 The situation probably did not change much during the 1880s and the 1890s.
As suggested by Vitalis’ report, women continued to support the household economy by
spinning and weaving as they did in the past. I assume that the share o f cotton
consumption for household purposes remained relatively unimportant and more or less
retained its relatively small share in total consumption. Rather than using Vitalis’
impressionistic estimates, I chose to remove household consumption altogether from the
computations.

The ‘factory’ component of ‘domestic consumption’ is somewhat easier to
estimate. Contemporary observers showed great interest in the proliferation of spinning
mills throughout the region. These observers frequently cited estimates of cotton yam
manufactured in local mills. Recently, Palairet compiled the available figures and
produced a comprehensive output series pertaining to mechanised cotton yam
production in Selanik.45 I relied mostly on Palairet’s yam output estimates as a proxy
for factory consumption of cotton. The main difficulty was to determine how much
cotton input was needed on average to produce a certain quantity of cotton yam of
lower counts. As a rough estimate, I used the input/output figures given by the British
consular assistant in Salonica, Mr. Du Vallon. Du Vallon argued that “[one of] the
spinning [mills] in Salonica produced about 160,000 bales of 10 lbs. [of cotton yam],
for which 2,000,000 lbs. of cotton were necessary”.46 Accordingly, I simply multiplied
the yam output figures of Palairet by a coefficient of 1.25 to reach a rough estimate of
factory consumption of raw cotton, which, in this case, also represents the total
domestic consumption of cotton. I then estimated the levels of cotton production for
selected benchmark years by adding the foreign trade balance to the consumption
figures. The estimates are presented in Table 1.8. In the last column of the same table, I
also give the available official estimates of cotton production.

The broad trend in regional cotton production seems to have been rapid
expansion during the 1880s, followed by a period of relative slowdown during the early
1890s and a swift decline, perhaps by as much as 28%, in the late 1890s and the early
1900s. The contraction in regional cotton production seems to have slowed down during
the late 1900s and the early 1910s. Yet, the sector failed to recovery, as indicated by the
estimated level of regional cotton production on the eve of the Balkan wars, which
remained below that of 1895 by as much as a third.
Opium Production
Table 1.9 presents the available output and export figures pertaining to
Macedonian opium production for selected benchmark years. The output data was based
on official figures extracted mainly from British consular reports, as well as on the
official statistics published by the Ottoman government in 1890 and 1907. The export
figures were extracted from Gounaris.47

Both estimates suggest steady growth in output during the 1880s, followed by a
period of rapid growth during the 1890s and early 1900s. This expansionary period was
followed by a brief interval of retardation and a partial recovery in the mid-late 1900s,

respectively. Yet, the recovery was only partial and still lagging behind the peak level
reached in 1902 by the end of the period under consideration.
These figures represent the trends in opium production for Macedonia in general
and not those in Selanik as such. However, due to the above mentioned peculiarities in
opium production it is reasonable to assume that the broad direction of the regional and
Macedonian opium production ran parallel. Therefore, I conclude that opium production
expanded rapidly throughout the region during the 1880s and the 1890s and
subsequently went into a period of relative retardation during the early 1900s.
1.3. Animal Husbandry
Two primary sources can be used to gauge the performance of the sector during
the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries. The first, and indeed the primary,
source is the official statistics on animal husbandry published by the Ottoman
government. These statistics are readily available in various provincial almanacs
(salnames) and the official 1907 agricultural statistics. Also fiscal data can be used quite
productively to cross check and confirm the trends suggested by the official output
estimates. The fiscal data pertaining to animal taxes, mainly the sheep tax (agnam
vergisi) and the pig tax (canavar vergisi), can be extracted from the annual budgets of
the provincial government. In what follows, I will first discuss the nature of my sources
and point to their relative weaknesses and strengths. Having made the necessary
technical reservations, I will use both data sets, particularly the official output statistics,
to delineate broad trends in sectoral performance during the period under consideration.
The most important piece o f evidence contained in the official statistics is the
number o f farm animals that existed within the boundaries o f the province. It is not
exactly clear how the authorities estimated this number. Most likely, they used a
combination of local tax-registers and the records of local councils and the chambers of
commerce and agriculture. The data published in the salnames appear to have been
based on these sources. The numbers cited in the 1907 agricultural statistics probably
were based on a combination of local tax registers, the reports of the appointed survey
committees, and the records o f the local chambers of commerce and agriculture. All of
these estimates contain an indeterminate margin of error. The difficulty of keeping full
47


account o f the constantly changing number of farm animals in a large province with a
total surface area of 36,000 square kilometres must have undermined the accuracy of the
official estimates.
Despite their shortcomings, the data at hand can still be used to establish broad
trends in sectoral performance. The fiscal origins of the available statistics do not appear
to be as problematic as they are in the cases of cereals and some of the cash crops.
Animal taxes were collected directly by the salaried officials of the government. These
tax collectors cooperated with local village headmen, the estate owners, and members of
the local councils, and other prominent individuals to set the number of animals that
would be subject to taxation in each village or estate. The parties then determined
jointly the average annual revenue to be generated from the keeping of these farm
animals. The expected revenue thus determined simply set the tax base. The village
commune, or the estate owner, was then obliged to pay, in cash, a certain percentage of
the tax base as sheep, pig and farm animal tax to the appointed tax collectors.48
Available historical sources maintain that the authorities managed to collect the
due animal taxes on time. The participation of local agents in the collection of these
taxes, the simplicity of the method o f taxation, and the clarity with which the specific
fiscal obligations o f the village commune were set were important factors that
contributed to the prompt collection of animal taxes, without leaving much in arrears.
According to the available budgetary figures, the government officers managed to
collect over 95% of the expected animal tax revenues 49 This situation indicates that the
official estimates o f the number of animals kept within the boundaries of each province,
and hence, the official figures published in the salnames were relatively accurate,
particularly for the pre-1900 period. Besides, the reports of local chambers of commerce
and agriculture probably increased the accuracy of the ‘fiscal’ estimates included in the
provincial salnames. In the following analysis, I will be using the statistics published in
the salnames for the years 1876 and 1890s. Data published in the salnames of other
years were largely incomplete and partial, and the data pertaining to these two years
constitute, by far, the best series available for the province.

Apparently, the data contained in the salnames are not equally reliable for the
post-1900 period. My research in the Ottoman archives suggests that the local
authorities encountered some difficulty in the collection of animal taxes after the turn of
the century. Mounting political instability in the countryside and the intensification of
the militant activities of the bands operating in the region, particularly in highland
districts where animal husbandry was prominent, posed a serious threat for appointed
tax collectors. Apprehensive of life-threatening attacks by bandits and the constant
danger of being kidnapped by them, the appointed tax collectors often demanded
protection from the local gendarmerie garrisons. In most instances, the local authorities
failed to appoint guards to accompany the tax collectors, mainly because of the lack of
funds to meet the extra costs of such protection. Under the circumstances, many officers
refused to collect the tax dues in distant mountainous districts.50 Consequently, the
animal tax revenues accruing to the provincial government contracted notably in the
post-1900 period. The figures presented in Table 1.10 suggest a 30% contraction in the

animal taxes accruing to the provincial government during 1900-1908. Clearly, adverse
political conditions underlined this notable contraction in government revenue. More
importantly, these adverse circumstances, especially growing tax evasion, probably
claimed much from the accuracy of the ‘fiscal’ estimates published in the salnames.
The 1907 statistics, as I have noted, were less fiscal in origin and were based on
the detailed information provided by the specialist statistical survey committees, as well
as by the local chambers of commerce and agriculture. Hence, the official agricultural
statistics can be used with little reservation to determine the number of farm animals in
the post-1900 period.
Table 1.11.

The data presented in Table 1.11 suggest considerable growth in the number of
farm animals during the period under consideration. The rise in the number of the most
important farm animals such as cows, buffaloes, beasts of burden, sheep, donkeys and
mules is quite striking. In this period, we observe a 109.9% increase in the number of
cows, buffaloes and beasts, 70.2% in goats, 97.8% in donkeys and mules, 87.4% in
horses and 36.3% in sheep. Only the number of pigs seems to have declined during this
period. Looking at the fiscal data in Table 1.10, we can suggest, albeit cautiously, that
this growth in animal numbers was relatively moderate during the 1890s. Animal tax
revenues increased by about 8.0% during 1890-1900. Therefore, it is very likely that the
bulk of growth took place in the post-1900 period. At any rate, we can confidently
presume that animal husbandry assumed increasing importance in the regional economy
during the period under consideration, with probable trend acceleration after c.1890.

2. Overall Trends in Agricultural Production
Our analysis so far has concentrated on the performance of the primary sub
sectors of the agrarian economy. The discussion yielded a highly complex picture of the
agricultural sector in the Selanik region during the period under consideration. Cereal
production was seriously retarded and contracted by as much as a third, in contrast to
the growing dynamic sub-sectors, namely tobacco, silk, opium and cotton production.
The expansion of tobacco production in particular was quite spectacular and grew by
over 400.0% during 1886-1912. Overall, therefore, we observe the emergence of a
“dual” agriculture structure in the region, whereby dynamic and retarded sub-sectors
coexisted in apparent contrast.
In this section, we turn our attention to the broader picture and discuss overall
production trends in the agricultural sector. Again, I use a number of different sources.
and employ various methods of estimation to assure reliability and accuracy in the
estimates. First, I will use official data pertaining to the area under cultivation and the
value o f agricultural output in order to measure the changes taking place in the overall
level o f agricultural production. Secondly, I will use available demographic data to
determine the changing importance o f the agricultural sector in the broader regional
economy during the period under consideration. Once this exercise is complete, then we
shall be in a position to discuss the direction, pattern and timing of the shifts taking
place in the agrarian sector as well as in the broader regional economy.
2.1. Changing Levels of Agricultural Production
Statistics on the area o f agricultural land under cultivation can be extracted from
the provincial yearbooks {salnames) and the 1907 statistics. In our case, the salname
pertaining to 1890 and the 1907 statistics contain comprehensive data on the area of
land under cultivation for most crops produced in the Selanik region. These crops
include primary cereals, leading cash crops, grapes, as well as other less important, if
significant, products, such as sesame, rice and leguminous products. Both sets of
statistics also contain estimates of the total area of land under cultivation in the region
(See Table 1.12).
51


The aggregate data, namely the total area of land under cultivation, could not
constitute a reliable basis for discussing overall trends in agricultural production, due to
the apparent categorical inconsistencies that existed between the two data sets. More
specifically, it is not exactly clear what the category of ‘others’ entailed in the 1890
statistics. This drawback claims much from the comparability of the two estimates and
undermines the reliability of comparative static analysis. I, therefore, decided to use
categorical data in order to secure consistency. I simply added the available figures on
cereals, cash crops, rice and leguminous products and vineyards to reach more coherent
estimates of the area of land under cultivation for the two benchmark years. These
leading products consistently accounted for at least 77.0% of the agricultural land under
cultivation, and, therefore, the categorical aggregates could be representative of the
broad trends taking place in agricultural production. The ensuing data is presented in the
last row of Table 1.12.

Notes: For 1907 ‘Others’ include ‘rice, sesame and leguminous crops. ‘Others’ are not defined in the 1890 statistics. Also see Text.
The estimates presented in Table 1.12 suggest a considerable (36.2%)
contraction in the total area of land under cultivation. The estimates also maintain the
relative resilience of wheat and maize production and the dynamism of tobacco
production in the region. At any rate the contraction in the production of field crops
cannot be seriously disputed. Therefore, ceteris paribus, we should anticipate a
52


contraction in the agricultural sector at large and an associated decline in its
contribution to the broader regional economy.
The data presented in Table 1.12, however, does not take into consideration the
contribution of animal husbandry and sericulture to agricultural production. In the
previous section I have maintained the dynamism and growth of these sub-sectors and
hinted at the possibility of their rising importance in the Selanik region during this
period. Therefore, it is imperative to employ alternative methods of estimation that
would reflect the changes in the level of agricultural production. In addition, such an
effort should help to test the accuracy of the data presented in Table 1.12.

Notes: 1) In the calculation of figures pertaining to wool, goat’s hair and milk, I have assumed that a sheep yielded 1 okka (or 1,283 kg) of wool annually, a goat 0.5 okka of goat’s hair, and cows, buffaloes and beasts yielded 90 okka of milk annually. I also assumed that 60% of all beasts were female. The assumptions were based on the figures given in the 1890 yearbook. 1307 S.V.S., 1890, 47-50. 2) The price data published in the 1907 statistics were used in computations. Weights were taken from the respectively from the 1890 yearbook and the 1907 statistics.
The data presented in Table 1.13 suggest that the total value of agricultural
production declined by 31.0%, measured in 1907 prices, in the Selanik region during
1890-1907. In other words, the positive contribution of cash crop production and animal
husbandry was wiped out by the massive contraction in the primary sector of the
53


agrarian economy, namely cereal production. It is very likely that the contribution of
agriculture to the regional economy at large was much smaller in 1910 than it was two
decades prior. This contention is also supported by demographic data, which suggests
considerable de-population in rural areas, particularly from the turn of the twentieth
century onwards.
2.2. Demographic Trends
2.2.1 Regional Population. The Overall Trends
The Ottoman authorities showed considerable interest in registering, updating
and systematically publishing population figures throughout the nineteenth century. A .
number o f population censuses were carried out starting from the early 1830s. The early
population censuses were limited both in terms of their scope and content and were
primarily intended to register the tax-paying (male) population and to keep proper
account of the adult Muslim men obliged to serve in the Ottoman armies. Unfortunately,
most of these early censuses could not be completed in many provinces and the results
remained confined largely to a few leading provinces.51
More comprehensive population counts were carried out during the Hamidian
period, one in 1885 and the other in 1907. The surveys were carried out in all provinces
of the Empire and all citizens were counted. These censuses were much more detailed
than anything that preceded them and contained elaborate information on almost all
aspects of demographic life, such as plain population figures pertaining to each and
every district (kaza), the marital status, age, gender, ethnic background, occupation and
birthplace o f each individual. The Ottoman government published the information
gathered in these censuses. In addition, the local authorities regularly published
population estimates in the provincial almanacs (salnames). The data contained in the
salnames probably were based on the population censuses and updated according to the
local population registers kept by the provincial bureaucracy.52
See S. J. Shaw “The Ottoman Census System and Population, 1831-1914,” International Journal o fMiddle East Studies, 9, (1975): 325-338; Karpat, Ottoman Population. 52 See Shaw “ The Ottoman Census System”; Karpat, Ottoman Population.
54


In what follows, I use both sources to quantify the demographic changes in
Selanik. However, it must be noted that these statistics contain certain weaknesses. The
first weakness is the general under-counting and the second is the apparent under
recording of the female population. Recently, Michael Palairet controlled for some of
these weaknesses and produced alternative “corrected” estimates pertaining to the
European provinces o f the Empire. These estimates constitute the best data current
available. Here, I will use Palairet’s corrected estimates for the province of Selanik for
the years 1885,1896 and 1906.53
I also estimate the population of the province for two more benchmark years,
1876 and 1912. However, the data must be adjusted to secure consistency with
Palairet’s figures. For this, we must briefly consider Palairet’s method of correction.
First, Palairet maintains that it is necessary to make an 8.0% upwards adjustment over
official figures to account for general under-counting. However, Palairet refrains from
adopting a different margin of error for pre-1885 data and uses the 8.0% margin
throughout.54 Palairet’s reservation is justified, as there is no way o f accounting for the
degree o f improvement in the accuracy o f censuses. Clearly, this reservation
undermines the comparability of the early and later population estimates. Yet, the
reservation is necessary to avoid any arbitrary distortion in the data set.
Secondly, Palairet accounts for the actual imbalance between male and female
populations. The conventional method adopted by contemporaries was simply to double
the male population reported in the censuses and the provincial registers to construct
overall population figures. Palairet contests the accuracy of this method on the basis of
his own research, as well as that of Todorova and Karpat. He maintains that there was
an actual and persistent surplus o f male population in the Balkan provinces of the
Empire.55 He suggests tentatively that it is necessary to make a downward adjustment of
4.2% in population estimates reached by doubling the male population, so as to account
for the “real” excess of male population over females in the Macedonian provinces for
the pre-1885 period.

Our data pertaining to 1876 comes from the official yearbook of that year. The
yearbook reports 393,029 male residents for 1876.56 Following Palairet’s correction
technique, I have estimated the provincial population at 813,287 in 1876.57 This is
probably an underestimate, because, as I have noted, the 8.0% upward adjustment
suggested by Palairet might not be sufficient to fully account for the under-counting
inherent in these early population figures. Nevertheless, I maintain the estimate to
assure consistency within our data set.

I have extracted the population data for 1911 from the official figures published
by the Ministry of Commerce and Agriculture. According to the raw figures, the total
population of the province, was 1,103,000 in 1911.58 In this case, however, there was no
need to account for the ‘gender bias’, as the data were based on all-inclusive censuses,
where both the male and the female population was systematically counted.
Nevertheless, in line with Palairet, I made an 8% upwards adjustment over the official
statistics, to account for any general under-counting, which may have remained in these
56 1293 S.V.S., 1876,45.
57 I first adjusted 393,029 upward by 8%, and reached an official estimate of 424,471.1multiplied this number by two to estimate regional population, 848,943. Then, I accounted for the gender bias and brought this figure down by 4.2% to reach 813,287.

more comprehensive censuses. Thus, I estimated the population o f Selanik at around
1,191,000 in this period.59
These calculations yield relatively comprehensive and consistent population
estimates for the two benchmark years under consideration. These estimates are
presented together with Palairet’s estimates pertaining to the years of 1885, 1897 and
1906 in Table 1.14. The estimates suggest rapid population growth during 1876-1885,
followed by a period of notable slowdown in 1885-1897, and a clear decline during
1897-1906. We observe quite a remarkable recovery after 1906. Within a matter of five
years the regional population grew by 19.7% in total, at an annual rate o f 3.7%, and
reached an all time high of 1,191,000 on the eve of the Balkan Wars.
The erratic fluctuation of the population during the period under consideration
calls for some historical explanation. The rapid growth o f regional population during the
period 1876-1885 must be attributed partly to the feebleness o f the 1876 population
estimate. As I have noted above, the 1876 estimate is not entirely reliable and is
probably an underestimate. However, 3.1% annual growth rate cannot be attributed
entirely to technical problems, no matter what the margin o f error in the 1876 estimates
might have been.60 Historical evidence corroborates this impression and points to
certain factors that might have triggered the rapid growth in the region’s population
during the 1870s and the early 1880s.
The waves of migration that hit the region in the aftermath of the Russo
Ottoman war of 1876 must have played an important, if not the primary, role in this
regard. Thousands of Muslim families fleeing from Bulgaria, Romania and the
Caucuses found refuge in the Macedonian provinces in the aftermath of the war. The
Ottoman government sent some o f these migrant families to the Anatolian provinces;
however, it seems many were settled in Selanik.61 The Ottoman government provided
59 J. McCarthy, The Arab World, Turkey and the Balkans (1878-1914): A Handbook o fHistorical Statistics, (Boston, MA, 1982),' 283. McCarthy estimates the residents for the province of Selanik to be 1,347,915. However, his correction method is not consistent with that o f Palairet and is not sensitive to the “actual” inequality between male and female populations. Therefore, in order to maintain consistency within my series I have used Palairet’s method to correct the existing official estimates.
60 Ottoman annual rate of population growth stood at an average o f around 0.8% during the late nineteenth century and the early twentieth centuries (Eldem, Osmanli Imparatorlugu’nun iktisadi $ artlari, 23).
61 See N. ipek, Rumeli’den Anadolu’ya Turk Gogleri, 1877-1890, [Turkish Immigration from Rumelia to Anatolia, 1877-1890] (Ankara: Turk Tarih Kuramu Basimevi, 1992), for the migration of
57


land, accommodation, seeds, draft animals and cash allowances for these refugees and
helped them settle in the province.62 Although it is not possible to determine their
number, the new settlers’ contribution to the growth of the regional population must
have been significant.
We observe a relative stagnation in the region’s population from 1885-1897.
This stagnation can be attributed to outward migration. Following the cessation of
Thessaly to Greece in 1885, many Greek peasant farmers left Macedonian provinces
and sought their fortunes in,Thessaly as farmers and agricultural workers. Although it is
not possible to determine the scope of this migration, it seems to have reached such a
level as to cause acute labour shortages throughout the Macedonian countryside. Mostly
likely, Selanik was not an exception.63
1897-1906 was a period o f unprecedented depopulation in the region. During
this nine-year period, regional population declined by an average of 1.0% per annum.
Again, large-scale demographic movements explain this swift contraction. This period
witnessed mass emigration from Macedonian provinces, due to complex reasons, which
will be studied in detail in the following chapters. However, for now it suffices to say
that a combination o f economic and political factors seem to have encouraged many
unfortunate peasant farmers to migrate abroad, particularly to the United States.
Adverse price trends and successive crop failures, an increasing rural tax-burden,
regressive taxation practices and growing indebtedness followed by dispossession seem
to have underlay the process of emigration.64 Also, mounting political instability in the
region, particularly after the turn of the century, seems to have compelled many peasant
families to emigrate abroad.65

The exact words of the British Consul General Blunt are worth while citing: “Since the cessation of Thessaly to Greece, more than two-thirds o f the Mussulmans of that country have emigrated chiefly to Anatolia. They are becoming replaced by Christian peasants from Macedonia, where farm labourers are getting scarcer and dearer every year”. 64 For details see Chapters 2 and 4.

Finally, the post-1906 years witnessed the reversal of demographic trends in the
region; we observe rapid recovery in regional population. At this time, however, certain
political factors seem to have underscored this increase. The growing ethnic tensions in
the Macedonian provinces erupted into wide spread political instability throughout the
Balkans during this period.66 Many Muslim families still residing in Bulgaria sought
refuge in Ottoman lands. Most of these immigrant families were sent to the Anatolian
provinces; but again many chose to stay in Selanik, particularly in the relative security
of the proliferating urban areas of the region. These refugees explain much of the
population growth from 1906-1911.
Overall, we observe that the population o f the region fluctuated around the
1,000,000 benchmark during the period under consideration. Processes of emigration
from and immigration to the region largely underscored the fluctuations in regional
population. In the next section, we turn our attention to the changes taking place in the
composition o f regional population and its distribution between urban and rural areas.
2.2.2. Rural and Urban Population. Changing Balances
Existing research on Ottoman demographic history suggests that the late
nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries constituted a period of rapid urbanisation in
Selanik and other European provinces o f the Empire. According to Palairet’s figures,
the number of people living in towns with more than 2,000 people totalled 325,000 in
1895, or 28.9% of the population o f the province in 1895.67 Georgeon suggests that the
urban population grew steadily throughout the 1890s and the early 1900s and reached
456,000 in 1906. Since the population o f the province was 995,000 in 1906, Georgeon’s

Dakin,” Book Review, Balkan Studies, 10, (1969): 218-220; H. N. Brailsford, Macedonia, Its Races and Their Future, (London, 1906); D. Dakin, The Greek Struggle in Macedonia, 1897-1913, (Salonica, 1966); B. Jelavich, History o f the Balkans, V. 2, Twentieth Century, 1. P. (1983), (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994); L. S.

Uzer, Makedonya E§kiyalik Tarihi ve Son Osmanh Yonetimi [History o f Banditry in Macedonia and the Last Ottoman Administration] (Ankara: Turk Tarih Kurumu, 1979).
67 There appears to be some inconsistency in Palairet’s data. Palairet estimates the population of the Selanik province to be 1,091,000 in 1896 (Palairet, The Balkan Economies, 13). If so, the urban population, i.e. 325,000, would account for 29.8% of the provincial population. However, Palairet, based on Vasil K’nchov, puts the rate of urbanisation at 27.9% (Palairet, The Balkan Economies, 26).
59


figure indicates that the urban population rose rapidly during the 1890s and the early
1900s to reach 45.8% o f the total in 1906.68
Palairet and Georgeon, however, do not provide information on the earlier years
of 1876-1895 or the later years of 1906-1912. In order to make up for this deficiency, I
compiled urban population estimates for four benchmark years, i.e. 1876, 1894, 1906
and 1912. Two primary sources were used in the compilation o f the series. The first
source was the provincial almanacs published by the Ottoman government, which
regularly reported the population of the towns and/or the number o f residential buildings
located in each town.69 I primarily used the. population figures to compile the series.
However, for certain years and for some towns no population estimates were available.
To get around this problem, I used the number of residential buildings as a proxy for
determining the population of any ‘missing’ town at any given point in time. I assumed;
a) that each household contained an average of five persons and b) that only one
household resided in each residential building.70 Accordingly, I simply multiplied the
number o f residential dwellings by a coefficient of five to reach indicative estimates of
urban population. I relied on this crude method of estimation especially for the
population figures of 1876. Nevertheless, it was still impossible to estimate the
population of ten towns due to a total lack of evidence. The available data pertaining to
1894 and 1906 were relatively comprehensive and yielded population estimates for all
towns listed in the provincial almanacs. These estimates are presented in the first three
columns o f Table 1.15.
The estimation o f urban population for 1912 posed greater difficulties. Since no
almanacs were published after 1908, I had to rely on contemporary British consular
reports.71 The data contained in the consular reports were relatively limited,

70 See A. Duben, and C. Behar, Istanbul Haneleri, Evlilik, Aile ve Dogurganhk, 1880-1940 [Istanbul Households, Marriage, Family and Fertility, 1880-1940], (Istanbul: Ileti§im Yaymlan, 1996), 61-75; M. Todorova, “Population Structure”. Studies of Duben and'Behar, and Todorova maintain that urban families were predominantly ‘nuclear’. Duben and Behar also estimate 4.7 persons for the average Muslim family in Istanbul in the early twentieth century. Todorova maintains that five member households were the most representative in North-Eastern Bulgaria, c.1850. The data presented in Appendix 2 appears to be in tune with Todorova and Duben and Behar’s findings. The relatively comprehensive 1906 statistics suggest that the average household size in the province of Selanik was 5.5. Excluding the town o f Salonica, we reach an average of 5.1 persons per household. Thus, it seems to be safe to assume five persons per household. 71 F.O.A.S., 1913, N. 5234: 3-4.
60


incorporating the population of only the main towns, namely Salonica, Tikve§,
Karaferye, Gevgeli, Vodine, Siroz, Drama and Kavala. No estimates of residential
buildings were cited. The towns mentioned in the British consular reports accounted for
about 75% o f the entire urban population o f the province that was reported in the 1906
almanac. Although 75% is considerably high, leaving the remaining 25% out of our
calculations would have seriously undermined the comparability o f the 1912 estimates
with the earlier ones. In order to bring the British data up to par with the previous
observations, I assumed that the population of unrecorded towns remained unchanged
between 1906 and 1912. Accordingly, I carried the 1906 figures over to 1912. This is
not an entirely arbitrary assumption to make, because both in the primary sources and
the available secondary literature, 1906-1912 appears as a period of rapid urban
growth.72 Similarly, there is no qualitative evidence to suggest significant de
urbanisation in any part of the region. Therefore, if anything, our estimates must be
considered conservative and understate the scope o f urbanisation as of 1912. In other
words, the data was adjusted against the hypothesis to be tested, i.e. rapid urban growth.
Another difficulty arose from the nature o f the official statistics. The almanacs
reported statistics pertaining to towns which were sub-provincial (kaza) government
centres. Therefore, several towns o f economic and demographic significance could not
be included in the data set. For instance, Agustos (Nausta), which was an important
manufacturing centre with a population o f over 10,000 at the time, went unreported.
More importantly perhaps, several towns with populatipns between 2,000 and 5,000
could not be included due to a lack of evidence.

Despite the above-mentioned problems, the available data does allow for a
careful analysis of broad trends of urbanisation in the region. The estimates are
particularly comprehensive for towns above the 5,000 benchmark and include all
primary urban centres in the region, save Agustos. In fact, focusing on these larger
towns improves the internal consistency of our data set. More specifically, focusing on
towns with a population of 5,000 and above moderates the problem of ‘missing’ and
‘carry-over’ towns in the 1876 and 1912 estimates. According to this criterion, only
Drama and possibly Kavala and Cuma-i Bala appear “missing” in the 1876 series. In
order to overcome this deficiency and to bring the 1876 estimates categorically on par
62


with the later estimates, I first calculated the percentage share of these three towns in the
total population o f the towns above 5,000 in 1894. The associated share was 9.9%. I
then adjusted the initial 1876 (total) estimates upward by this rate to reach an indicative
estimate of urban population for the same year. Both initial values and adjusted
estimates (in parentheses) are given in Table 1.15.
Concentrating on more sizeable towns also enabled me to reduce somewhat the
degree o f reliance on the “carry-over” towns for the 1912 estimate. According to the
5,000 criterion, the ‘carry-over’ towns that appear in the 1912 series are as follows:
Istrumca, Toyran, Avrethisan, Yenice, Petri?, Cuma-i Bala and Nevrekop. These towns
accounted for 16.3% o f the urban population (5,000 and above) in 1906. As has been
noted, the share o f ‘carry-over’ towns was 25.0% before the application of the 5,000
criterion.
Admittedly, a narrower urban focus comes at an analytical cost. By leaving out
the smaller towns, we loose an important dimension o f urban growth in the region. One
possible way o f measuring the ‘loss* can be established through a simple comparison
between our 1894 and 1906 estimates and those of Palairet and Georgeon, which
include towns with more than 2000 residents. According to the estimates presented in
Table 1.15, the rate o f urbanisation as measured by the population o f all towns above
5000 stood around 16.0% in 1896 and 24.0% in 1906. As already noted, Palairet and
Georgeon estimate the rate o f urbanisation to be 29.0% in 1894 and 43.0% in 1906
respectively. Thus, by leaving out smaller towns, we fail to account for a considerable
part o f the urban dynamic generated within the region. However, larger towns
apparently accounted for the bulk o f urban growth in the region. Therefore, it seems
sensible to suggest that the more sizeable towns can constitute a solid basis for
discussing trends in urbanisation. In what follows, we will concentrate exclusively on
these larger towns.
The data presented in Table 1.15 suggest that urban population grew at an
average rate o f 3.1% per annum in the province between 1876 and 1911. The rate of
‘urbanisation’ rose almost' threefold during the same period and reached an estimated
29.0% on the eve o f the Balkan Wars. By the end of the period, the region was certainly
more urbanised than ever before. More importantly perhaps, the rate o f urbanisation in
the Selanik region was considerably higher than anywhere else in the Balkans. In the
63.


mid-1870s Selanik was slightly more urbanised than other Balkan regions. For instance,
in the late 1870s and the early 1880s, the rate of urbanisation (including towns above
2.000) was 22.4% in Eastern Rumelia, 18.5% in Greece and 17.2% in Northern
Bulgaria. At around the same time, the rate of urbanisation (including towns above
5.000) was 15.0% in Selanik. It is not easy to determine exactly how Selanik compared
with these Balkan regions in the 1890s and the 1990s, due to differences in the criterion,
used to measure the respective rates o f urbanisation. However, it is very likely that the
overall urbanisation rate in Selanik compared equally with these Balkan regions and
possibly stood somewhere around 20.0%.73 By 1911, undoubtedly Selanik was more
urbanised than any other Balkan region. For instance, in 1910, the rate of urbanisation
(above 2000) was 24.0% in Greece, 21.7% in Eastern Rumelia, 18.8% in Bulgaria,
18.0% in Romania, 13.0% in Bosnia-Hercegovina and 10.8% in Serbia.74 All these rates
fall short o f Selanik’s 29.0%, which only includes towns above 5,000. In this sense, the
urban gap between Selanik and the rest o f the Balkans seem to have widened during the
period under consideration. The reasons for this rapid urbanisation constitutes a central
theme throughout the following chapters. For now, however, it is important to note that
this rapid urbanisation was underscored by a notable de-population of rural areas at
large. After a considerable rise following the Russo-Ottoman War of 1876, rural
population declined steadily throughout the late 1890s and the early 1900s to reach.
733,750 in 1906. After this date, it seems rural population rose again by about 11.5%
and reached 817,937 in 1912. It is important to remember that this level is somewhat
exaggerated due to the probable underestimation of the urban population during this
later period. Even so, it seems the rural population either remained constant or grew
only very little during 1906-1912.
The demographic data I have so far considered are in conformity with the
agricultural trends outlined above. The estimated 11.5% decline in rural population in
Selanik during 1896 and 1906 is in conformity with the 26.0% contraction in the area of
agricultural land under cultivation and the 31.4% decline in the total value of
agricultural production between 1890-1906. Clearly, the agricultural sector was
contracting during the 1890s and the early 1900s.
73 The share of all Reported towns in regional population was 21% in 1876 (See Table-2). 74 Lampe and Jackson, Balkan Economic History, 240; Palairet, The Balkan Economies, 26.


Conclusion
The discussion so far has shown that 1885-1910 was a period of serious
retardation in the agricultural sector in the Selanik region. Agricultural production
probably contracted by about 25% during this period. However, retardation and decline
were not manifest in all sub-sectors of the agrarian economy. It took place mainly in
cereal production, especially in the production of non-staple cereals. There were,
however, other sub-sectors, which were dynamic and grew steadily throughout the
period. The growth o f sericulture, animal husbandry and especially of tobacco
production are cases in point. Yet, the dynamism and growth of these sectors could not
keep up with the swift contraction in cereal production and the sector in general
contracted steadily during the period under consideration. Thus, in the process of overall
agrarian decline, a dual agrarian structure emerged in the region, whereby dynamic and
retarded sectors coexisted in growing contrast.
Another important point that should be underlined is that the trends in Selanik
appear quite different from those in Ottoman agriculture in general. As I have noted
above, the output estimates put forth by Eldem suggest considerable dynamism and
growth in Ottoman agriculture during 1889-1907. According to his figures, Ottoman
agricultural production grew by about 27.5% during this period, a growth rate, which
stands in stark contrast to the sluggish performance o f the Selanik region. More
interestingly, the output estimates produced by Eldem suggest growth in almost all
compartments o f the agrarian economy, including cereal production, which according to
Eldem grew by as much as 50% during the same period.75 This also stands in contrast to
our diagnosis of retardation in the Selanik region.
In the following chapters, I will discuss the conjunctural and structural reasons
that retarded the growth of the agricultural sector in Selanik. These factors include
adverse price trends, intense foreign competition in both overseas and increasingly in
domestic markets, high transaction costs, certain market failures, ineffectiveness of
government policy and adverse harvest trends brought on by poor weather conditions.
However, most o f these factors can not explain the acute divergence in agricultural
performance. The impression I get from the existing literature is that farmers throughout
75 Eldem, Osmanli Imparatorlugu ’nun Iktisadi $artlari, 37.
65


the Empire suffered from similar problems during the same period. It seems the
variances in the success of government policy could explain some of the divergence in
agricultural performance. As I shall discuss in Chapter 3, government’s reform efforts
yielded limited success and materialised only towards the end of the period, and, in
general, they failed to bring the desired effect in modernisation and growth in the
Selanik region. In contrast, reform efforts yielded noteworthy success and supported
processes o f agricultural growth in certain parts o f the Empire, especially in the
Anatolian provinces. Government policy cannot, nevertheless, fully account for the
striking contrast between Selanik and the Empire at large, for the reform efforts
remained confined to a number of locations and probably contributed only marginally to
the overall development of Ottoman agriculture during the period under consideration.
Therefore, we should seek alternative factors that might account for the discrepancy in
question.
This brings me to the technical and methodological problems involved in the
estimation o f output levels, which could explain a good portion of the divergence
between agricultural performance in Selanik and the Ottoman economy at large. In my
opinion, Eldem almost certainly overestimates the performance of the agricultural
sector. Eldem bases his agricultural income estimates primarily on fiscal (tithe) data and
on the data published in the salnames and in the official agricultural statistics. However,
Eldem does not account for the distortion inherent in this fiscal data. He uses the tithe
data nominally to estimate trends in output performance and does not take into account
the general increase in agricultural prices. Besides, there is no evidence to suggest that
Eldem allows for the 20% rise in the tithe rate. Finally, Eldem does not appear to have
taken into account the government’s changing capacity to tax. Thus, it seems Eldem
almost certainly overestimates the performance of Ottoman agriculture during the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
The degree of overestimation inherent in Eldem’s data is difficult to ascertain.
However, if we were to account for the rise in the tithe rate alone, a rather conservative
20% margin of error would appear plausible. If we .were to account for all the
drawbacks, Eldem’s data would yield quite a different picture of Ottoman agriculture.
The overall trend would indeed be very close to that of Selanik, that is a steady
contraction at least until the turn o f the century, followed by a period of moderate
growth and partial recovery. This observation is also in accord with the broader
66


conjunctural trends prevailing throughout the eastern Mediterranean basin at the time. A
contraction in agricultural production during the crisis ridden 1880s and the 1890s
followed by sluggish recovery in the 1900s would be a more plausible thesis to put
forward, rather than arguing for steady and robust growth in agricultural production. At
any rate, the technical discussion that I have developed in the current chapter puts
considerable doubt on the accuracy of Eldem’s estimates, which have been widely used
by scholars since their publication in 1970.

CHAPTER II
DYNAMICS OF AGRARIAN TRANSFORMATION:
THE MARKET PROCESS
Introduction
In the previous chapter, I discussed the direction, magnitude and timing of the
shifts taking place in the agrarian economy of the Selanik region during the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. I argued that the overall agrarian economy
contracted notably from the mid-1880s onwards. I suggested, however, that this
contraction was not even within the sector. The performance o f certain sub-sectors was
quite impressive while others remained sluggish or even retarded. Thus, processes of
growth and retardation proceeded hand in hand in the agricultural sector, a situation
which marked the emergence of a dual agrarian structure in the region. It was precisely
this growing dualism that set the pattern o f overall structural transformation in Selanik’s
agrarian sector during the period under consideration.
In this chapter, I will consider the conjunctural and institutional dynamics of this
broad process of transformation. I will concentrate mainly on market forces that
underlined this complex process. First, I will consider demand side factors that pushed
and pulled various sub-sectors of the agrarian economy either into growth or
retardation. In this context, I develop a comprehensive approach that pays due attention
to the shifts taking place both in the domestic and overseas markets. Such an
‘integrated’ demand side approach contributes to and enhances our understanding of the
nineteenth century Ottoman economy and the processes underlining its transformation.
Ottoman economic historians, in general, and the proponents of the world system
analysis (WSA), in particular, have considered overseas demand as the primary
dynamic that conditioned the pattern and timing of the structural shifts taking place in
68


Ottoman agriculture.1 They ignored, however, the impact o f domestic demand on such
processes o f transformation and change.2 To a certain extent, this approach is justified,
for the shifts taking place in the international economy had a significant impact on
Ottoman agriculture during the nineteenth century. This impact was probably at its
strongest during the late nineteenth century, when the economic domination of
European capitalism largely went unchallanged on a global scale. However, it is not
possible to understand fully the economic dynamics underlining the transformation of
the agricultural sector without paying due attention to the shifts taking place in the
domestic, particularly in urban, markets. This is especially the case for such primary
crops as cereals, cotton, silk and tobacco that were traded and consumed in
considerable, if not massive, amounts in domestic markets. Accordingly the current
chapter develops a more balanced and comprehensive view of the shifts and changes
taking place in the agrarian economy and considers the impact of domestic as well as
overseas demand on the processes o f agricultural growth and retardation.
I will also take into account certain institutional processes that conditioned the
transformations taking place in the agrarian economy o f the Selanik region. In this
context, I borrow heavily from neo-institutionalist approaches and pay close attention to
the structural attributes of ftie legal and organisational frameworks that regulated the
exchange process at large.3 1 argue that the differences in the degree of effective market
regulation and the costs incurred from certain market transactions, inter alia, explain the
emergence of the dual agrarian structure outlined above. Besides, I consider the role
played by certain public and semi-public institutions in providing technical, logistic and
financial support to farming communities in. accord with their economic priorities and
interests. In this context, I discuss the role played by financial and commercial agents
and institutions that were firmly associated with European economic interests. The role

of the state will be considered only in passing, as this complex issue will be discussed in
Chapter 3 at length.
Finally, I make an effort to bring, as much as possible, the actors in this
transformation process into historical perspective. Whenever empirical sources allow
for such analysis, I will bring the perspective of petty merchants, landlords, farmers, as
well as the government officers, consuls and prominent members of influential
merchant families into the discussion and consider their dynamic participation as an
important factor that underlined the transformation of the agrarian economy.4 This effort
will introduce a perspective from below into our narrative, which allows us to better
understand the actual forces underlining transformations taking place in the agrarian
economy of the region.
Overall, I will pursue a comprehensive market-oriented analysis that considers
the economic conjuncture (i.e. demand side factors), institutional dynmics and human
agency in discussing processes of agrarian change. This approach diverges somewhat
from the standard WSA narratives that tend to overlook insitutional processes and put
greater emphasis on the transformative role played by economic forces. The current
approach also differs substantially from the standard modernist perspectives that
emphasise the importance o f institutional structures but inadequately discuss the
importance o f human agency in the processes of economic change.
The chapter is divided into three sections. In. the first section, I set the
conjunctural background and briefly discuss the broad trends in international markets
and in Ottoman agriculture during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In
the second section, I discuss the sub-sectors of the agrarian economy, which a) were not
favored by the conjuncture o f the international economy and b) suffered from certain

institutional deficiencies and market failures. These sub-sectors mainly include cereal
and cotton production. In the next section, I consider the sub-sectors, which, a) enjoyed
favourable demand side conditions and grew rapidly despite similar, if not as bitter,
institutional weaknesses, b) benefited from some institutional support and effective
market regulation and continued to grow despite unfavourable changes in economic
conjuncture, and c) enjoyed favourable market conditions, institutional support, and
effective market regulation. These sub-sectors include opium, silk and tobacco
production, respectively. The chapter ends with some concluding remarks on the
combined, overall impact o f these interlocking institutional and conjunctural processes
over agriculture in the Selanik region during the period under consideration.
1. The Conjunture and the Historical Context
The second half o f the Tong* nineteenth century witnessed the advent of an
unprecedented transport revolution on a global scale. The world wide construction of
railway networks and the appearance of steamships in international waters marked a
breakthrough in transport history signified by a drastic decline in costs of
transportation.5 The impact of the transport revolution was quite spectacular. The swift
reduction in the costs of transportation diminished the economic significance of
distances in world trade and enhanced integration in global commodity markets. This
transformation not only underlined the extraordinary expansion of world trade during
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,6 but it also gave way to the emergence
of new patterns of specialisation within and between the “central” and “peripheral”
regions o f the world economy.7 Certain regions became increasingly specialised in the
production of certain products, while others simply altered their economies and adjusted
to emergent market conditions. Roughly speaking, the “peripheral” regions of Asia,

Hugill, World Trade since 1431, Geography, Technology, and Capitalism, (Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1993). According to a recent estimate put forth by O’Rourke and Williamson, real freight rates in global trade fell massively, by as much as 1.5% per annum, between 1840 and 1910. J. G.

Latin America, Africa, and the Near East, and the areas of recent European settlements,
such as North-West America, Australia and New Zeland, became increasingly
specialised in the production of primary products.8 The first and second wave
industrialisers of Europe, the rapidly industrialising economy of North-East America,
and, albeit at a more modest rate and later in the century, Japan and Russia, emerged as
leading industrial powers in the world economy.9 Agriculture gradually lost its relative
significance in industrialising economies, although the sector still retained its political
weight, particularly in countries where agrarian traditionalism had long taken the centre
stage in power politics, such as in France, Germany, Russia and even in Japan.10
The impact of the transport revolution and the growing tide of globalization on
the Ottoman economy was quite mixed. Enhanced globalization created new
opportunities for Ottoman agriculture and increased overseas demand for certain
agricultural products. Cash crop production constituted the most dynamic segment of
Ottoman agriculture during this period. In particular, tobacco, silk, cotton, opium,
rasins, figs and sesame found regular purchasers in the overseas markets and the
production and exports of these important cash crops grew rapidly during the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.11

However, the tide of globalization also brought about certain problems for
Ottoman agriculture. First, increasing competition in overseas markets put Ottoman
farmers under economic strain and forced them to struggle with competitive prices
offered by the primary producers o f the Americas and Asia. Growing trade barriers
caused severe problems for Ottoman farmers and rendered their access to export
markets in Europe ever more difficult.12 Further, the producers of certain primary
products, such as madder root and yellow berries, lost ground in international markets
as artificial substitutes gradually took over world markets.13 Second, the local producers
were soon faced with intense competition in domestic markets, which struck a blow to
certain sub-sectors of Ottoman agriculture. The government could not provide the
Ottoman farmers with the degree o f protection that their counterparts enjoyed on the
continent, for it was obliged to accede to the terms of the liberal trade agreements
signed with European powers in the late 1830s and the 1840s.14 Under the
circumstances, the trade barriers remained extremely low at 8.0% and left domestic
producers highly exposed to overseas competition. For example, cereal and cotton
producers struggeled to compete with imported goods in domestic markets. At times
and in certain places, this competition yielded some success, but these sectors remained
largely defensive in general and seriously retarded in some instances.15 Thus, overall,

the transport revolution and the mounting tide of globalization in world commodity
markets led to the emergence o f a dual agrarian structure in Ottoman lands.
Another complex instiutional process underlied this dual structure. The Ottoman
farmers, it seems, were at a transction cost disadvanatage vis a vis their counterparts in
those parts of the world better integrated into the world capitalist markets. Despite the
construction of some railways, transportation costs remained quite high during the late
nineteenth century.16 This situation proved particularly detrimental for certain
agricultural sectors. Above all, high railway tariffs and other costs of overland
transportation affected adversely cereal production. This transportation cost problem
was particularly distressing for cereal producers and was responsible for the relatively
poor export and output performance of the sector.17 Furthermore, the ineffectiveness of
certain regulations, meant to supervise transactions and secure fair trading, competitive
pricing and prime quality in marketed produce led to market failures that caused
insurmountable difficulties for Ottoman agriculturalists.18 In short, the ‘transaction cost*
constraint underlined the retardation o f certain compartments o f Ottoman agriculture,
most notably in cereal production.
The consolidation o f European commercial and financial interests in the
Ottoman empire underscored the emergence of a dual agrarian structure during the same
period. On the one hand, the commercial houses and railway companies actively
supported farmers and encouraged them to take up the production o f commercial crops.
They offered remunerative prices to encourage the production o f these products and
provided the Ottoman farmers with the financial means as well as logistic support that
were necessary to take such action. 19 The commercial companies and agents thus

contributed to the commercialisation o f the agrarain economy at large and to the growth
of certain sub-sectors that were favoured by the economic conjuncture in certain parts of
the empire, especially in Western and Central Anatolian provinces.
On the other hand, European financial interests played an important role in the
emergence o f a dual agrarian structure. From the mid-1850s onwards, the Ottoman state
borrowed heavily in the international money markets to finance its administrative and
military modernisation programs. The terms of foreign borrowing were often
unfavourable and obliged the Ottoman government to declare a moratorium on all its
outstanding foreign debt in 1876. Following a five-year period of uncertainty and
prolonged negotiations, the Ottoman government agreed to the establishment of the
Ottoman Public Debt Administration (PDA) in a decree that it issued on December 20,
1881. The PDA was mainly a consortium of French, British, German and Ottoman
representatives responsible for the reorganisation and repayment of the outstanding
Ottoman debt. The Imperial Decree also granted the PDA the rights to administer,
collect and to hold in deposit revenues accruing from salt and tobacco monopolies, silk
tithes, and charges on spirits and fisheries. The PDA also held the rights to retain the
Bulgarian tribute and the surplus of Cyprus revenues for the service of the outstanding
foreign bonds.20 Until the last days of the Empire, the PDA retained its status and
remained in charge o f a substantial portion of government revenues, while at the same
time managing the foreign debt service. It also assumed an important role in raising new
loans in the European money markets and played an active part in financing of railway
construction in the Ottoman Empire.21
In a broad macroeconomic sense, the PDA had retarding effects on the Ottoman
economy. The PDA not only seriously circumscribed the fiscal powers of the Ottoman
state and curtailed its capacity to institute wide ranging reforms, but it also undermined
the accumulation o f capital within the empire through massive capital transfers abroad.

Thus it helped prepare the macroeconomic grounds for underinvestment in the Ottoman
economy.22
However, the PDA contributed in important ways to the development and
growth of sericulture and tobacco production throughout the empire. The PDA and its
administrative offshoots provided technical, logistic and financial support to farmers
who were engaged in the production of these crops. The PDA also provided a legal and
administrative framework that closely regulated the production and marketing of these
products, especially of tobacco. Although some of the measures had a retarding effect
on agricultural production in the short-run, they set the specific terms and conditions of
marketing and thus defined the rules of the game in due exchange processes.23 More
importantly, the PDA managed to enforce these regulations quite effectively and thus
minimised, or rather moderated, certain market failures that had claimed much from the
robustness o f such unregulated sub-sectors of the agrarian economy as cereal and cotton
production. In this respect, the regulatory framework set by the PDA and its
enforcement powers seem to have contributed to the growth of sericulture and tobacco
production. In what follows, we will concentrate on the dynamics of agrarian
transformation in Selanik against the backdrop of the economic conjuncture and the
structural processes outlined above.
2. Agricultural Production in an Unregulated Context
2.1. Cereal Production
The impact o f the transport revolution was felt particularly strongly in world
cereal markets. The costs o f conveying bulky cereals declined by 50.0% to 70.0%
during the last quarter o f the nineteenth century. This brought the cereal producers of
North America, the Black Sea basin and the Indian subcontinent within easy reach of
the expanding European consumer markets. In response, world cereal production and
exports grew rapidly during the same period. Between c.1875 and c.1910, wheat
production in the Black Sea region rose by 170.0% between c.1875 and c.1910. North

76


American wheat production grew by 85.0% while that o f India increased 65.0%.24
Wheat exports from Russia and the Danubian provinces rose more than threefold.
Wheat exports from North' America almost doubled and Indian exports increased by
more than seven times during the same period.25 Thus, the Black Sea basin, the frontier
settlements in mid and North Western America and India, and other important primary
producers such as Argentina and Australia emerged as the granaries of the world
economy, providing cheap foodstuffs for the rapidly growing urban population of the
industrial economies of Europe and north America.26
This expansionary process in world cereal trade was marked by an
unprecedented price depression in European cereal markets. The cheap grains of
“peripheral” areas soon glutted the markets, leading to a swift diminution in prices from
the early 1870s onwards. Wheat prices in the United Kingdom decreased by about 50%
between the early 1870s and the mid-late 1890s. Even throughout the reflationary
period o f 1896-1914, prices could make only a partial recovery in international markets.
Wheat prices in the UK increased only about 17.0% during the period and still stood
well below their early 1870 level on the eve of the Great War.27 The same deflationary
trends were parallelled in the continent as well. This situation put European cereal
producers under strong competitive pressure even in the domestic urban consumer
markets.28
The continental economies responded swiftly to the ‘peripheral’ challenge.
Modernisation o f agriculture and effective protectionism constituted the primary axis of
continental response to the intensifying overseas competition.29 Behind trade barriers,
continental cereal production grew considerably. French wheat production increased by
56.0%, German by 43.0%, Italian by 28.0% and Austria-Hungarian by 130.0% during
the period under consideration.30

These developments disadvantaged greatly the cereal producing farmers of
Selanik. Before the Hamidian period, Selanik had already become an important supplier
of cereals for overseas markets. Cereal trade grew rapidly during the eighteenth century.
According to Svoronos, cereal exports from Salonica increased almost tenfold from
1,270 tons in 1763 to 11,290 tons in 1798.31 Local grains found regular purchasers in
the leading port-towns o f the Mediterranean basin, such as Trieste, Venice, Genoa,
Marseilles, Istanbul and Alexandria.32
Regional cereal trade further extended its reach to the relatively distant northern
European markets of Liverpool, Hamburg and Antwerp during the first half of the
nineteenth century. In the meantime, regular overseas trade with the Mediterranean
markets continued to expand considerably.33 According to one contemporary estimate,
cereal exports from Salonica stood around 28,000 tons in 1809.34 By the late 1860s, this
figure had gone up to 40,000 tons.35
Despite the expansion in overseas trade, the region was not in a position to
capture a commanding position in overseas markets. The cereals coming from the Black
Sea basin literally out-competed the Macedonian produce in the Mediterranean and
northern European markets. Local produce could be traded in large amounts only in
times o f great scarcity generated by unusual crop failures, wars and other exogenous
factors that seriously disturbed the regular flow of supplies from the Black Sea basin.
Otherwise, foreign merchants normally preferred the cheap and good quality Black Sea

grains to the local produce and purchased Selanik produce mainly for regular market
clearance.36
The advent of American and Indian competition in international markets,
growing protectionism in the continent, and the ensuing price depression in international
cereal markets in the aftermath o f the transport revolution simply intensified
competition and put local cereal producers under immense pressure. They now faced a
multitude of challenges. They had to cope with the swift depression in cereal prices,
compete with good quality cereal varieties in overseas markets, get around the problem
o f transportation costs, and jump over the hurdle of prohibitive tariff walls sheltering
continental agriculture from foreign competition. Besides, they had to compete with
imported cereals in the largely underprotected domestic markets. As we shall see, little
could be done to overcome any o f these problems and the region failed to make a
breakthrough in overseas cereal trade.
2.1.1. Price Depression and the Stalemate in Overseas Trade
The worldwide depression in cereal prices did not hit Selanik markets until the
early-1880s. The inflationary moment of the Russo-Turkish War o f 1876-1877 and the
disastrous crop failure of 1879 helped maintain local cereal prices for a while.37 From
the early 1880s onwards, however, cereal prices started to decline rapidly in Salonica.
The price depression was quite swift with prices descending by over 42.5% between the
early 1870s and 1895 (See Table 2.1). The only exception to this secular downward
trend was the speculative leap o f 1891-1892, which' was caused mainly by the
withdrawal of Russian cereals from the world markets due to the severe famine of
1891.38 The ensuing vacuum in overseas markets increased the demand for local
produce and fuelled cereal prices in Salonica almost up to the pre-depression levels.
Once the Russians stepped back into the international markets, local prices went under

The post-1895 price recovery was both slow and limited. Not even strong
exogenous shocks could initiate a lasting recovery. For instance, 1896 was a bad year
for cereal producers throughout the world. Crops had failed in India, Russia and in
Western Europe.39 This situation increased the demand for Selanik grains and created
many opportunities for local merchants to market their produce overseas at favourable
prices. Not surprisingly, speculative trading in local markets quickly drew prices up to
new heights. Prices started rising in Salonica from mid-April 1996 onwards and
increased about 40% in just a fortnight.40 As the surplus of the hinterland rapidly glutted
the Salonica market, however, local prices again went under. That year, cereal prices
increased by a modest 5.0% on average, adding only marginally to the long-term
recovery trend. Yet, local speculators, especially the leading cereal merchants of the
region such as the Modiyano and the Alatini families, earned handsome profits from
speculative trading and retained their undisputed control over the cereal market of
Salonica.41

Another exogenous price shock was generated by the combined effect of the
Greco-Turkish War of 1897 and the Spanish American War of 1898. To start with, the
American harvest of 1897 was relatively poor and the possibility of war with Spain
heightened speculative concerns in European cereal markets. Apprehensive of the price
controls superimposed by a syndicate formed by leading American cereal merchants
and trading houses, European merchants turned increasingly towards the alternative
grain markets of the Mediterranean basin.42 From April onwards, the grain merchants of
Salonica started to receive orders from their agents in Mersailles, Trieste, Genova, and
Liverpool43
Simultaneously, the mounting tensions between the Ottoman and Greek
governments over the diplomatic status o f Crete erupted into armed conflict on April 10.
The orders o f the Ottoman army fighting in Northern Greece and Western Macedonia
further increased the demand for cereals, fanning the inflationary moment in the local
cereal markets. The region had entered 1897 with minimal grain stocks, which had been
largely consumed largely during the previous year.44 Moreover, the harvest of 1897 was
likely to be a poor one and was expected to stand below its normal level by as much as
50.0%.45 In fact, the situation was serious enough to draw the attention of local
authorities. The local government briefly considered the possibility of imposing an
export ban and set up a special committee to monitor regional grain reserves. The
committee eventually maintained that the local reserves were sufficient to provide
supplies for both the local civilian population and the army and concluded that the
region could release an extra 7,500 tons for export until the end o f the year. The export
ban was not imposed, but it became quite apparent that the existing stocks could not be
sufficient to meet the incoming orders from the overseas markets.46 The situation gave
way to a quasi-Kindlebergerian mania in Salonica. Prices rose by an unprecedented
70.0% over just a fortnight between April 20 and May 9.47 However, soon it became

European markets with sufficient supplies. Besides, the war with Greece lasted only a
month.48 Under the circumstances, the speculative bubble burst in Salonica and the bull
market in cereals could not realistically be maintained for long. Next year, stagnation hit
the Salonica markets again, and the prices reverted to the mediocre levels of the long
term recovery trend.49

After 1905, a combination of domestic and international events drove cereal
prices up rapidly. The first destabilising shock came with the demand boom generated
by the Russo-Japanese War and the Russian revolution of 1905. War and revolution in
Russia largely disturbed the Black Sea grain trade and almost instantly increased the
European demand for local cereals. The situation fanned speculation in Salonica and
cereal prices went up by about 15.0% on average in 1905.50 The 1905 stocks largely
were exhausted by October, and the region entered 1906 with minimal reserves. A

severe local crop failure that year further depressed output levels, a situation that
aggravated inflation in domestic markets.51 This time, however, the crop failures proved
more persistent than usual, and a streak o f successive harvest failures between 1907 and
1910 seriously undermined the productive capacity of the region. Consequently, cereal
prices in Salonica increased by 40% between 1904 and 1910. Only the above average
harvests of 1911 and 1912 could reverse this inflationary trend.52 On the eve of the
Balkan Wars, cereal prices were more or less restored to their pre-1875 levels.
However, the export markets were a lost cause now as adverse economic conditions
prevented local producers from competing in international markets.
Export performance of the sector remained unmistakably sluggish during the
period under consideration. Cereal exports from Salonica lingered around an average of
70,000 tons, with only brief instances of rapid expansion and growth (See Chart 2.2).
Even the construction of three important railway lines, which linked Salonica to the
Macedonian hinterland, could not initiate a breakthrough in overseas trade. The opening
o f the Uskiip, Manastir and Istanbul railway lines in 1872, 1892 and 1894, respectively,
could not jump-start overseas trade. Only two exogenous shocks, that is the Russo
Ottoman War of 1876 and the Russian famine o f 1891, triggered a short-lived expansion
in overseas trade. Following the restoration of balances in international cereal markets,
however, regional exports settled back to the mediocre 70,000-ton benchmark and
remained at that level until 1905. After this date, exports from the region declined
swiftly. The above mentioned streak o f harvest failures were responsible largely for the
unusually poor export performance o f the region. The gradual recovery materialised
only with the reversal of harvest trends in the following years. Still, exports from
Salonica amounted only to 44,770 tons in 1912.
A number of factors seem to have underlined the sluggish export performance of
the region and its persistent failure to respond to emergent competition in the overseas
markets. Serious supply side factors withheld the realisation of the export potential of
the region. These supply side problems will be discussed in detail in the following
chapter. It suffices to say for now that the failure to modernise agriculture, intense
scarcity o f labour, and the political instability that affected the Macedonian countryside

largely undermined the region’s capacity to respond to the challenge of the overseas
markets. However, equally serious problems affected the actual process of marketing
and withheld the local cereal producers from making headway in the overseas markets.
In what follows, I will concentrate on these market constraints in detail.
The Transaction Cost Constraint: The Railway Tariffs
High costs of overland transport had for long been a persistent and indeed
prohibitive problem for local cereal producers. The main river systems of the region
were too shallow and unpredictable, thus rendering the cheapest option for the
transportation o f bulky goods infeasible. The local merchants had to transport cereals
overland from the interior to the port o f Salonica for export. At that time, the roads were
in poor condition and did not allow for easy cart transportation. Therefore, the caravans
had to rely on more expensive animal transportation, which naturally increased the costs
of overland transportation.53
This situation put the local farmers at a disadvantage, especially against their
counterparts in the Black Sea region, who could transport their produce with relative
ease, safety, and at a considerably lower cost along the extensive waterways provided
by the Rivers Danube, Dniester, Dnieper and Don to the main Black Sea ports.54
Similarly, the North American cereal producers could transport their produce on
railways, lakes, canals and river systems with ease, safety, and at a relatively low cost.
In this respect, the local producers were already at a ‘transaction cost’ disadvantage
before the appearance o f railways in the region. For instance, all transaction costs,
including the insurance and octroi charges involved in transporting wheat from Chicago
to Liverpool totalled to 50 cents per bushel, or covered only a third of Liverpool wheat
price c.1870.55 In contrast, the local transport costs in Selanik could constitute as much
as 50.0% o f the f.o.b price o f wheat in Salonica, and could amount to 50 cents per
bushel in the mid-1860s.56 In other words, carrying grains all the way from Chicago to
Liverpool could cost as much as transporting cereals over to the port of Salonica from
its hinterland.

The construction of railways undoubtedly cut the cost of transportation and
increased the speed and security of conveyance. In this respect, the positive impact of
railways on regional cereal production cannot be denied.57 However, the railways did
not come problem-free, and they did not solve all the problems associated with the
transportation of bulky cereals everywhere in the region. First, the subsidiary roads
linking the interior grain fields to the rail lines and to the major urban centres of the
region remained in quite poor condition throughout the region. Under the
circumstances, intermediary merchants were compelled to convey the cereal produce on
animals to railway stations. Reliance on this rudimentary method o f carriage increased
the costs of transportation.58 Secondly, the tariffs on these railway lines were set at
exorbitantly high rates, due to the high kilometric guarantees given by the Ottoman
government to the railway companies.59 For instance, the railway tariffs on cereals
could constitute as much as a third of the wheat prices and a half o f the prices of oat,
rye, barley or maize in Salonica in the 1880s.60
This situation disadvantaged local cereal producers and merchants alike. The
mercantile community of Salonica in specific felt the pressure of the railway tariffs and
put incessant pressure on the railway companies to reduce the tariffs.61 In 1888, Messrs.
Alatini Brothers, the leading grain merchants of Salonica, voiced the concerns of the
mercantile community in a report submitted to the British consulate:
Unfortunately, the ever-increasing competition of America and India, whose products find thenway to centres o f production in Europe, and the low prices which are the natural result, have deprived the export trade o f Salonica o f all the development... In fact, the landed proprietors have found it impossible .to realise their harvests by sending them abroad owing on the one hand, to the low prices of the markets, and, on the other hand, to the tariffs of the Salonica Railway, which are still enormously high ...62

In the same year, the Alatini report also appeared in the semi-official journal of
the Istanbul Chamber o f Commerce. The report pointed to the prohibitive nature of
railway tariffs and subtly drew the Porte’s attention to the urgency of the matter.63 The
voice o f the Alatini report could not have gone unnoticed in Istanbul. The Alatinis were
extremely powerful in Salonica. They controlled the bulk of the export/import trade,
served as the primary grain suppliers for the provincial military garrisons, assumed a
strong presence in local credit markets, had firm interests in urban construction industry
and real estate market, and owned almost all industrial establishments in the city of
Salonica.64 Together with other influential Jewish families of the town, the Alatinis
owned or controlled all major business concerns in Salonica.65 The family maintained
contacts in consular offices and government bureaus at the highest level. Such leading
figures o f the family as Alfred Alatini had established firm relations with local notables,
government officials and European consuls residing in Salonica. Through these,
connections they could, and seemingly did, put considerable political and diplomatic
pressure on the Oriental Railway Company.
In the months following the publication of the Alatini Report, the concerns of
the mercantile community led by the Alatini family took a more structured and official
tone. The Salonica Chamber of Commerce and the provincial government assumed
active initiative in the resolution o f the matter and put incessant pressure on the
representatives o f the Oriental Railway Company. These efforts were backed strongly
by the British consul, Mr. Blunt, who had been petitioning the embassy, complaining
about the adverse effect o f the railway tariffs on British trade with Serbia via the port of
Salonica for almost a decade.66 The ensuing political and diplomatic pressures
eventually bore fruit and forced the Oriental Railway Company to reduce the tariffs
over the Salonica-Uskiip line.67
Reductions had an immediate positive impact on overseas trade. The hinterland

1889 were transported over to Salonica, glutting the market and causing a considerable
reduction in cereal prices in 1889.68
However, world cereal prices declined even further during the 1890s and soon
railway tariffs once again became a notorious problem for local merchants and
producers. A glance at the contemporary newspapers and petitions reveal the intensity
of the complaints o f Salonica’s merchants and landlord’s about the exorbitance o f the
railway tariffs. For instance, a group of merchants from Salonica argued that the tariffs
were preventing quite literally the traders from sending the produce of its hinterland to
Salonica, even in times of buoyant demand and rising prices.69 Similarly, a group of
landlords from the neighbouring province of Manastir complained about the “absurdity”
of the high railway tariffs and pointed to the fact that trains arriving with goods at
Manastir were returning to Salonica almost completely empty. This, they argued, was
causing implicit revenue losses for the Ottoman government, whilst putting the local
cereal producers at a serious disadvantage.70 Another anonymous merchant from the
district of Selanik reprimanded the tariff policy of the Oriental Railway Company and
suggested that a reduction in railway tariffs would actually increase the revenue of the
company. He also argued that a reduction in tariffs would decrease the kilometric
guarantee burden o f the Ottoman government. A reasonable reduction would help
generate a substantial recovery in grain trade and encourage cereal cultivation in the
region. Thus, he held, the' company, the government, cereal producers and merchants
would all benefit from potential tariff reductions.71
The political pressure exerted by local notables, prominent merchants and
European consuls again bore fruit, and forced the railway companies to agree to further
reductions on the Manastir line in 1894 and on the Uskup line in 1897.72 These final
reductions could have a positive impact on local cereal trade, but they came too late to
make a lasting impact on overseas trade. The damage had already been done over the
previous two decades. Pressed hard under adverse conjuncture o f the international
economy and prohibitive transportation costs, many long-time cereal producers in the
region had already switched to the production of more profitable and less bulky cash

crops, such as opium, tobacco, sesame, cotton, and silk cocoons.73 Besides, the crop
failures of the 1897-1905 period undermined largely the export potential of the region.
Under the circumstances, tariff reductions simply fell short o f bringing about the desired
effect.
The Marketing Process and Lack o f Regulatory Bodies:
Another serious problem that undermined the export potential o f the region was
the poor marketing quality o f local grains. The cereal produce sent from the interior
often arrived at Salonica in a heavily debased condition.74 Above all, wheat contained
broken seeds mixed with rye, barley and oats, as well as with hay and sand. At times,
the debris could weigh as much as 40.0% o f the produce.75
Debasement hurt overseas trade in a number of important ways. First, the
intermediary merchants had to pay for the transportation o f mere debris over the roads
and railways. Thus, debasement inflated the costs of transportation, which, as we have
seen, were already prohibitively high. Second, the poor quality of the marketed produce
undermined the commercial reputation of local cereals and seriously curtailed the
competitiveness of the sector in overseas markets. European merchants, quite
justifiably, favoured the better sieved Russian and American grains and showed interest
in cereals from Salonica only under extraordinary conditions.76
There were a few reasons for the poor marketing quality o f the local produce. To
start with, the use o f mechanised sieves was not widespread in the region. Thus, it was
difficult to separate weak and broken seeds or sand and hay from the marketed
produce.77 The lack o f an institutional framework that would encourage the introduction
and diffusion of this complex and expensive technology was largely responsible for the
persistence o f the problem throughout the region.78
73 D.T.O.G., 16.R.1313 (5.10.1895), N. 562: 472; F.O.A.S., 1896, N. 1663: 7. 1AAsir, 20.Za.1318 (11.3.1901), N. 566: 2. 75 Asir, 28.§.1319 (10.12.1901), N. 640: 2-3.

7^ See Chapter 3 for the difficulties encountered in the introduction, diffusion and maintenance o f modem agricultural technology into the region.
88


In addition, there were serious problems in the marketing process itself that
allowed for, and indeed quite openly encouraged, debasement. At the time, most of the
surplus grain ended up in the hands of estate owners, intermediary merchants and tax
farmers.79 These agents either marketed the produce in nearby urban markets or sold it
to local representatives o f the large trading houses of Salonica. The representatives, in
turn, forwarded the produce to Salonica and took a handsome commission in return for
their services. No public authority or semi-autonomous body regulated or oversaw the
marketing of cereals. The administrative councils and local municipalities could oversee
marketing within urban centres they governed, but lacked simply the political and
administrative capacity to regulate the marketing o f cereals in the countryside and along
the railway lines.80 Under the circumstances, the actual process of marketing went
largely unchecked leaving much room for deceptive practices.
Debasement was the typical manifestation, or rather the outcome, of this
unregulated market framework. It seems the producers probably sold the mixed, broken
and sandy grains to the local merchants, arguing that they did not have mechanised
sieves at their disposal. The local merchants and the tax-farmers further debased the
produce before selling it to the intermediary merchants and the agents, probably
claiming that the phoney farmers and landlords were responsible for the poor quality of
the produce. The intermediaries acting on behalf of the trading houses and working on
commission probably mixed the grains with more debris along the railway line and sent
it to Salonica in quite poor condition.81
The exporters in Salonica faced a crucial decision. They could either fully cover
the additional costs of exporting the produce in prime condition, or ship the debased
produce as it was, accepting lower prices and further penalties for debasement in the
well monitored English and French markets. Neither option was desirable for the
trading houses. Sieving tons of debased produce would simply increase operational
costs and lead to considerable loss of revenue. However, sending the debased produce
abroad would both lead to lower prices and undermine the commercial reputation of
local cereals in European markets.
79 See Chapter 4 for taxation practices and systems o f land-tenure in Selanik. For the organisation of local marketing networks see Chapter-5. 81 Asir, 2.Za.l319 (10.2.1902), N. 657: 1.
89


The leading cereal traders of Salonica chose to sieve grains, especially primary
cereals such as wheat and maize, in their warehouses and flour factories and incurred
the ensuing operational costs.82 Disturbed by this situation the leading trading houses of
Salonica took certain precautions that would help resolve the problem.83 They formed a
cartel and imposed a surcharge o f five paras for every kiyye of grain sold in the town,
regardless of the quality or the condition of the grain produce. The surcharge was to be
paid by the merchants and intermediary agents, who were largely responsible for
debasement. In principle, the money accruing from the surcharge was to be collected
under a special fund and used to sieve the debased grain in Salonica.84
The members o f the cartel misused this fund. They happily shared the returns
accruing from the surcharge and continued to sieve some of the produce in their private
warehouses and flourmills. The produce marketed by smaller merchants, who did not
have sieving facilities at their disposal, was not sieved at all and was shipped overseas
in quite poor condition, much to the annoyance of the importers in Europe and other
Mediterranean ports.85 At any rate, the actual producers, who already suffered from
declining prices and high costs of transportation, ultimately paid the surcharge. The
agents and intermediary merchants claimed the surcharge from the farmers, either
directly by transmitting the surcharge or indirectly by offering lower prices.86
A decade later, members of the cartel voiced their concerns over debasement in
a rhetorical fashion and asked for new legislation that would enable the municipal
authorities to penalise deceitful merchants and intermediary agents. Thus, they argued,
they could abolish the surcharge and ship the produce in prime condition to overseas
markets.87
At the time, such regulatory legislation was not entirely unforseen in Ottoman
lands. For instance, certain trade regulations had been instituted to secure the quality of
82 Asir, 2.Za.l319 (10.2.1902), N. 657: 1.

grains in the neighbouring town of Dedeaga?. There, the exporters were obliged to buy
the produce that contained a maximum of 2.0% debris. Anything above the 2.0%
margin had to be cleaned by the intermediary merchants and delivered to the exporter in
good condition. Naturally, all the associated costs of sieving were to be incurred by the
intermediaries.88 Even in Salonica, the local officials and the municipal government
closely monitored the marketing of red hot chilli peppers and successfully prevented the
debasement o f the produce.89
However, the situation was somewhat more complex for wheat trade. It was not
easy to institute such regulatory measures in the heavily structured cereal market of
Salonica. Neither the local municipality nor the local chambers of agriculture and
commerce had the administrative muscle and the political capacity to monitor and
regulate the overseas cereal trade, which was firmly controlled by the influential
families of the town. Besides, the sheer size and scope o f cereal trade rendered effective
regulation even more difficult.90 Nevertheless, in 1907, local officials considered the
establishment o f a wheat exchange in Salonica, which would impose quality controls
and ensure fair and competitive trading in the city markets.91 The large trading houses
opposed the idea of a boursier, which potentially could jeopardise their hitherto
unchallenged grip over Salonica market.92 Repeatedly, they argued against the
establishment o f the wheat exchange and put considerable pressure on the local
authorities in order to prevent it. They claimed that the Salonica cereal market was not,
after all, that important to necessitate a boursier.93
Their argument was somewhat justified. Cereal trade in Salonica had shrunk
over the last few years and the city could actually do without a boursier, as it had done
for decades. However, the line of defence put forth by the trading houses was also
rhetorical. First, there were quite a few wheat exchanges operating successfully in such

governing the establishment and operation of cereal exchanges in the empire clearly
stipulated that any town endowed with a chamber of commerce and agriculture was, in
principle, entitled to a cereal exchange. Salonica was certainly fit for one.95
The Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, Mahmud Kapanci Efendi, was not
entirely convinced by the cartel members’ line of reasoning and demanded the
establishment o f a wheat exchange in Salonica. He presented his official application to
the Sublime Porte on September 3, 1907. The Porte was quick to respond to the
application, and the Ministry o f Commerce and Public Works issued the necessary
permit on October 30, 1907.96 The legal ground was ready for the establishment of a
regulated ‘wheat-market’ in Salonica. However, the evidence at hand indicates that the
plan did not materialise in practice because of the opposition of the trading houses.
There is no sign that either the planned wheat exchange or the large trading houses did
much to improve the quality o f the produce marketed in Salonica. Debasement
remained a problem.
2.1.2. Transformation of the Domestic Market: Between New Horizons and Old Problems:
The overseas cereal trade constituted an indispensable component o f the regional
economy earlier in the nineteenth century. As we have seen, cereals had been one of the
leading, if not the primary, export items of the region. Export trade provided local
farmers with an important source o f livelihood and prosperity. It also brought riches to
prominent landlords, local merchants, commercial intermediaries, and the leading
‘bourgeois’ families o f Salonica, and thus contributed to the overall process of capital
accumulation. In this respect, the economic importance of the overseas cereal trade
cannot be denied.
In fact, cereal trade was much more diffuse and extensive than the Salonica
oriented export trade would suggest. Cereals constituted the main food staple of the

local population.97 In urban areas, people mainly consumed standard white bread, which
was made primarily of good quality wheat. The diet of the rural populace was somewhat
more modest; peasant farmers normally consumed a peculiar type of bread baked from a
blend of wheat and lesser grain varieties, such as, rye, barley, maize and oats.98 This
special place of cereals as the basic food staple of the region presumably assured their
vibrant and regular trading in local markets. Providing wheat supplies to urban centres
constituted the primary axis of the regional cereal trade. According to the estimates
presented in Table 2.1, the. consumption of wheat in urban areas accounted for about 65
70.0% of the total wheat consumption in the region. This should not come as a surprise,
for the rural population relied mainly on their own produce for basic staples and
remained outside the extended circuit of commodity exchange. In certain districts where
cash crop production was particularly predominant, such as Drama, Kavala, San-§aban
and Provide, the dependence of the rural population on markets for basic staples was
more prevalent. The consumption of wheat in these locations probably accounted for the
region’s remaining commercial wheat consumption. In general, however, the provision
of wheat for the urban population appears to have accounted for the bulk of the regional
trade in cereals. In what follows, I will concentrate on this urban dimension of the cereal
trade.

The local trade in wheat provisions seems to have grown steadily during the
period under consideration. According to the estimates presented in Table 2.1, urban
wheat consumption more than doubled between 1876 and 1911 and reached an all time
high of 85,804 tons on the eve of the Balkan Wars. In due course, exports diminished
from over 50,000 tons to virtually naught in 1911. Thus, the urban domestic market
became predominant in regional wheat trade by the eve of the Balkan Wars.
The growth o f urban demand for local cereals created many opportunities for
cereal producers and allowed them to resist the tide of depression, particularly through
the crisis ridden 1880s and 1890s. Indeed, local farmers increasingly turned towards the
immediate domestic urban markets and specialised in provisioning the region’s growing
urban population. Wheat and flour were imported in significant amounts only in times
of severe crop failures. Otherwise, the domestic markets remained the exclusive source
of local cereal consumption.
This is a telling observation. As I have noted, the Ottoman trade regime was
quite liberal and the domestic markets were on the whole unprotected from the winds of
foreign competition. Under the circumstances, we would normally expect the cheap
American, Russian and Indian cereals and flour to capture a commanding position in the
domestic urban markets. Therefore, we must seek alternative factors that can help
explain the predominance of local produce in regional markets. Two preventive factors
appear particularly important in this respect. The first is high harbour dues and charges
prevailing in the port o f Salonica. The second is, again, the prohibitive costs of overland
transportation in the region.
Excessive harbour dues and charges, customs tariffs and various labour services
charged at the port of Salonica had been a matter of complaint amongst the merchants
involved in overseas trade." To start with, the ships calling at Salonica had to pay quite
substantial anchorage dues that could vary between 10 and 30 kuru§QS, according to the
tonnage o f the ship and the duration of its stay in the port. In addition, merchants
discharging and loading cargoes alongside the quay were obliged to pay an extra
harbour due to the appointed quay commissioners. The normal rate was 20 paras per
ton o f cargo handled at the quay. However, the surcharge over cereals was subject to a
94


different scale. The merchants had to pay one para per kile of wheat, maize, rye and
sesame and three paras per kile o f barley and oats discharged along the quay line.100 It
is not easy to determine the rate o f effective protection provided by these charges and
dues. However, altogether they could amount to about 2.0% o f the current wheat price
prevailing in Salonica, adding only marginally to the protection provided by the 8.0%
ad valorem import tariff.101
The porters o f Salonica, however, imposed a more substantial trade barrier. The
porters constituted one o f the most powerful segments of the town’s working classes.
They were organised under a powerful guild that regulated all matters pertaining to
portage in the port. The guild set the charges of portage at considerably high rates and,
through passive resistance and tough bargaining managed to dictate its terms to
merchants and intermediary agents trading in Salonica.102 There is no evidence at hand
that gives detailed information on the charges claimed by the guild. Therefore, it is not
easy to determine the rate of protection provided by the extra costs of portage. However,
considering the persistent protests o f the local and foreign merchants and the incessant
diplomatic pressure exerted by European consuls, we can reasonably suggest that the
charges imposed by the guild of porters increased the tariff barriers quite
substantially.103 These charges must have helped increase the effective rate of protection
by an indeterminate but evidently significant margin.

101 Consider the following hypotethical case: Let us assume that a 25 ton ship loaded fully with a wheat cargo anchored at Salonica in 1890. The ship would pay at least 10 kuru§ in total, or 40 paras per ton, for anchorage. In addition, the merchant would pay 38 paras per ton o f wheat discharged at the quay, which adds up to about 80 paras in all. In 1890, the fob price o f a ton o f wheat in Salonica was about 37 kuru$. Therefore, 80 para surcharge would correspond to 2.2% o f the local price o f wheat in Salonica.

The construction o f a commercial harbour in Salonica and of a short railway line
that linked the new harbour to the Salonica railway station in the early 1900s, reduced
the rate o f effective protection provided by the above discussed dues, charges and
tariffs.104 The new harbour that allowed for direct anchorage and reduced harbour dues
and other charges associated with moorage. The short railway line allowed trains direct
access to the port, and curbed the monopolistic powers o f the guild, which brought
about a notable reduction in the associated costs of portage. Indeed, the construction of
the rail line between the harbour and the railway station, seem to have somewhat
constrained the powers of the guild. Many porters formerly employed between the
quays and the railway station lost their jobs and became mere carriers wondering the
streets o f Salonica.105 Despite the blow, however, the guild did not entirely lose its
influence in the town and continued to claim charges from traders in the port until the
end o f the period. The organisational power o f the guild and its influence manifested in
boycotts of Austrian and Greek goods in 1908-1910. The guild o f porters and the
boatmen of Salonica assumed active initiative in the organisation and execution of these
successful boycotts and refused to handle Austrian and Greek cargoes, causing much
distress among traders while earning the admiration o f the local representatives of the
Committee o f Union and Progress.106
In addition, the construction of the new harbour did not lead to a reduction in
harbour dues and charges as might be expected. Quite to the contrary, the French
Harbour Company set the dues at exorbitantly high rates.107 For instance, the harbour
due for wheat was set at 15 paras per 100 kg, or at 1.5 kuru§Qs per ton. The local price

of wheat was about 32 kuru§ per ton at the time, that is c. 1900.108 Thus, the dues
charged by the Harbour Company accounted for 4.7% of the local wheat price. These
dues were clearly higher than those prevailing at any other Ottoman port in the
Mediterranean.109 When combined with the surcharge claimed by the porters and the
8.0% tariff, the harbour dues could provide some degree of protection for the regional
cereal markets.
However, it seems the degree o f protection provided by the tariffs, charges and
other dues claimed at the port and the customs were not entirely sufficient to prevent
imported cereals and flour from making headway in the internal domestic markets at the
expense of the local produce. By the mid-1900s, the region had already become a
regular importer of cereals and flour coming mainly from the Black Sea region. In 1911,
imports accounted for about 40.0% o f total urban wheat consumption in Selanik (see
Table 2.1). In order to understand the underlining reasons for growing import
dependency we must also consider the changes in the overall costs of transportation,
particularly from Salonica towards the hinterland.
The exorbitant costs o f transportation seem to have provided the sector with
some degree o f de facto protection until the early and mid-1890s. Surely, the high costs
of transportation were far from being a blessing for local merchants and farmers, for
these costs prevented them from reaping fully the benefits of the growing home demand
for cereals. For instance, as late as 1896, the railway tariffs, despite previous reductions,
prevented the cereal producers o f Avrethisan from sending their produce to the
neighbouring town of Siroz, which was only a few railway stops away. Consequently,
grain stocks piled up in the warehouses, waiting for a substantial recovery in prices that
would allow for profitable trading within the region.110 Clearly, the high costs of
transportation constituted a serious problem for almost everyone involved in the cereal
trade, except perhaps the railroad companies.
Yet, the prohibitive cost o f transportation also gave local cereal producers a
substantial competitive edge against imported wheat and flour coming from United
States, India and more importantly, from the Black Sea basin. The wheat producers

located in the immediate hinterland of the leading towns benefited considerably from
the protection provided by the high costs of transportation prevailing in the region.
Apparently, this was an important factor that helped maintain cereal production in the
region during the depression ridden 1880s and the early 1890s.
During the early l$90s, the situation changed dramatically for local cereal
producers. The reduction of tariffs on goods travelling from Salonica towards Usktip in
1891 brought the interior urban markets within easier reach of Russian and American
producers.111 The construction of two new railway lines in the mid-1890s and the
subsequent reductions in tariffs also helped liberalise the urban markets of the interior
and intensified the competition faced by the local producers. The complaints of a group
of merchants from Manastir illustrate the adverse impact of the tariff reduction on local
trade. According to these merchants, the Oriental Railway Company charged O.L. 15
for a wagonload of flour arriving from Manastir to Salonica in 1896. In contrast, cheap
Russian flour coming from Salonica to Manastir was charged 40.0% less for the same
distance and paid only O.L. 9 in railway tariffs. Under the circumstances, the local
producers failed to market their produce and, more importantly, they faced intense
overseas competition not only in Salonica but also in the recently rail-linked towns of
the interior.112

Not surprisingly, regional cereal trade soon came under the orbit of American
and Russian trade. Trading houses of Salonica now increasingly preferred imported
cereals and flour over the more expensive and poor quality local produce.113 Thus, the
last bastion of local cereal producers, the domestic urban markets, fell to the hands of
foreign competitors. The region became a regular importer o f wheat and flour in the late
1900s.
Pressed hard under intense foreign competition both in overseas and domestic
markets, the adverse income effect of sluggish prices, and the prohibitive costs of
transportation, local cereal producers increasingly •turned towards alternative
agricultural pursuits. As relative prices turned in favour of cash crops (see Table 2.2),
farmers and landlords switched to the production of these more lucrative and less bulky
cash crops. Thus, regional cereal production went into a notable crisis from the turn of
the century onwards and emerged as a largely retarded sector by the end of the period.
The rapid growth o f cash crop production in the region must be associated, among other
things, with the sustained crisis in and the gradual retardation o f cereal production.
2.2. Cotton Cultivation: American Competition and the Blessing of the Domestic Market
Cotton was the single most important commercial crop of the Selanik region
until the 1860s. We know that cotton was cultivated in the fertile plains of Siroz and
was exported overseas as early as the sixteenth century.114 However, the real expansion
of cotton cultivation came later in the second half of the eighteenth century. Strong
overseas and local demand for cotton increased the attraction of cotton production for
local farmers.115 By c.1800, the districts of Siroz, Zihne, Yenice and Selanik had
become primary centres of cotton cultivation in the Ottoman Em pire.116 Cotton exports
from Salonica rose from 1,130 tons in the early 1750s to 1,630 tons in the late 1780s
and reached a peak o f 7,700 tons by c.1800.117 By the turn of the nineteenth century,

cotton had become the primary commercial crop of the region, generating about
6,000,000 kuru§QS in export' earnings.118
After the turn o f the nineteenth century local cotton producers began to run into
serious difficulties. Both overseas and domestic demand for local cotton varieties
contracted rapidly from the early 1810s onwards, pushing the sector into a severe
recession. The rapid mechanisation of cotton spinning in continental Europe proved
extremely injurious for overseas cotton trade o f Selanik. The short, hard and thick
cotton staple varieties produced in the region yielded satisfactory results in hand
spinning but they were not ideally suitable for mechanised mule spinners.119 The rough
cotton staple could not resist the strain o f mechanised spinners and frequently broke in
the spinning process. Breakage was a serious problem for mule technology. The entire
machine had to be stopped until the operators fixed the breakage. Given the consequent
productivity loss, most mill owners preferred the strong but soft American and Egyptian
cotton varieties that could resist the continuous motion of the mule spinner. The high
quality American cottons out-marketed the cotton varieties coming from the Levant.
The cotton produced in Selanik proved no exception. Exports from Salonica declined
from an all time high of about 13,000 tons in the late 1810s to less than 2,000 tons in the
early 1850s. By the early 1860s, cotton exports had fallen to merely 600 tons.120
The decline o f the local spinning industries from the 1820s onwards also struck a
heavy blow to regional cotton production. Mounting British competition in overseas and
later in domestic markets spawned the decline, indeed the collapse, o f artisanal cotton
spinning industry in the region as well as in Thessaly. This situation led to a further
contraction in the demand for local cotton and pushed the sector into a severe crisis
from the 1830s onwards. Production declined in all leading centres of cotton cultivation.
By the 1860s, regional cotton production yielded only 3,500 tons in all.121
The American Civil War brought about a short-lived recovery in cotton
production that lasted until the end o f the 1860s. The disruption in the American cotton
trade during the Civil War led to serious supply deficiencies throughout Europe and

forced European manufacturers to turn towards the old Levantine suppliers.122 Selanik
was among the regions that attracted the attention of European merchants. However, the
quality of the cotton staple produced in the region still constituted a serious and
potentially prohibitive problem. The Ottoman government, in cooperation with a group
of British merchants, took the initiative to improve the quality of cotton varieties
produced in the region. The authorities imported and distributed 40 tons of Egyptian and
64 tons of American cotton seeds in Selanik between 1863 and 1868. Local farmers
successfully adopted the new seed, which yielded satisfactory results both in quality and
quantity.123 In response, many farmers in Siroz and Zihne abolished the cultivation of
tobacco, sesame and cereals and switched to cotton. Consequently, regional cotton
production reached an all time high of 17,820 tons in 1867; about 11,000 tons were
exported, and the rest remained in local storehouses waiting for purchasers.

However, the cotton boom did not last long. The restoration of cotton production
in the United States in the aftermath of the Civil War brought about a swift contraction
in overseas demand for Levantine cottons.124 In Salonica, cotton prices plummeted by
37.0%, at an annual rate of 4.7%, between the early 1870s and the early 1880s. The
price of no other agricultural commodity, not even wheat, contracted so drastically.
These adverse price trends forced many producers out of cotton production and

compelled them to take up the production of more remunerative crops such as
tobacco125
Establishment o f a number of local cotton spinning concerns in the late 1870s
and the 1880s gave way to a partial recovery in cotton production.126 In response to the
fresh demand generated by new mills, cotton cultivation recovered in Siroz and Zihne.
In 1886 British consul Blunt reported that the “cultivation of cotton in Macedonia [was]
steadily [extending] owing to the establishment of cotton mills”.127 A year later the
recovery was still notable and "... the cultivation of [cotton]... [was] increasing annually
in the province owing to the progress made by the cotton manufactures”.128 An official
Ottoman report published in the provincial newspaper Selanik in 1888 underlined the
same connection between the emergence of local spinning concerns and the recovery in
cotton cultivation. The correspondent suggested that “the opening of spinning factories
in the vilayet caused an increase in the consumption of cotton and we have not the
slightest doubt that if our cultivators show energy and perseverance more awarding
results will be obtained than from cereal crops”.129
Meanwhile, the quality of the local cotton staple had again emerged as a
notorious problem. The cotton seeds imported during the American Civil War had
largely degenerated over time, due to climatic conditions and inadequate cleaning.130
The quality of cotton fibres deteriorated and the local cotton varieties fell short of
meeting the needs o f the local spinning concerns.
Nothing was done to improve the quality of local cotton varieties until the mid
1880s. Probably alarmed by the complaints o f local mill owners, the Ottoman
authorities took certain measures to restore the quality of cotton varieties in the
region.131 Upon orders from the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, 2,570 kgs of

new American seeds were imported and distributed to cotton producers in Salonica in
1886.132 Compared to earlier efforts, the scope o f this seed refreshment project was
small and yielded relatively limited results.133 As we shall see, the quality problem
remained unresolved until the turn of the twentieth century.
Regional cotton production turned increasingly towards the domestic markets in
the late 1890s and the early 1900s. The establishment of a number o f new spinning
concerns in Salonica, Agustos, Vodine and Karaferye increased the demand for cotton,
which gave way to a notable increase in cotton prices in Salonica. Moved by the price
increase, many farmers, especially the long frustrated cereal producers, switched to
cotton production. By 1895 regional cotton production had reached 3,000 tons and
probably continued to rise until the early 1900s. However, the degeneration o f cotton
seeds was now a notorious problem. Local mill owners were seriously considering
cotton imports from overseas as the local varieties fell short of meeting the specific
technical requirements o f the mechanised ring spinners, which were commonly used in
local mills.134 In response, the local authorities, in cooperation with the leading cotton
merchants and yam producers o f the region, imported 40 tons of cotton seed from the
United States and Izmir and distributed them to farmers in Siroz and Zihne in 1898.135
Apparently, the scheme was successful and the new imported seeds, especially the ones
coming from the Izmir region, yielded satisfactory results.136 As such, domestic
production could be maintained around 3,000 tons throughout the 1890s and the early
1900s.137 Cotton imports into Salonica remained insignificant during this period.
The unprecedented growth in the tobacco business in the region seriously
undermined regional cotton production after the turn o f the century. As relative prices
turned in favour o f tobacco, many farmers, including the cotton cultivators of Siroz and
Zihne switched to the cultivation o f tobacco138 In 1905, regional cotton production had
declined by almost a third and yielded no ,more than 2,100 tons in total. This decline
troubled the Ottoman government, for the growing attraction of tobacco production in
132 F.O.A.S., 1888, N. 348: 2; PRO, F.O. 78/4119, Extract from the Salonica Gazette, 1.5.1888. 133 D.T.O.G., 25.Ra.1305 (11.12.1887), No. 154: 3. 134 Asir, 26.N.1315 (17.2.1898), N. 254: 2,D.T.O.G., 5.L.1315 (26.2.1898), N. 686: 68-69 135 BA, §D-Ticaret, 1213/17, 21.N.1316 (4.2.1899). 136 D.T.O.G., 5.L.1315 (26.2.1898), N. 686: 68-69; Asir, 23.N.1322 (1.1.1904), N. 935: 2.

the region, at the expense of cotton, meant revenue losses. As cotton cultivators of
Zihne and Salonica turned into tobacco producers, they began to pay their taxes to the
PDA rather than the Ottoman Revenue Administration.139 Concerned by the growing
fiscal predominance of the PDA, the government authorities attempted, rather in vain, to
counterbalance the growing attraction o f tobacco cultivation in the region and tried to
keep farmers in cotton production as long as possible. These efforts, as before,
concentrated mainly on the improvement of the quality of local cotton varieties. The
anticipation was that better quality cotton would fetch higher prices and render cotton
production still attractive for local farmers. Seed distribution schemes continued during
the late 1900s.140
In addition, efforts were made to improve the quality o f the marketed output.
The ginners in the countryside were in the habit of manipulating the machines so as to
obtain higher cotton turnouts. However, such manipulated machines did a poor job of
cleaning debris and the seeds the cotton contained and, perhaps more importantly, they
seriously damaged the cotton fibre. The cotton thus ginned fetched lower prices in
Salonica.141 To prevent such fraudulent practices and to secure the quality of the locally
ginned cotton produce, the Ottoman government appointed officials from local councils
and agricultural inspectors to examine the ginning machines in Siroz and Zihne districts
and authorised them to seal off the faulty machines.142
Evidently, these efforts could do little to regenerate growth in regional cotton
cultivation. The attraction of tobacco production was simply overwhelming. By 1912,
regional cotton cultivation yielded only 2,000 tons.143 Under the circumstances, local
mills turned increasingly towards overseas suppliers and began to import cotton
regularly from other Levantine markets, especially from the Adana, Izmir and Aleppo
regions. A leading centre of cotton production had become dependent on imports by
1912.
139 See below for the collection of tobacco and silk taxes by the PDA. 140 BA, Irade-TicaretyeNafia, 441/4319-7,26.S.1324 (20.4.1906).

Thus, regional cotton production lost ground in both overseas and domestic
markets, due to a combination of complex structural and conjunctural factors. First, the
contraction o f overseas demand and the intensifying competition in domestic markets
seem to have constituted an adverse economic climate for cotton producers and
underlined the decline of the sub-sector in the long-term. Many farmers ultimately
turned away from cotton cultivation and sought new opportunities in the rapidly
growing tobacco business. Secondly, the lack of regulatory bodies and an institutional
framework that could help support and sustain medium and long-term growth processes
made a significant difference between growth and retardation. The failure to maintain
the quality o f cotton seeds and o f the marketed produce were the manifestations of this
institutional weakness. In this regard, cotton producers shared a similar fate with cereal
cultivators.
3. Agricultural Production under Overseas Influence:
3.1. Silk Production: Disaster and Recovery:
Sericulture had for long been a principal agrarian pursuit in the region. The
districts o f Selanik and Kesendire had already emerged as important centres of
sericulture in the eighteenth century. The silk produced and spun by local farmers was
sent regularly to the Italian peninsula and France, as well as to a number of important
Levantine towns such as Bursa and Izmir.144 In addition, the silk cloth weavers of
Salonica consumed considerable amounts of locally produced silk in weaving the
famous headgears (turban) worn by the Janissary corps and the special silken bath
towels (pe§temal) commonly used throughout the Ottoman Empire.145
The sector continued to expand during the first half o f the nineteenth century.
According to one contemporary estimate, regional silk output was around 12,000 kg at
around the turn o f the century. By 1845, raw silk production had reached 43,000 kg in
the town o f Salonica alone.146 The growth of the sector in this period, as before, owed

much to the buoyancy o f overseas and domestic demand for the yam and various cloth
varieties produced in the region. The mechanisation of silk production in the region, and
the subsequent improvements in the quality and, perhaps more importantly, the
consistency o f local produce, enhanced its marketability in the overseas markets.147
This expansionary process was interrupted from the late 1850s onwards, due
mainly to a supply side shock superimposed by the appearance o f virulent silkworm
disease, namely pebrine, in the region.148 The disease first surfaced in France in the
mid-1850s and spread rapidly, causing much devastation in almost all leading centres of
sericulture in Europe and the Mediterranean basin.149 The disease spread rapidly in
Selanik and seriously undermined regional silk cocoon production in the 1860s.
Frustrated with the persistence of the disease, many producers abandoned sericulture
and either left their mulberry groves unattended or simply uprooted trees and converted
the groves into arable land during this period.150
The sector entered a phase of remarkable recovery from the early 1870s
onwards. This recovery was linked primarily to the successful containment of the
pebrine disease in the region. From the early 1870s onwards, the local sericulturists
started importing pebrine-frQQ silkworm eggs raised in accordance with the Pasteur
method. Initial experimentations with the sterilised (French) eggs were quite successful
and yielded encouraging results in both quality and quantity. However, failures and
frustrating results were also quite common during the early years of recovery. Many
farmers purchased incredulous silkworm eggs at bargain prices and soon realised that
147 At the time, European silk weaving industries were turning increasingly towards mechanisation. Technically, it was imperative to use consistent silk threads in order to assure prime results in mechanised weaving. Otherwise the pieces turned out to be extremely poor in quality. Even though some consistency could be achieved in hand reeling, the results obtained in mechanised reeling were more satisfactory. The rise of mechanised spinning in Salonica enabled the sector to turn increasingly towards the overseas markets. In fact, throughout the early nineteenth century, raw silk exports to the Italian peninsula, France and the Levant grew rapidly to reach 43,000 kg in the early 1850s. See Svoronos, Le commerce de Salonique, 260, and Themopoulou, Salonique, 468, for the growth of regional silk production and mechanised reeling in Salonica.
148 Both production and exports of silk almost collapsed in this period. According to Themopoulou’s figures Salonica silk production diminished down to 10,000 kg. See Themopoulou, Salonique, 468.

the eggs were badly infected. Crops failed disastrously and the cultivators incurred
heavy losses. Despite these failed attempts, however, the widespread introduction of
imported pebrine-free eggs underlined the beginnings of a quick recovery in
sericulture.151
More successful results in combating the disease were achieved in the late 1870s
and the 1880s. In 1876, the Ottoman government banned the importation and sale of
eggs that had not been raised and inspected in accordance with the Pasteur method.152
This legislation was intended to prevent the infected eggs from entering the Ottoman
production cycle. Apparently, the regulation served its purpose and helped improve the
quality of egg varieties imported and sold in the region. Soon, local sericulturists started
using, quite commonly, the prime quality Gamier and Fabre eggs imported from
France.153 Also, alternative egg suppliers found increasing appeal among local cocoon
producers. Large quantities o f silkworm eggs were imported from Japan and the United
States.154
Thus, the condition of the silkworm eggs improved noticeably within a decade,
owing much to the efforts of local silk cocoon producers and merchants. By the early
1880s, considerable progress had been made in combating the epidemic, and the
silkworm disease was diminishing in important centres of production.155 By the late
1880s, the disease had almost entirely disappeared from the region.156 Mulberry
plantations and silk cocoon production were expanding in primary centres of sericulture
such as Selanik, Gevgeli and Kesendire.157 In addition, the sector was making
considerable progress in other parts of the province. In Karaferye for instance, an
increasing number o f people turned towards cocoon production. The development of the
sector was particularly impressive around the town of Agustos, where the farmers began
to plant new mulberry trees.158 Production expanded in other parts of the region such as

These developments took place under quite favourable market conditions. The
recovery of the silk industries in France, Italy and in such leading Ottoman centres of
silk production as Bursa and Izmit provided the sector with some fresh demand
stimulus. Consequently, cocoon prices began to rise from the early 1870s onwards.160 In
1871, silk cocoons fetched \ l d per pound. By the mid-1870s, the prices had risen
massively to an average of 70d per pound.161 Later in the 1880s, the upward price trend
was somewhat arrested due to mounting Japanese competition in overseas markets.
Consequently, cocoon prices in Salonica fell down to an average of 5Id. Nevertheless,
buoyant overseas and domestic demand for local produce helped maintain regional
cocoon prices well above the pre-1875 levels (See Table 2.5).162
The swift rise in silk cocoon prices during the late 1870s and their relative
stability throughout the 1880s constituted a strong market incentive to take up
sericulture in the region. In the early 1890s, the provincial Ottoman authorities were
reporting that remunerative prices served as the main motivation for farmers to take up
silk cocoon production in the province of Karaferye.163 Similar market signals
encouraged other farmers to turn to silk cocoon production in districts of Selanik,

Vodine, Gevgeli and Kesendire. Overall, this commercial dynamic seems to have been
the underlining force in the recovery of the sector.164
By the early 1890s, regional silk cocoon production had already made a
considerable recovery and this expansionary process continued throughout the 1890s
and the 1900s. This time, however, the expansion of the sector took place under
relatively unfavourable demand side conditions, at least in the overseas markets. The
rapid recovery of sericulture in Europe and the Levant and the general rise in world silk
production, led to a notable downturn in silk cocoon prices. Selanik proved no
exception and local prices started to decline from the early 1890s onwards. However,
the sector continued to grow during this period. In the early 1890s, regional silk cocoon
production yielded about 1,300 tons. By 1907, regional production had gone up by
26.4% to reach 1,643 tons.165
The continued dynamism and growth o f the sector cannot be attributed to the
buoyancy of overseas demand. Growing Japanese competition in international markets
seriously hurt Selanik’s silk cocoon exports, which declined from 371 tons in 1890 to
246 tons in the late 1890s.166 The institutional support of the PDA and the expansion of
the domestic demand for local silk produce were primary factors that sustained the
dynamism of the sector.
The PDA actively encouraged the recovery and growth of sericulture in the
region during the 1890s and the 1900s. PDA officials concentrated their efforts mainly
on supplying mulberry plants free o f charge to farmers willing to take up silk cocoon
production. One o f the pressing problems of regional silk cocoon production in the late
1880s was the scarcity of mulberry plants. As has already been noted, during the
depression years, many frustrated farmers uprooted their mulberry groves. The recovery
of the 1870s and the 1880s increased the demand for mulberry leaves. Despite the
plantation of new trees and the improvement of existing groves in some parts of the
region, severe mulberry leaf shortages emerged throughout, forcing local mulberry leaf
prices to rise.167 The immediate priority of the PDA was to tackle this supply side

problem. In 1891, the PDA officials imported 5,000 mulberry plants from Bursa and
distributed them to farmers willing to take up sericulture. Next year, the scope of the
project was extended, and additional 24,000 plants were distributed.168 The distribution
schemes probably continued throughout the late 1890s and the 1900s and became better
structured with the establishment of a mulberry plantation at the agricultural school in
Salonica.169 The PDA’s efforts bore fruit. Silk cocoon production spread further into a
number of new locations in the province. In districts such as Avrethisan, Katrin,
Longaza and Razlik silk cocoon production was virtually nonexistent in the 1880s. By
the 1900s, these districts too had become important centres of silk cocoon production.170
The PDA also took certain measures that helped ensure the quality of silkworm
eggs imported into the region. As we have seen, the quality o f eggs used by the local
sericulturists had improved notably, owing much to the importation of disease free egg
varieties from France, U.S. and Japan. The establishment o f a silkworm egg factory by
the Alatini Brothers in Salonica must have also helped improve the quality of the eggs
used by the local silkworm raisers.171 However, it seems that some infected or weak egg
varieties still found their way into the production cycle, and indeed, cheap imported
eggs from France and Italy that did not carry an inspection ‘banderol’ turned out to be
defective.172 The PDA, in cooperation with the Ottoman government, attempted to
prevent this problem. First, a department of sericulture was established in the
agricultural school near Salonica in the early 1900s and the silkworm eggs raised there
were sold to producers at relatively low prices. Thus, the producers enjoyed a viable
alternative to the cheap, uninspected eggs coming from Europe. Second, a special egg
inspection committee was established in Salonica in 1906. The committee included
Nesib Bey, the chief agricultural inspector of Salonica, Ihsan Efendi, a sericulture
expert from the Agricultural School, and a number o f officials from the PDA. The
committee inspected samples from imported eggs, refusing the ones failing to adhere to
the standards set by the Pasteur procedure.173 Apparently, the inspections were thorough

and covered all eggs imported into the region, regardless of the label they carried.174
These efforts probably improved the quality of silk cocoons produced in the region. In
fact, contemporary sources explicitly attribute the growth o f production and exports in
the late 1900s to the improvement in the quality of silk cocoons produced in the
region.175
Finally, the expansion of domestic demand was another factor that underlined
the growth o f the sector during the 1890s and the 1900s. Revival of silk reeling
industries accompanied the containment of the pebrine disease and the subsequent
recovery of sericulture in the region. Numerous filatures equipped with modem
technology were opened in the environs o f Salonica, Vodine and especially in Gevgeli.
Most o f these filatures were owned by private entrepreneurs, but the PDA, too,
established a number o f model filatures to encourage silk reeling in the region.176 The
proliferating cotton and silk weaving industries consumed an increasing share o f the silk
yam produced in the region.177 The regeneration of silk reeling and the buoyancy of
demand for the silken cloth varieties in local, especially urban, markets and in other
Ottoman towns, created a demand dynamic that underlined the sustained growth of silk
cocoon production in the region during the 1890s and the 1900s.
At any rate, silk production was overall a success in Selanik during the period
under consideration. The recovery from an epidemic that was highly contagious and
difficult to contain must be considered a considerable success, given the difficulties
encountered throughout Europe in combating the disease. The expansion of sericulture
in the region in spite o f mounting Japanese competition and declining prices is another
indicator of the remarkable vigour o f the sub-sector at large. This vigour derived from
the buoyancy of home demand for locally produced silk, on the one hand, and the
institutional support provided by the PDA and, to a lesser extent, the Ottoman
government on the other. These demand side dynamics and institutional factors enabled
sericulture to grow during the late 1890s and the early 1900s. A similar, if not more
dramatic, picture also prevailed in the case of tobacco production.
174 xhese inspection of French eggs carrying the official bandroles o f inspection by the committee in Salonica led to the protests of the French government at both consular and embassy levels.

3.2. Tobacco Cultivation: Monopolies, Regulations and Foreign Trading Houses
Tobacco production was a long established agrarian pursuit in Selanik. Locally
grown tobacco had found regular purchasers in Europe and throughout the
Mediterranean basin at least since the seventeenth century.178 Besides, local people
regularly consumed unusually large amounts of local tobacco, thus adding to the overall
demand for local tobacco varieties.179 The local population, as well as European and
Mediterranean consumers, favoured the local tobacco varieties for their smoking quality
and flavour. In particular, Katrin, Kir, San §aban, Yenice, iske?e and Gumulcine
varieties were favoured for their distinct sweet and smooth taste and appealing
yellowish colour. Other lower quality tobacco varieties, such as Provide and Daridere,
were ideal for blending purposes and added flavour and smoothness to the relatively
strong Virgina tobacco varieties.180
Local tobacco production grew rapidly during the eighteenth century, owing
mainly to the robustness of domestic and especially overseas demand. Output figures
are not available for earlier periods, but we know that tobacco production yielded about
10,000 tons in Yenice and Drama alone in c. 1800.181 Considering that regional tobacco
production yielded about 18,000 tons in its golden era, just before the Balkan Wars, we
can confidently assume that production probably increased rapidly during the century.
Export figures confirm this observation. According to Svoronos, exports rose rapidly
from a mere 1,000 tons in 1750 to reach 9,000 tons in c.1800.182
After the turn o f the nineteenth century, tobacco production in Selanik ran into
serious difficulties. The efforts o f the Ottoman government to bring tobacco production

under tighter fiscal control had a retarding effect on regional tobacco production. The
government used the internal custom duties and a number of other surcharges to
maximise the revenues accruing from tobacco trade during the first half of the
nineteenth century.183 Squeezed under regressive taxation and prohibitive tariffs and
duties, many producers simply gave up tobacco cultivation and switched to the
production of alternative crops such as cotton. By the 1860s, regional tobacco
production had fallen to 6,000 tons in total.184
Heavy taxation practices o f the Ottoman government also encouraged many
merchants and producers to turn increasingly towards contraband trade. The tobacco
trade conducted with Egypt as well as with other Levantine markets came under the
orbit of contraband trade. In response, the Ottoman government declared tobacco a state
monopoly in 1861, so as to consolidate its control over the tobacco trade and to prevent
further revenue losses. The government banned imports to eliminate all foreign
competition in the domestic markets. A wide range of new fiscal regulations and
administrative measures were also instituted to consolidate the monopoly’s fiscal grip
over tobacco production. Taxes were simplified. The standard 10% tithe remained in
effect. In addition, all the excise taxes and customs duties previously claimed were
consolidated under a new surcharge of 12 kuru$es per okka, which was called the
mururiye (passage) charge. The mururiye was to be collected in cash and directly from
the person selling the produce in local markets. Officials were appointed to collect the
mururiye charges at local' fairs and market places.185 However, the export trade still
remained outside the fiscal reach of the Ottoman government. The tobacco destined for
exports remained exempt from the mururiye charges, mainly due to the pressure exerted
by the European powers. Also, the tobacco sold in Istanbul was exempt from mururiye,
and the importers in Istanbul were responsible for the payment of the surcharge.186
The immediate impact o f the government monopoly on tobacco production in
Selanik is hard to discern. Available evidence suggest that the introduction of the
mururiye charge proved extremely injurious to the farmers producing lower quality
tobaccos for consumption in domestic markets. In fact, some o f these producers were

compelled to abandon tobacco cultivation because of the fiscal burden of the new
levy.187 Contraband trade appears to have grown rapidly during the same period and the
tobacco trade with the Albanian provinces and Egypt fell increasingly outside the
immediate fiscal reach of the Ottoman government.
Upon its financial bankruptcy in the mid 1870s, the Ottoman government agreed
to cede the tax revenues accruing from excise taxes and monopolies over to a group of
Istanbul bankers in 1879. The ensuing consortium of bankers, commonly known as the
Riisumat-i Sitte Idaresi (Administration of Six Revenues, ASR), was to remain in.
control of these revenues for the next ten years. The revenues ceded to the consortium
would be used to serve the outstanding Ottoman debt.188 Within this context, all the
revenue accruing from the tobacco monopoly was put under to the management of the
ASR.189
The establishment o f the ASR led to the tightening of monopoly controls over
the production and sale of tobacco The tobacco monopoly followed a hard line in
taxation and managed to tune the tithe returns to levels o f production in a more direct
fashion, leaving relatively little room for tax evasion.190 The monopoly also tightened
controls to eliminate contraband trade. As I have noted above, the tobacco trade
conducted with certain Ottoman provinces, and especially with Egypt, increasingly
became contraband over the last decade and a half. Many European merchants shipped
the tobacco produce first to Malta, as if it were destined for exports, but then forwarded.
the produce to Egypt. Merchants avoided the mururiye charges they would have paid
had they sent the produce directly to Egypt. This practice inflicted considerable losses
on the tobacco monopoly. The monopoly, in cooperation with local customs, began to
set up insurmountable difficulties for tobacco exports to Malta in an effort to bring the
trade with Egypt under its control.191
The preventive measures o f the monopoly caused outrage among European
merchants. The attitude o f the monopoly and customs authorities led to repeated

protests at both consular and embassy levels. The issue remained unresolved for a
decade and was ultimately settled in favour of European trading houses in the late
1880s.192 However, it is important to note that this was the first recorded attempt of a
tobacco monopoly to bring the tobacco trade in Ottoman lands under its control.
Despite trade restrictions and heavy taxation, tobacco production and trade
continued to expand in Selanik at least until the early 1880s. Once again, the dynamism
of overseas demand generated considerable growth in the sector. Especially, the demand
coming from Austria-Hungary, Russia, the Italian peninsula and France, in addition to
Istanbul, constituted a boon to local tobacco production and largely underscored its
expansion in this period. In 1883, the British Consul General Blunt was reporting that
“tobacco is by a long way the leading product in the sancak of Drama where its
cultivation is a very successful and paying industry and increases annually
notwithstanding the heavy taxes it is subject to”.193 According to Blunt, local tobacco
cultivation reached a prime state of perfection and the exports formed the most
important part o f the trade by 1885.194
The formation of a new tobacco monopoly, Societe de la Regie Cointeresee des
Tabacs de VEmpire Ottomane (Regie hereafter) in 1884, marked a watershed in regional
tobacco production. The Regie was an offshoot o f the PDA and was responsible for the
collection and the management o f the tithes accruing from tobacco production. In
addition, unlike the previous Ottoman tobacco monopoly, the Regie was endowed with
far reaching privileges that enabled it to control the production, processing and
marketing of tobacco cultivated in the empire.195
According to the regulations governing the production and sale o f tobacco in the
empire, the Regie was obliged to grant permits and to extend short term credits for those
willing to take up tobacco cultivation.196 Tobacco grown without a valid permit was

considered contraband and could be confiscated by the Regie authorities. In addition,
tobacco cultivation on plots smaller than half a donum and behind stone walls was
forbidden so as to prevent petty smuggling. All permits had to be renewed on a yearly
basis. The Regie was obliged to buy all the tobacco other than the produce sold to
merchants for export purposes. When the Regie bought the produce, the Regie.
authorities weighed the produce after the harvest and the price was determined through
a though bargaining session between the producer and the representatives of the Regie.
In case o f irreconcilable disagreements, a third party, usually the village headmen or a
local notable, was called in to help settle the dispute. Once an agreement was reached,
the producers were expected to hand in the tobacco to the nearest Regie depot at their
own expense. Upon delivery, the cultivator was given a certificate stating the quality,
amount, and the value of the produce.
The Regie paid for storage for the first six months, but thereafter the owners
incurred all storage expenses. If the product remained in the depots for two years
without actually being purchased by the Regie, then the owners could ask the produce to
be auctioned and sold for export. If the produce could be sold through auctioning, then
the producer would receive the net sum after the deduction of storage expenses..
Otherwise, the Regie was obliged to purchase the tobacco immediately at a price
determined through the mediation o f third parties. At any rate, after the actual purchase,
the Regie withheld the tithe from the producers and handed it over to the PDA at the end
of each month. When the produce was sold for export, then the merchants were held
accountable for the payment o f the tithe directly to the Regie at a rate o f 10.0% of the
sale value of the produce. Finally, all the produce purchased by the Regie was
processed, priced and sold by the Regie. The Regie could also export the cigarettes and
numerous tobacco goods produced in its factories and workshops. Import restrictions
remained in effect.
The entry o f the Regie into the local tobacco scene initially led to a rapid
expansion o f tobacco cultivation in the region. Behind this expansionary process lay the
competition between the Regie and trading houses. Habitually, the trading houses and.
merchants operating in the region extended credits to producers prior to the cultivation
of the tobacco plants on the basis of the understanding that they would be the sole
purchaser o f the final produce at the going market prices after the harvest. This practice
was commonly known as -“booking” (peyleme). Local merchants and the agents of
116


trading companies would often refuse to buy the tobacco produce previously “booked”
by other merchants and agents, so as to circumscribe the bargaining power of the
producers and to prevent cutthroat competition in the pricing process.197 Competition
would take place prior to “booking”, when merchants and agents competed to secure the
privilege to buy the best tobacco produce by extending short-term credits to local
farmers. In this environment, taking part in the tobacco trade required a solid presence
within the local marketing networks and a firm access to credit markets. Thus, only the
agents o f large European trading houses, well-connected local firms, and some
prominent landlords and moneylenders were able to maintain a solid presence in
regional tobacco markets. Smaller merchants were marginalised largely in spot markets;
they either traded in inferior tobacco varieties or acted as agents cum commissioners of
larger players.198 In this context, the practice of “booking” emerged as a means of
securing a solid market share for large players in the regional tobacco trade without
having to inflate purchasing prices.
The Regie entered regional tobacco markets quite forcefully and extended
credits to local farmers who were willing to take up tobacco cultivation. The Regie
expected to consolidate its control over processes of production and marketing. Thus, it
could conveniently drive other competitors, especially the competing foreign trading
houses, off the markets and assume a de facto monopoly position. It could then buy the
best tobacco at favourable prices, tax the cultivators, process the tobacco, manufacture
cigarettes, and sell them both for domestic consumption and exports under quite
favourable terms. As we shall see, the primary motive of the Regie remained unaltered
in the following decades and focused on the elimination of market competition in
tobacco trade.
The liberal credit policies o f the Regie and the competing trading houses induced
a rapid expansion of tobacco cultivation, particularly in the district of Drama.199
However, the extraordinary “boom” conditions did not last long. The aggressive credit
policy o f the Regie served its purpose and forced many competing merchants out of the
tobacco market. The smaller players were out-competed by the Regie. The Regie
liberally used credits and cultivation permits to “encourage”, if not compel, the tobacco

cultivators to sell their produce directly to the Regie, rather than to the agents and
representatives o f the trading houses that conducted the bulk of overseas trade in the
region.200 Besides, under the new regulations, the merchants, instead o f the producers,
were obliged to pay the tithes directly to the Regie. This new fiscal burden probably put
some of the small merchants at a disadvantage and helped elevate the Regie to a
commanding position in local tobacco markets. In fact, within a few years the Regie and
the Austrian tobacco monopoly Hertzog Company emerged as the primary purchasers in
regional tobacco markets and were quite capable of controlling prices.201 Under the
circumstances, the expected price rise never materialised (see Table 2.6). Quite to the
contrary, regional tobacco prices started to decline notably from 1885 onwards, putting
many indebted tobacco producers under financial strain. Besides, the complex practice
of obtaining cultivation permits and the tobacco cultivators’ obligation to transport their
produce over to the Regie depots at their own expense created additional problems.202
Pressed hard under sluggish prices and restrictive, and sometimes costly, regulations,
some farmers abandoned tobacco cultivation.203
The Regie also adopted a hardline policy to combat smuggling and contraband
trade. Through a network o f inspectors, controllers and armed guards, the Regie
attempted to prevent the illegal production and sale of tobacco as strictly as possible.
Producers with a history or a presumed tendency to engage in contraband trade were
instantly denied permits of production. This restrictive practice was in fact against the
regulations, which obliged the Regie to issue permits to anyone willing to take up
tobacco production on open fields over half a donum. Nevertheless, the Regie officials,
despite protests from the Ottoman government, continued to punish, sometimes
unfairly, some tobacco producers suspected o f engaging in contraband trade and
cooperating with the intermediary merchants.204 It seems that the carrot (credits) and

administrative and fiscal control, at least in the primary centres of tobacco cultivation.205

At the same time, in cooperation with the customs authorities in Kavala and
Salonica, the Regie attempted to prevent the contraband Egyptian trade conducted
through Malta. The British merchants willing to trade with Malta were asked for
authentic certificates, which were to be received directly from the British customs
authorities in London or Liverpool. Otherwise, the tobacco in which these merchants
dealt would be considered contraband and denied clearance from the ports of Salonica
and Kavala. As before, the restrictive measures of the Regie led to protests by British
merchants and their local agents at the consular and embassy levels.206 Eventually, the
conflict was resolved in favour of the British merchants in 1888, who were allowed to
carry on their trade through Malta without restrictions.207 Nevertheless, the Regie's
efforts to prevent contraband tobacco trade with Egypt via Malta, proved useful to the
Regie in causing problems for intermediary merchants. In this sense, the Regie seems to
have used its anti-contraband stance quite rhetorically to circumscribe the commercial
influence of export companies and their agents in regional tobacco markets.
Despite the Regie's strong presence however, overseas trade with Europe,
Istanbul and the Black Sea basin continued to expand during the 1880s, and exports rose

to about 5,139 tons in 1886 to 8,556 tons in 1897.208 In this respect, contrary to the
claims of British consuls, the Regie did not really hinder exports. It simply dominated
the tobacco markets much to the annoyance o f the British, French and Italian trading
concerns operating in the region.209
The advent of the late-1890s saw crucial transformations in regional tobacco
trade. In February 12, 1894, the Regie subcontracted its commercial transactions to
Banque de Salonique according to an agreement signed between the two institutions on
February 12, 1894. In turn, the Banque set up the Commercial Company o f Salonica
Limited in London on March 14, 1895. The Commercial Company was granted the
exclusive right to purchase and sell tobacco, cigarettes and cigars in and out of the
region at prices set by the Regie. The Alatini, Fernandez, Misrachi, Salem, Morpurgo
and other leading merchant families of Salonica controlled the Company. The profits
were to be shared between the Commercial Company (30.0%) and the Regie (70.0%)
after the deduction o f a 5.0% share for reserve, 5.0% for interest payments, and an
additional 7.5% for the administrative council of the province.210
Two primary reasons appear to have prompted this arrangement. First, the Regie
lost considerable amounts of money due to the liberal credit policies it pursued during
the previous decade, and evidently, it wanted to step back from the competitive risks of
commercial transactions in tobacco trade. Secondly, the cost incurred through
commercial transactions could be avoided through subcontracting, so that the Regie
could simply capitalise on the profits accruing from the sale of tobacco, without really
having to carry the economic and administrative burden of regulating and supervising
market transactions. The contract was signed with the strongest and most respected of
all the commercial and financial concerns operating in the region. Therefore, there was
little risk in sub-contracting. Following the establishment of the Commercial Company,
the Regie was engaged predominantly in the taxation of tobacco production and the
207 PRO, F.O. 78/4119, Pecchioli to Blunt, 2.4.1888. 208 See Table 1.7.
2®9 As has been implied, by the early 1890s, the Regie had become the primary purchaser in tobacco markets, together with the Austria-Hungarian tobacco monopoly, the Hertzog Company, and the two concerns conducted bulk o f overseas trade through Salonica and especially through the port of Kavala, much to the annoyance o f the British, Italian and French. See D.T.O.G., 15.N.1305 (26.5.188), N. 178: 203; D.T.O.G., 4.Za.l307 (21.6.1890), N. 286: 295; F.O.A.S., 1896, N. 1663: 3-4.

prevention of contraband trade. From 1895 onwards, it simply withdrew from
commercial transactions associated with tobacco production.211
This subcontracting arrangement was based on mutual interests. The merchant
families, which had a major stake in the Banque de Salonique, could, and in fact did,
benefit immensely from the sub-contracting arrangement. The trade was profitable and
through their financial resources and solid presence in local marketing networks, the
merchant families could virtually dominate the local tobacco trade. Indeed, in 1896
1897, the Commercial Company entered regional tobacco markets quite aggressively
and made large purchases of tobacco That year, the tobacco sales for Commercial
Company reached 3,100 tons, which was about 40.0% of the entire tobacco produce of
the region at the time. In the following years, the tobacco sales of Commercial Company
increased steadily and by the turn o f the century the concern had already become the
primary purchaser o f tobacco in the region. Its sales reached 4,180 tons in 1900-1901
and climbed to 6,180 tons in 1902-1903.212 In these years, regional tobacco production
yielded an annual average o f about 8,000 tons; so the Commercial Company captured at
least 75.0% o f the tobacco trade. The produce bought by the Commercial Company was
sold both in the domestic and overseas markets, but most of the produce was sent
overseas, especially to United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, France and Istanbul. Thus, it is
reasonable to assume that the bulk of the export trade was also conducted by the
Commercial Company, with the possible exception of Austria-Hungarian trade, which
was conducted exclusively by the Hertzog Company.213
By the turn o f the nineteenth century regional tobacco trade had become largely
oligopolistic. The booking convention continued all along and enabled the two primary
players, the Hertzog Company and the Commercial Company, to control purchasing
prices at the expense o f the tobacco producers.214 Local agents and prominent notables
and landlords played a crucial role in this process. Usually, the agents would book the
produce of entire villages and sometimes sub-districts, prior to the harvests. Once the
tobacco was harvested, the agents would arrive at the local markets and bargain first
with the prominent landlord o f the district. Upon apparently dramatic and rumpus
211 Pech, Manuel des Societes, 203; Asir, 27.N.1313 (11.3.1896), N. 53: 1. 212 Pech, Afanuel des Societes, 203. 213 Asir, 18.N.1320 (11.12.1902), N.742: I; Asir, 14.Za.1320 (12.2.1903), N.757: 1.

bargaining, the landlord would accept with great disappointment and often outrage a
considerably low price for his quality tobacco. Thus, the price would be set for the
entire village or sub-district and other smaller producers and sharecroppers would have
to sell their produce at the same ‘market’ price to the agents. Behind closed doors, the
prominent landlord would not only get a handsome commission, but would in fact
receive a higher price than the rate negotiated publicly.215 As such, the actual
purchasing price was controlled and handsome profits accrued to landlords, agents and
the export companies.
The civil war in Cuba and the subsequent American-Spanish War induced a
notable rise in global tobacco prices from 1896 onwards. The Commercial Company
benefited from the price rise and generated its highest ever profits between 1896-1898.
In 1896, 3.3 million kuru§es were distributed to shareholders. In 1897, the profits
reached a record 7.8 million kuru$es, although they fell to 4.3 million kuru§QS in the
following year.216 Clearly, the company’s oligopolistic control over the domestic
tobacco markets and its capacity to mediate the purchase prices in cooperation with the
Hertzog Company secured' handsome profits for the company. However, the Cuban
conflict and the Spanish War also induced American tobacco concerns to show growing
interest in the high quality tobacco varieties produced in Selanik. American companies
entered regional markets and made considerable purchases from 1897 onwards.217 After
a few years o f regular trading and preliminary networking, American tobacco concerns
established permanent offices in Kavala and Xanthia in 1902.218 The firms pursued an
extremely aggressive pricing policy, and, contrary to the spirit of the booking
convention began to offer higher prices and credits to producers.219 Thus, within a few
years, American tobacco concerns, especially Johnston Mayer Company, rose to
prominence in local tobacco trade, at the expense of the established oligopolies.220
The increasing overseas demand for local tobacco varieties and the intensifying
competition between the tobacco concerns operating in the region led to a substantial

rise in regional tobacco prices.221 Rising prices encouraged many farmers to switch to
tobacco cultivation in this period. Production boomed in Drama, Kavala, San-§aban and
Yenice and spread rapidly into new locations, such as Avrethisan, Karaferye,
Demirhisar, Nevrekop, Gevgeli and Siroz, which were better known as the leading
cereal and cotton producing districts of the region.222 Production increased from 7,500
tons in 1897 to 11,750 tons in 1907. Exports also rose proportionately from 8,556 to
9,479 tons during the same period.223
The dynamism and growth o f the sector appears to have continued until the eve
of the Balkan Wars. According to one estimate, tobacco production in Selanik probably
yielded about 18,000 tons, and exports from the entire Macedonian hinterland reached
an all time high o f 18,889 tons in 1912.224 Clearly, tobacco cultivation constituted the
most dynamic sector of the regional economy during the period under consideration.
Despite strong American and European presence in regional markets, the Regie
remained in control o f local tobacco production. It issued cultivation permits, collected
the tithes and led the efforts to prevent smuggling. On all fronts, the Regie acted quite
rigorously. Even though the Commercial Company conducted the commercial
transactions o f the Regie, the producers who, for one reason or another, could not sell
their produce to intermediary merchants and agents for export purposes often brought
their produce to the Regie depots.225 This was an important advantage for the local
tobacco producers as it secured the sale of their produce regardless o f the prevailing
market condition, because the Regie was obliged to purchase all the produce grown
legally within the region. However, this convention also posed serious problems for the
cultivators. The Regie depots were not always situated in the vicinity of their villages.
The cultivators, possibly small-scale producers, were at times obliged to carry their
produce over long distances. Delays were quite common, and in fact, the producers who

engaged in contraband trade.226 Besides, some depots were in a deplorable state;
tobacco bales were thrown on top of each other and lay unattended for months before
they were actually bought by the Commercial Company.221
The producers engaged in smuggling were, whenever caught, punished severely
by the Regie authorities. At times, the Regie carried out unfairly executed confiscations.
For instance, when harvests turned out to be poor, the Regie realised that the produce
fell short o f the initial output estimates set by its officers prior to the realisation of the
harvest. Thus, many producers faced charges of involvement in illegal contraband trade
and they were quite unfairly punished by the Regie authorities. Similarly, when harvests
turned out to be bountiful, the Regie accused the farmers of undertaking illegal tobacco
cultivation on plots larger than initially reported to the representatives o f the R egie228
The tobacco producers .often complained about these measures to government
authorities. At times, the Ottoman government found the Regie justified in its actions
and acknowledged that, despite its harshness, the Regie was acting in line with
regulations. Sometimes, however, the government found the Regie's measures
unjustifiably harsh and unfair and protested them. For instance, the inspections of the
Regie guards (kolcus) often took excessively abusive tones. There are reported cases of
guards publicly searching and beating women suspected of possessing tobacco under
their skirts.229 At times, the kolcus even entered the household of tobacco growers
unlawfully and searched for unregistered tobacco while at the same time abusing
women and girls.230 The Ottoman government rebuked such offensive and unlawful,
acts, but the Regie's powers remained largely unchecked.
The cumbersome and sometimes vexatious regulations and policies of the Regie,
farmers did not discourage farmers from tobacco cultivation. The unprecedented boom
in tobacco prices encouraged many to remain in tobacco production and attracted others
to the sector, regardless of the inconvenience caused by the Regie. Many tobacco
producing small farmers benefited considerably from their engagement in the trade. The

positive income effect o f tobacco cultivation appears to have spread relatively evenly
throughout the countryside, as the American bid raised the purchasing prices upward
from the early 1900s onwards. There are reported cases of petty tobacco growers
improving their old houses and farm buildings, building.walls around their fields, and
buying new animals in this period.231 Clearly, these basic investments could not have
been carried out in an adverse conjuncture and under poor distributional arrangements.
Overall, the story o f regional tobacco production emerges as a broad, multi
layered process of tension and constant struggle between the foreign trading houses, the
Regie and the local tobacco producers. The competition between the trading houses
specialising in export trade and the Regie appear to have worked in favour of local
tobacco producers, particularly after the robust entry of American trading companies
into regional tobacco markets around the turn of the century. As we shall see in the
following chapters, the rapid growth of tobacco cultivation had far reaching
consequences. For instance, the dynamism in tobacco cultivation can be directly
associated with the growth of urban processing industries and broader processes of
urban growth in the region. Thus, the American and European trading houses, as well as
the Regie, emerged as strong “growth poles” capable of generating processes of
propulsive growth in other sectors o f the regional economy as well. Yet, more sterile, or
contained, processes of growth also emerged under favourable market conditions
without much propulsive impact on other sectors o f the regional economy. Opium
production, which had no immediate forward linkages within the regional economy,
appears to be a case in point.
3.3. Opium Production: The Dynamism of the Overseas M arkets
Poppy cultivation was virtually unknown in Selanik prior to the 1860s. A
“Turkish” farmer from the district o f I§tib in neighbouring Kosova introduced the crop
into the region for the first time in 1865. This anonymous farmer bought a handful of
poppy seeds on a visit to Karahisar in central Anatolia and cultivated them on his farm
back in I§tib. Encouraged by the success of his experiment, he extended the cultivation
231 Asir, 3.Za.l320 (2.2.1903), N.754: 1.
125


of the crop to a much larger scale in the following year and again achieved prime results
in both quality and quantity.232
The success of this pioneering initiative seems to have set an example in the
district and encouraged other farmers to take up poppy cultivation. Soon, poppy
cultivation had spread throughout the province of Kosova and from there expanded
rapidly into the province of Selanik. By the 1880s, the northern districts o f Istrumca and
Tikve§ had become important centres of poppy cultivation.233 Thus, within a matter of
two decades, regional opium production had increased from virtually nil to 62 tons in
1880.234
Behind this expansionary process lay mainly the buoyancy of overseas demand
for the high quality opium produced in the region. The expansion of pharmaceutical
industries in Europe and the United States, the rising military and medical demand for
opiates, and the (forced) “liberalisation” o f the opium trade in Asia, especially in China,
increased the world demand for opium from the 1870s onwards.235 The exceptionally
high quality opium produced in the region thus found much acclaim amongst European
and American merchants.236 More often than not, foreign and Ottoman merchants
purchased the opium harvest almost entirely. The bulk of the local produce was shipped
by British merchants and sent to China for immediate consumption. The remaining
produce was sent to the United States, Germany and France to be used in
pharmaceutical industries..In addition, some opium was sent regularly to Istanbul to be
used in hospitals, army headquarters and coffeehouses.
In response to growing demand for opium, world opium production increased
considerably over the last few decades, which led to a notable reduction in world opium
232 P.P.A..P., 1883, N. 6: 101. 233 1307 S.V.S., 1890, 53. 234 See Table 1.9.

23 6 The rich soils o f the I§tiblTikve§ basin and the arid climate o f the region in general, created an environment that was particularly well suited to the cultivation o f poppies. The poppy yields were usually high in quality and contained high dose of morphine extract, which could go up to 12% to 13% of the weight o f the opium produce. At the time, only the prime quality opium produced in Malatya and Karahisar region in central Anatolia could yield such high levels o f morphine. In fact, the opium produced in Kosova and Selanik was superior to many other varieties produced throughout the Empire. For instance, the much favoured Izmir produce was quite inferior and scarcely contained 9% morphine extract in total (P.P.A.P., 1883, C. N. 6: 101; F.O.A.S., 1887, N. 75: 3).
126


prices.237 Opium prices in Salonica followed the global trend. Between the early 1880s
and the late 1890s for instance, opium prices in Salonica declined by 18.1% (See Table
2.3).238 This was a considerable decline. However, when we consider the balance of
changing relative prices in the region, it is possible to argue that opium possibly
constituted the most lucrative cash crop produced in the region during this generally
deflationary period (See Table 2.2). In fact, many farmers who took up poppy
cultivation in this period were responding to strong market signals and remunerative
prices. In 1890, British Consul General Blunt reported that the local farmers were
increasing their sowings of poppy in response to the high prices offered by American
and British merchants.239 In 1895, Blunt argued that “.. .the cultivation of the poppy has
largely increased in Macedonia, and as, moreover, the Salonica and Constantinople
varieties are most in demand in foreign countries, it may be confidently expected that
the annual harvest here will before long begin to rival that of Asia Minor”.240
Accordingly, both exports and production of opium grew rapidly during the period.
Output increased from 61.7 tons in 1880 to 201.1 tons in 1902, while exports grew
proportionately from probably around 55-60 tons to over 200 tons during the same
period.241 The overwhelming weight of exports in total production leave little doubt
about the propulsive impact of strong overseas demand on regional opium production.

238 The opium prices seem to have declined proportionately throughout the empire. During the same period, opium prices declined in Istanbul as well. In the late 1890s for instance, the Geyve and Nallihan produce fetched 17% and 18.3% less compared to the early 1880 price levels. The inferior Malatya produce was marketed for 39% below its early 1880s levels (Quataert, Ottoman Reform, 300). 239 F.O.A.S., 1891, N. 822: 3; F.O.A.S., 1891, N. 962: 4. 240 F.O.A.S., 1896, N. 1663:7. 241 See Table 1.9.
127


Two additional factors seem to have underlined the rapid expansion of poppy
cultivation in the region. The Ottoman government provided considerable support for
poppy producers and actively encouraged the production of the crop. The government
granted attractive tax exemptions for farmers who took up poppy cultivation for the first
time. Local authorities also provided logistic and technical support to interested farmers.
Agricultural inspectors were sent to the districts to inform farmers on the exigencies of
poppy cultivation and opium production. These measures must have encouraged the
expansion o f tobacco cultivation throughout the region.242
The compactness of opium and the relatively low costs of transportation
associated with the product probably constituted another incentive that encouraged
poppy cultivation. Indeed, many cereal producers of the interior districts turned
increasingly towards poppy cultivation so as to avoid the prohibitive railway tariffs that.
had held them back from marketing their bulky cereal produce in Salonica.243 Under the
circumstances, poppy cultivation continued to expand especially in the interior
mountainous districts o f the region during the late 1890s and the 1900s.244
Both the production and exports of opium fell considerably in the post-1905
period. Output declined swiftly to 77 tons and exports contracted to 75 tons in total by
1908.245 This contraction was due mainly to a streak of bad harvests that hit the region
during the mid-late 1900s. Crops failed disastrously in 1905, 1907, 1908 and 1909.246
However, buoyant British and American demand for local opium remained firmly in
place. The ensuing supply deficiencies gave way to a substantial rise in opium prices
(see Table 2.3). This price increase occurred despite a notable deterioration in the
quality o f the opium produced in the aftermath of harvest failures; on occasions, the
morphine content was reported to have fallen to 11.0%. Still, the local produce,
competed well with other opium varieties produced in the Levant.247 Indeed, later in
242 For details o f the government’s support to local opium producers see Chapter 3. 243 D.T.O.G., 16.R.1313 (5.10.1895), N. 562: 472.

242 For instance, inferior opium varieties produced in the ‘Izmir’ region were often marketed as the produce of ‘Selanik’ in Istanbul markets, much to the annoyance o f local merchants (Asir, 18.N.1323 (16.11.1905), N. 1027: 2; Asir, 9.Ra.l324 (3.5.1906), N. 1073:2).
128


1912, agreeable weather conditions enabled output levels to rise to more than 100
tons.248
Despite the setback caused by harvest failures, opium retained its commercial
significance, and accounted for about 9.0% of the total value of exports from the port of
Salonica in the late 1900s, generating an average value of over £100,000 per annum.249
At the time only tobacco could generate comparable export earnings. Thus, through half
a century o f sustained expansion and growth, opium became one o f the leading
commercial crops of the region. More importantly, Selanik became one of the leading
centres o f poppy culture in the Levant, fulfilling the expectations of Consul Blunt in
1895. Behind this expansionary process lay favourable market trends, the high quality
of the produce, buoyant, almost inelastic overseas demand, low costs o f transportation
and the active encouragement of the Ottoman government. In this respect, opium
appears as the antithesis of cereal production, which suffered from the (absence of)
same factors that underlined the growth of opium production during the period under
consideration.
Conclusion
Demand side factors and institutional processes largely underlay the emergence
of a dual agrarian structure in the region during the late nineteenth and early twentieth
centuries. Favourable demand conditions were largely responsible for the rapid growth
and success of silk cocoon, opium and especially tobacco production in the Selanik
region. In contrast, cotton and cereal production suffered from tight competition in the
overseas and, especially after the turn o f the century, in the largely under-protected
domestic market. Under these circumstances, both sub-sectors performed poorly and
remained largely retarded until 1912.
The success o f tobacco production and sericulture in the region owed much also
to the regulatory framework and the institutional support provided by the PDA and the
248 Palairet, The Balkan Economies, 344. This figure seems to be an overestimate. According to a British consular report, the 1912 opium yield was 1600 cases (F.O.A.S., 1912, N. 5234: 9). At the time an opium case weighed 141 lbs. (F.O.A.S., 1911, N. 4797: 10), which brings the 1912 harvest to slightly over 100 tons.

foreign trading houses. The'PDA actively encouraged and supported the farmers willing
to take up sericulture in the region and thus contributed in important ways to the
recovery and growth o f silk cocoon production in Selanik. The case of tobacco followed
a similar but relatively more troubled path compared to that of silk cocoon production.
The tobacco Regie initially had a retarding effect on tobacco production. The Regie’s
efforts to bring the production, taxation and marketing of this lucrative crop under its
control initially scared some farmers away from tobacco production and drew smaller
merchants out o f business. However, once the Regie established its control, it provided
considerable financial support to local farmers and actively encouraged the development
of tobacco production in the region. The Regie also tightly controlled and regulated the
production and marketing of tobacco and thus set the rules o f the game in the tobacco
business. More importantly perhaps, the Regie effectively enforced these rules and
managed to bring some degree o f order and regularity into the production and marketing
processes. The strict, if draconian, presence of the Regie in regional tobacco markets left
little room for such fraudulent practices as debasement, which, as we have seen, created
serious problems for cotton and cereal exporters during the same period. In this regard,
through its regulatory powers and active support, the Regie contributed to the
development o f tobacco production in the region.
However, the strict pricing and taxation policies of the Regie withheld the
positive income effects o f tobacco production from reaching the lower strata of the
agrarian society at large. The Regie and the Austrian tobacco monopoly, Hertzog
Company, set prices at low levels that best served their financial interests often at the
expense o f the producers. The local landlords participated in this process and used their
influence to set the local prices at considerably low rates in return for handsome
commissions and remunerative prices for their own produce. Nevertheless, this apparent
“market-failure” did not hinder the development of the sector due to the robustness of
both the home and overseas demand during this period. The entry o f Americans into
local tobacco markets seriously challenged the Regie’s and Hertzog Company’s
oligopolistic grip over regional tobacco markets and turned the situation somewhat in
favour o f tobacco producers. The Americans entered local markets in an aggressive
manner and made massive purchases at high prices, often at the expense of the Regie.
Attracted by the remunerative prices offered by the American companies, many farmers
turned to tobacco cultivation and consequently regional tobacco production and exports
grew rapidly during the 1900s and brought handsome returns to all parties involved in
130


tobacco trade. Thus, within the context of a more competitive market formation and a
solid institutional framework that regulated and enforced the rules of the game, tobacco
production rose to unprecedented levels in Selanik.
The case o f tobacco sets the counterfactual against which we can consider both
cereal and cotton production. Both of the latter sub-sectors suffered from the lack of
regulatory bodies that could oversee the production and marketing of crops and enforce
the rules of the game without leaving much room for deceitful trading practices. The
debasement of cereal crops that surfaced in the process of unregulated market
transactions emerged as a serious problem that undermined cereal and cotton exports
from the region. The sluggish export performance, in turn, largely circumscribed the
growth potential o f cotton and cereal production. Cereal production also suffered from
prohibitive transaction costs that held grain marketing at bay. This situation undermined
the export potential of regional cereal production and circumscribed its capacity to serve
the rapidly growing urban markets. Yet, transportation costs, together with the charges
and tariffs levied at the port o f Salonica, provided local cereal producers with some
degree o f protection and allowed them to benefit from growing domestic urban demand
during the 1890s. However, the gradual reduction in railway tariffs and port charges
later in the 1900s reduced this slight margin of protection and exposed local markets to
intense foreign competition. Subsequently, the sector contracted further, and, by the end
of the period, the region became a net importer of cereals.
It is interesting to note that opium production, too, sets the counterfactual to
cereal production in this respect. Opium trade was largely unregulated. However, opium
cultivators benefited from high quality opium produced in the region, and also enjoyed
lower transportation costs. Thus, opium production grew rapidly, often at the expense of
cereal and cotton production, until the early 1900s. After this date, however, severe crop
failures disrupted opium production and the sub-sector remained largely retarded until
the end of the period.
Overall, in this chapter, we have seen the ways in which demand side factors and
institutional processes conditioned the emergence of a dual agrarian structure in the
region. Certain demand conditions and institutional processes simply favoured the
production of certain crops whiles others remained largely ‘excluded’ during the period
under consideration. Here the sub-sectors that could articulate with overseas markets
131


and were directly affiliated with European financial and commercial interests grew by
leaps and bounds. Other sub-sectors, such as cotton and cereal production, suffered
from unfavourable demand conditions and struggled to keep up with intensifying
foreign competition in a frustrating institutional void. The financial weakness and the
organisational inaptitude o f the Ottoman government were largely responsible for the
persistence o f the feeble institutional framework. In the following two chapters, we turn
our attention to government policy and consider the role played by the Ottoman state in
processes o f agrarian transformation discussed above.

CHAPTER III
DYNAMICS OF AGRARIAN TRANSFORMATION - 2:
AGRICULTURAL REFORM AND GOVERNMENT POLICY
Introduction
In the previous chapter, I argued that demand-side conditions and certain
institutional processes underlay the emergence of a dual agrarian structure in the region,
which was characterised by the coexistence of retarded and dynamic sub-sectors. I
suggested that adverse demand conditions set the broad conjunctural background to the
retardation of such important sub-sectors as cereal and cotton production. I also argued
that certain market failures and prohibitive transportation costs undermined the.
production o f these crops during the same period. In contrast, the dynamic sectors,
namely tobacco and silk cocoon production, benefited from favourable demand
conditions and/or adequate institutional support and systematic market regulation. For
instance, tobacco production benefited immensely from the buoyancy o f overseas
demand as well as the institutional support and the regulatory framework provided by
the tobacco Regie. Likewise, logistic and technical support provided by the PDA was
important for the rapid development of silk cocoon production from the late 1880s
onwards. Finally, opium production grew in response to robust overseas demand for the
high quality opium produced in the region.
These developments, however, did not take place in a political void. The
Ottoman government interfered with agrarian processes and tried to enhance the
strength and stability of the sector. In this chapter, we shall turn our attention to this
important issue and consider the role of the state in processes of agrarian change. This
effort is important for a number o f empirical and conceptual reasons.
Research on agricultural reform policies, concentrated mainly on the Anatolian
provinces and paid little attention to other parts of the empire.1 The current chapter

attempts to fill this persistent lacuna by concentrating on the impact o f government
policy on agriculture in the Selanik region during the period under consideration, using
original and virtually unused evidence gathered from European and Ottoman archives.
In this respect, the chapter constitutes a significant empirical contribution to Ottoman
economic history.
A thorough discussion of government policy is essential for the integrity and
comprehensiveness of our analysis of agrarian change in the Selanik region. So far, I .
have concentrated mainly on market processes and considered European capitalism as
an important dynamic that determined the broad pattern of agrarian transformation in
the region. However, endogenous factors also played an important role in this
transformation process and need to be taken into account. Focusing on state policy
allows us to consider the endogenous dynamics of agrarian change in the region.
First, let me clarify the conceptual parameters of my approach. It is important to
note that agricultural policy was not a sterile, unidirectional process that ran from the
“state” to the “civil society”. Quite the contrary, agricultural reform was a dynamic and
interactive process deeply influenced by the economic and political power struggles.
Government officers and bureaucrats strove to mediate and control this conflict-ridden
process and attempted to preserve and consolidate the political and economic interests
of the central government in due course. In this regard, I consider agricultural policy as
an integral part o f the central government’s quest for economic and political power,
rather than a straightforward drive for economic modernisation.
Political centralisation remained one of the primary concerns of the Ottoman
government during the Hamidian era.2 The central government attempted to consolidate
its political and administrative presence in the provinces during this period. Toward this
end, the government took certain administrative measures and invested in infrastructure
projects, on the one hand, and attempted to involve local notables (e§raf) more directly
in the political process, particularly in the Anatolian and Arab provinces, on the other.

As such, the government sought to deepen its authority and establish a diffused and
more indirect power base in the provinces. I argue below that agricultural policy
constituted an integral component o f the government’s efforts to expand its influence in
the provinces. Through a combination of political persuasion and financial support, the
authorities tried to involve the local notables into processes of agrarian reform and
hence into broader decision making processes. As such, they sought to maintain a solid
basis for governance in the provinces, especially in places where ethnic and political
tensions were particularly intense. As I shall demonstrate, Selanik was a case in point.
The government’s concern for agricultural reform was in line with its fiscal
concerns. Agriculture was the largest sector of the Ottoman economy and constituted
the primary source o f revenue for the Ottoman government. Ceteris paribus, a robust
agrarian economy meant that the government could improve its fiscal profile and use
the sources at its disposal to finance its costly military and administrative reform
projects.4 In this context, the government attempted to provide technical, logistic and
financial support to farmers, especially to small-scale peasant farmers who constituted
the backbone o f Ottoman agriculture, with a view to promoting growth and stability in
the sector. The Selanik region was no exception.
However, agricultural policy making was a complex process within which the
fiscal and political concerns o f the Ottoman government often proved irreconcilable.
The government officials apparently found themselves in an impasse whereby they
could not attain both policy objectives simultaneously. The fiscal feebleness and the
organisational inadequacies o f the provincial governments often forced officials to
compromise fiscal concerns in favour of political priorities. For instance, when the
government used the fiscal means at its disposal to secure the alliance and cooperation
of notables, it failed to provide sufficient support to actual cultivators due mainly to
insufficiency of public funds. Likewise, the authorities’ attempt to support the
cultivators in order to enhance agricultural production proved politically untenable in
the face o f the active and/or passive resistance of notables who jealously wanted to
maintain their grip over public resources. Under the circumstances, the authorities tried
to find a compromise between political priorities and fiscal concerns. It seems political

priorities reigned supreme and the officials ultimately used the organisational and fiscal
means at their disposal to secure the political cooperation o f notables.5
As it will be explained below, similar processes were at work in the Selanik
region.6 The authorities sought to consolidate the economic and political power-base of
the (Muslim) notables and thus attempted to prevent the dissolution of the political
status quo in the region. Consequently, the efforts to modernise agriculture remained
limited, yielding little success towards the end of the period. This policy line ultimately
failed as ethnic tensions eventually erupted into armed conflict in 1912. Nevertheless,
agricultural policy was consequential in the sense that the failure to provide adequate
financial and technical support to the actual farming communities consolidated the
market-induced processes of agrarian retardation in the region.
In what follows, I concentrate first on the government’s efforts to create an
agrarian bureaucracy that would carry out certain reform projects in the countryside and
provide technical and logistic assistance to farmers. Second, I discuss the government’s
efforts to provide financial support to fanners. In the final section, I focus on the actual
implementation of these policies and the practical aspects of the reform initiative. In this
context, I discuss the attempts to introduce new techniques of production into
agriculture and to encourage greater diversification in the sector. In this section, I also
discuss the impact o f ‘crisis management’ schemes instituted by the authorities. The
chapter ends with some concluding remarks on the impact o f government policy on
processes o f agrarian transformation in the Selanik region.
1. The Creation of an Agrarian Bureaucracy and the Selanik Agricultural School
The establishment o f an agrarian bureaucracy constituted an important
component o f agrarian reform policies pursued by the Ottoman government during the
Hamidian era. The authorities concentrated their efforts on two issues in the process of
bureaucratic reorganisation. First, they focused on the administrative reorganisation of
the agrarian bureaucracy at both the ministerial and provincial levels. Second, they
worked on the creation o f a cadre o f agricultural experts who would help introduce and

dissipate new techniques of production throughout the countryside. Both tasks posed
serious difficulties for the Hamidian authorities, which faced grave fiscal,
administrative and political problems that circumscribed their capacity to set up and
maintain a working and effective bureaucratic apparatus. Nevertheless, as it has been
amply demonstrated by Quataert, the authorities took important steps in this direction
and managed to implement agricultural reform policies that yielded significant results,
particularly in the Anatolian provinces o f the empire.
In what follows, first I briefly discuss the broad processes in bureaucratic
reorganisation within central and provincial governments and then move on to consider
effects o f these developments in the province of Selanik. In this context, I discuss the
organisation o f an agrarian bureaucracy in Selanik and assess the activities of the
agricultural schools set up,in the region. I point out the organisational strengths and
weaknesses of the provincial agrarian bureaucracy and argue that certain weaknesses
superimposed by fiscal insolvency and administrative inadequacies seriously impaired
the capacity o f the provincial government to carry out extensive reforms in the
countryside until the late-1890s. Afterwards, however, the provincial bureaucracy
dealing with agricultural matters became more effective, thanks mainly to the efforts of
agricultural inspectors appointed to the districts. Despite these developments, the
administrative capacity and the organisational reach of the agrarian bureaucracy still
fell short of the needs o f an extensive region that faced a multitude of agricultural
problems ranging from grasshopper attacks to the adverse effects o f the persistent
depression in cereal markets. In this context, the difficulty of attracting the graduates of
agricultural schools to poorly paid government posts hampered the reform efforts.
1.1. Bureaucratic Organisation: Prospects and Limitations
The early foundations o f an agrarian bureaucracy in the Ottoman Empire date
back to the Tanzimat period. Various councils and commissions dealing with
agricultural matters were established within the Foreign Ministry, the Finance Ministry,
and the Ministry o f Commerce at different points in time during the early years of the
Tanzimat era. The most important o f these councils were the Council of Agriculture
(Ziraat Meclisi) and the Council of Public Works (.Nafla Meclisi) established in the
Q
1840s and the 1850s, respectively. These councils primarily served as advisers to the
central government and prepared regular reports on the condition and problems of
agriculture in the provinces and made proposals to overcome these difficulties.
7 See Quataert, Ottoman Reform, 64-154. 8 Quataert, Ottoman Reform, 64-91; T. Giiran, 19.Yiizyil Osmanli Tarimi, 45-63; A. Akyildiz, Osmanli Merkez Te§kilatinda Reform [Reform in Ottoman Central Administration] (Istanbul: Eren Yayinlari, 1993), 127-140.
137


Apparently, the councils played an important role in shaping the direction of
agricultural policy. For instance, the appointment of agricultural directors (ziraat
mudurleri) to the provinces was, first suggested by the Council o f Agriculture.
Subsequently, the central government approved the proposal and appointed officials to
the provinces.9
The creation o f a separate budget for public works in the late 1840s, the
foundation of a department overseeing agriculture and public works within the Council
of State (§ura-i Devlet) in 1868, and, the establishment of an independent Ministry of
Commerce and Agriculture (Ticaret ve Ziraat Nezareti) in the same year were
important developments that laid the foundations of an agrarian bureaucracy during the
Tanzimat period. The establishment of the first agricultural school near Istanbul in 1847
was another important step in this respect.10
Despite these initial developments, however, the Ottoman agrarian bureaucracy
remained in its relative infancy until the end of the Tanzimat period. The
implementation o f agricultural reform policies formulated by the above mentioned
councils, remained largely confined to a number of pilot projects in designated locations
and a few logistic and legislative measures intended to encourage the growth of
commercial agriculture in the empire. The pilot projects involved providing credit,
seeds and plants to local farmers in a number of sub-provinces in Anatolia. The
measures taken to encourage the growth of commercial agriculture were mainly
legislative acts, which included exemptions from various tithes, abolishing trade
monopolies and other restrictions against the marketing of agricultural products, and
customs duty exemptions for imported agricultural machines and quality seeds. Yet,
government efforts remained limited during this period and the apparent growth of
agricultural production was primarily instigated by the initiative of the provincial
farming and mercantile communities.11
With the advent o f the Hamidian era important steps were taken to set up an
agrarian bureaucracy both in the centre and the provinces. The most important
developments at the centre were the foundation of a Scientific Committee for
Agriculture (Ziraat Heyet-i Fenniyesi) in 1892, and the establishment o f the Ministry of
Forests, Mines and Agriculture (Orman, Maden ve Ziraat Nezareti) in 1893. The
Scientific Committee acted as the central government’s agent to direct agricultural
reform and assumed numerous responsibilities that ranged from determining the general
direction o f agricultural reform policy to supervising the newly established agricultural

138


schools and model farms. The establishment of a new independent ministry was also
important, as it helped create a separate bureaucratic entity that dealt exclusively with
agricultural matters as distinct from commerce and public works. As such, the agrarian
bureaucracy could determine its policy objectives and priorities and use the budgetary
sources at its disposal to set up and maintain a more centralised bureaucratic system in
the provinces.12
The establishment of better structured agrarian bureaucratic organisations at a
provincial level was another important development of the Hamidian era. From the
early 1880s onwards, the central government started appointing agricultural inspectors
17
to the provinces on a regular basis. These agricultural inspectors were responsible
mainly for the administration of the agricultural schools and model farms in their
respective provinces and often acted as the practical carriers of the reform programs. In
addition, the agricultural inspectors participated actively in the implementation of the
‘crisis management’ policies o f the Ottoman government, and directed a wide range of
schemes to this effect, such as combat against diseases and the attack of hazardous
insects and seed distribution schemes designed to counterbalance the adverse effects of
crop failures. However, as Quataert rightly points out, the efforts o f the agricultural
inspectors fell short o f bringing about the desired effect in reform and modernisation.14
Another important development at the provincial level during the Hamidian era
was the establishment of semi-autonomous Chambers of Agriculture (Ziraat Odalari)
from the early 1880s onwards. The members o f these chambers were elected from
amongst the prominent provincial notables, agriculturalists and merchants. The duties
of the chambers included the preparation of regular reports on the condition of
agriculture and the factors impeding its development. However, the executive powers of
the chambers were quite limited. The chambers could do very little without the
authorisation and financial support of the local and central governments, except for
organising minor agricultural exhibitions and competitions to encourage agricultural
development. Thus, the chambers mainly served as transmitters of information between
the provinces and central government until they were officially abolished in the mid
1890s. After this date, many agricultural chambers merged with the local chambers of
commerce and continued to provide information and support to central as well as
provincial governments.15

139


The formation o f an agrarian bureaucracy in the province of Selanik followed
the broad pattern described above. The best sources that provide information on the
development of an agrarian bureaucracy in the region are the provincial yearbooks
{salnames) published by the government. The 1882 yearbook clearly shows the
weakness and indeed the virtual absence of a comprehensive bureaucratic apparatus
dealing with agrarian matters at the onset of the Hamidian era. The only government
department that could have dealt with agricultural matters during this early period was
the administration of forests {Orman Idaresi) situated in the provincial capital,
Salonica. The department included an inspector general, another inspector for the
districts o f Drama and Siroz, and three administrative assistants in all.16
Selanik’s bureaucracy grew steadily throughout the 1890s. By the late 1900s,
there was at least one agricultural inspector in each kaza. Besides, there was also one
17
chamber o f commerce and'agriculture m almost every district. Both the agricultural
inspectors and the chambers o f commerce and agriculture worked actively to encourage
modernisation and to combat natural disasters in their respective districts. Although the
efforts yielded some success in combating the adverse effects of natural calamities, the
energetic venture o f a handful o f agricultural inspectors fell short of providing
1ft
sufficient technical and logistic support to farmers. Here the main problem seems to
have emanated from the priorities o f the local government. The provincial authorities
were apparently reluctant to allocate sufficient public funds towards extensive agrarian
reform. Instead, available fiscal resources were used primarily to consolidate the
organisational power and the bureaucratic reach of the other compartments of the
provincial bureaucracy, such as the departments of tax collection, justice and public
security.19 In other words, the local government seems to have pursued a more direct
approach to resolve its fiscal and political problems and prioritised reform in areas of
fiscal and administrative organisation. Agrarian reform came further down the list of
official priorities.
1.2. The Agricultural School of Salonica: Potential and Reality
The Hamidian authorities showed considerable attention to the education and
training o f agricultural experts. During the 1880s and the early 1890s, numerous bright
graduates o f the leading Ottoman schools, such as the Imperial Lycee (Mekteb-i Sultani)
and the Civil Service School {Mekteb-i Mulkiye), were sent to France, Belgium and
Germany on full government scholarship to study agricultural sciences. Upon

graduation, these students served as agricultural inspectors in the provinces and
eventually ascended to higher posts within the bureaucratic hierarchy. The government
70
also appointed these experts to teaching positions in agricultural schools.
Three major agricultural schools were established in Istanbul, Salonica, and
Bursa during the Hamidian era. The schools successfully educated and trained hundreds
of agricultural experts. The graduates o f the prestigious Halkah Agricultural School in
Istanbul entered the bureaucratic hierarchy on quite advantageous terms and rose
rapidly in the ranks to reach positions of power with relative ease and speed. The
graduates o f the schools in Salonica and Bursa often had to settle for with lesser
bureaucratic positions in the provinces.21
The agricultural schools contributed significantly to the creation of a cadre of
educated agrarian bureaucrats. However, it is important to note that the participation of
these agriculturalists into the actual reform process remained limited. Only a small
portion o f the graduates became agricultural inspectors and worked in close contact
with farming communities. The majority of the graduates either became desk-bound
bureaucrats in administrative positions or pursued careers elsewhere in the private
sector.
The Agricultural School of Salonica {Selanik Hamidiye Ziraat Ameliyat
Mektebi) opened in early October 1889 with a glittering ceremony, which was attended
by the governor general of Selanik, high ranking bureaucrats and officers and
77
prominent local notables. The school was located about seven kilometres west of
Salonica. The school complex included numerous school buildings, student dormitories,
spacious gardens, and a model farm of about 150 hectares. Altogether, the entire
complex cost the local government more than O.L. 5,000, significantly overshooting the
estimated budget o f O.L. 4,000.23
The school policy for student selection had a distinctly ‘populist’ overtone. The
basic requirements for admission were straightforward and emphasised Ottoman
citizenship, fitness, youth and prior academic excellence.24 The populist emphasis was
evident in the sensitivity of the school administration towards the class status and

religious background o f the students. The entrants were to be from farming families
(giftgi) and no priority was given to any particular religious community in admission.
Apparently, these two principles were emphasised to secure the incorporation of the
school graduates in the actual process of reform and innovation in rural areas. In
favouring the giftgi sons for instance, the authorities sought to create a cadre of well
trained experts who had deep rooted family interests in farming and were therefore
more likely, at least in principle, to be engaged in agricultural pursuits upon graduation.
Similarly, by maintaining a careful balance between the Muslim and the non-Muslim
entrants, the administrators-were hoping to reach all farming communities, irrespective
of their cultural, linguistic and religious backgrounds.25 Thus, new techniques and
know-how would be better disseminated at the grassroots level and reach a wider range
of cultivators through the active agency o f school graduates.
The school was run like a military academy. The students were kept under close
supervision and were subject to strict disciplinary measures. All students were to board
at the school quarters throughout the academic year and all their expenses, including a
monthly allowance o f 10 kuru$&s, were to be met by the government. The average day
o f the students was strictly structured. Education was intense and captured much of the
day. Each day the students attended five and a half hours o f classroom teaching and
three and a half hours o f practical training in the field. Between the classes and the
training sessions they were given a total of three hours of rest and breaks. They had an
additional five hours for other needs and duties, such as cleaning, prayers, physical
exercise and homework. The remaining eight hours were reserved for sleeping.
The three-year course syllabus was based on the program of the French
agricultural schools.27 In the first year, the students took basic courses in religious
education, Turkish, French, calculus, geography, public administration and drawing. In
the second year, they followed more advanced courses on the same topics and in
addition took general courses on agricultural science, chemistry, metallurgy, botany and
animal husbandry. In their final year, they focused on specialised topics such as the
construction and design o f agricultural buildings, agricultural industry and technology,
agricultural chemistry, techniques of combat against hazardous insects and animals,
sericulture, horticulture, viticulture and general accounting. In the same year, they also
completed their core courses on Turkish and French. Throughout, the students went

through applied training in the model farm and became familiar with the most up-to
date techniques and tools of production.29 Thus, they found ample opportunity to
understand the practical exigencies o f their trade on the field.
Until the turn o f the century, two main groups o f teachers were employed side
by side at the school. The first group included agricultural experts, who were probably
educated abroad and/or had served for many years as agricultural inspectors and gained
considerable experience in the field. This group included the energetic agricultural
inspector of Selanik, Vitalis Efendi - the first headmaster of the school - and his
colleagues Avadisyan, Kalfayan, Onnik and Ali Osman Efendis. These experts
delivered lectures strictly on technical topics, such as agricultural science, sericulture,
animal husbandry, viticulture, horticulture, chemistry and geology.30 A second group of
predominantly Muslim teachers, possibly graduates of the Darulfunun (Faculty of
Sciences) or the Dariilmuallimin (Faculty of Education) in Istanbul, such as Suad Bey
(the second headmaster o f the school), Fazli Necib, Mahmud, Arif and Ali Haydar
Efendis, gave general courses on geography, history, calculus, Turkish, French and
public administration.31
This academic staff, which combined expert agriculturalists and professional
teachers, ran the entire program successfully until 1904. From 1889-1904, about ten to
fifteen students graduated from the school each year, adding up to a potential sum of
about 200 young and well trained agriculturists. After 1904, the staff of the school was
39
replaced by a new group of exclusively Muslim teachers. The new teaching staff was
possibly the product of the Halkali Agricultural School in Istanbul. These teachers
carried the program o f the school successfully until 1912. Throughout, the quality of
education at the school remained one of the highest by Ottoman standards.
The quality of education and the strict quasi-military atmosphere of the school
ensured that its graduates.would be disciplined, well-mannered, literate, numerate,
multi-lingual and faithful individuals who were also equipped with the specialised
knowledge o f modem agricultural techniques. These ‘giftgi youngsters made into
technicians’ were to be the harbingers of modernisation in the Ottoman countryside
and, the closest Ottoman term that would signify a gentlemen, i.e. an efendi, was
bestowed upon them after their graduation. Ironically, the efendi graduates of the school

were perhaps too well educated and refined for the task they were intended for at the
first place. Apparently, many graduates showed little interest in going back to the
countryside and sharing their acquired expertise with their fellow countrymen for a
number o f cultural and economic reasons.
After three years o f exposure to intensive education, urban lifestyle and culture,
many students grew more ambitious and pursued a career elsewhere, particularly in
administrative hierarchy. The best graduates of the school often moved into higher
education. They enrolled at the Halkali Agricultural School in Istanbul and eventually
joined the ranks of high calibre Ottoman bureaucrats employed in ministries and other
leading public institutions. Some o f the less successful graduates joined the ranks of
local government officials and started their careers as bureaucrats in administrative
offices in a sub-provincial centre. These positions, however, were relatively limited in
number and mostly at low administrative levels with little prestige and prospect.
Besides, low pay in government service and the irregularity with which the government
officers received their salaries was also an important factor that discouraged graduates
from pursuing their careers in the public sector. Under the circumstances, most
graduates o f the school pursued careers in the private sector and became clerks,
accountants, translators and administrators, or started their own petty businesses in
commerce, services and even manufacturing. Thus, they continued to enjoy urban
lifestyles and the prestige that came with their educational background and status.34
The authorities soon realised that it would not be possible to attract the
graduates of the Agricultural School into public service without good and regular pay
and prospects o f promotion within the bureaucratic system. Given the limited fiscal
sources at their disposal, the authorities considered (alternative) ways of enticing the
graduates into public service at the grassroots level. On one occasion, for instance, the
authorities entertained the idea of employing the graduates as ‘inspectors of agriculture
and technical matters’ (ziraat ve fen mudiiru) in each district (kaza). The cost of these
appointments was to be met by a new animal surtax of one or two kuru§QS for each
Targe headed animal’ in every district. In another case, the authorities thought of
offering the graduates teaching positions in the elementary schools in villages and small
towns, where they could get into direct contact with farming communities and share
their expertise with the farmers on the field. The graduates appointed to the schools

Findley, Ottoman Civil Officialdom: A Social History, (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1989) and Kalemiyeden Mulkiyeye, Osmanli Memurlarmm Toplumsal Tarihi, [From Scriber to the Bureaucrat, The Social History o f the Ottoman Civil Servants], (Istanbul: Tarih Vakfi Yurt Yaymlan, 1996), for a detailed discussion o f the living standards of Ottoman civil servants during the Hamidian era. 34 SeeAsir, 10.§.1323 (9.10.1905), N. 1016: 2;Asir, 28.B.1324 (17.8.1906), N. 1112: 2. 35 BA, TFR.l.A., 16/1597, 12.11.1319 (25.1.1904).

were to be paid a monthly salary o f 300 kuru§Qs.36 In addition, they were to be kept
exempt from military service.37
It seems that such proposals either never really materialised or failed to achieve
the desired effect. For instance, there is no evidence to suggest that the above.
mentioned public fund was ever created. Likewise, the plan to attract agricultural
experts to teaching posts in villages and small towns does not appear to have
materialised in significant numbers.38 A reform proposal presented to the Sublime Port
in 1907 indicates that the local authorities were still complaining about the
insufficiency o f properly trained specialists in agricultural bureaus and other related
*7Q
government offices in the districts. The establishment o f a new agricultural school in
Siroz in the early 1910s apparently did not change the situation significantly, and the
problem o f recruiting agricultural experts in government offices persisted until the end
of the period.40 The inadequacy o f expert staff largely undermined the government’s
ability to provide technical and logistical assistance to farmers. This problem, as we
shall see, became particularly apparent in the attempts to diffuse up-to-date
technologies and other modem techniques of production in the countryside. It is
important to note, however, that the authorities, nevertheless, did their best to promote
agricultural ‘development’ and worked hard to provide technical and logistic assistance
to farmers. They devoted considerable energy, time and resources to encourage greater .
diversification, growth and stability in the sector. These efforts, despite the limitations
discussed above, yielded important results that will be discussed below. The credit
policy o f the Ottoman government constituted the pillar o f agricultural reform in the
empire.
2. Public Credit Policy and the Agricultural Bank
2.1. General Developments
One o f the most tenacious problems of the nineteenth-century Ottoman
economy was underinvestment. Capital investment concentrated mainly in the
construction sector and was primarily used to finance costly infrastructure projects,
36Asir, 28.B.1324 (17.8.1906), N. 1112: 2. 37Asir, 10.§.1323 (9.10.1905), N. 1016:2. 38 A report published in 1912 mentions the appointment o f a school graduate o f the agricultural school to an elementary school in one o f the villages in the district of Drama (T.Z.N.M., 30.11.1328 (13.5.1912), N. 18: 261). However, I have not been able to find trace o f similar appointments in contemporary sources. Indeed, complaints concerning the inadequacy of agricultural experts appear regularly in reports. See below. 39 TFR.l.UM., 25-A/2493, 15.6.1326 (28.8.1910). 40 T.Z.N.M., 30.11.1328 (13.5.1912), N. 18: 264-265.
145


such as the construction of railways, roads, harbours, etc.41 Investment levels remained
considerably low in crucial sectors o f the economy. In manufacturing, for instance,
overall investment levels evidently remained insufficient, despite the establishment of a
number of factories in basic consumer industries and the apparent dynamism in certain
compartments o f artisanal and rural manufacturing industries 42 Underinvestment was
notable also in agriculture. In general, conventional techniques o f production persisted
in the sector. These techniques yielded modest results in productivity and only a
tentative bulwark against natural hazards that regularly disrupted agricultural
production. The gains on the technology front remained confined to regions with a high
degree o f commercialisation and materialised only towards the very end of the
Hamidian era. Otherwise, expansion agricultural lands was normally the main avenue to
agricultural growth and the sector remained at a Schumpeterian standstill in general43
Other problems and impediments that underscored the Schumpeterian standstill
included the scarcity o f capital, or rather its ‘unavailability’ for investment. The dearth
of capital was associated with a number o f complex structural and conjunctural factors,
some o f which were typical of all peripheral economies in nineteenth century, and
others were more peculiar to the Ottoman economy. Briefly, strong rent-seeking
motives, tightening European financial control, the liberal trade regime of the empire,
and intensifying international competition were all important factors that accentuated
underinvestment in key sectors o f the economy during the nineteenth century, in
general, and throughout the Hamidian era, in particular.44
From the very early days of the Tanzimat era onwards, the government
authorities sought ways to overcome the problem of underinvestment in the economy.

Their efforts concentrated primarily on agriculture. They set up a number of public
credit institutions that would provide financial assistance to farmers and agricultural
reform projects.
The most important public credit institutions that were set up during the
Tanzimat era were the ‘district funds’ {memleket sandiklari).45 The sandiks were first
established in the European provinces o f the empire in the early 1860s and spread
rapidly in other provinces thereafter. The sandiks were mainly cooperatives that
extended credit exclusively to their members. They were administered by locally
elected members who often came from the higher echelons of the social hierarchy, that
is to say they were a notable landlord or a prominent merchant and the like. The capital
was provided by the sanddCs participating members, who granted a certain portion of
their produce to the cooperative each year. The interest rates on loans were kept at 12%
per annum. Credit was granted to the members either on the basis of real estate
collaterals or on personal guarantees acquired from third parties. The net annual profit
o f the sandik was to be used for the construction of public works and schools within the
district.46
The sandiks provided the farming communities with a viable alternative to local moneylenders, who often lent money at exorbitant rates o f interest, which could reach
up to 40% per annum. Tlie terms o f payment, especially for short term credits, were
also quite unfavourable. These usurious practices often brought peasant proprietors
under acute economic distress, which, at times, gave way to full dispossession under a
growing cycle o f indebtedness 47 The sandiks could potentially play an important role in
securing small peasant proprietorship in agriculture. Providing cheap loans to farmers
could help consolidate their financial profile and help them get through difficult times
without having to lose their property and become dispossessed tenant farmers on the
land they once held in ownership. The sandiks were particularly important in
counterbalancing the dislocating effects of market processes and of natural calamities,
which often forced farmers into indebtedness that could lead to loss of property. The
stabilising potential of the sandiks becomes even more evident when we consider the
1858 Land Law and the subsequent legislation that liberalised the land regime of the
empire and rendered dispossession a more likely scenario for peasant proprietors in
economic distress.48
45 Here I would like to acknowledge Carter Findley’s suggestion for the translation o f memleket sandiklari as ‘district funds’ into English.

However, the sandiks suffered from a number of serious drawbacks. First, the
capital of the sandiks was often insufficient for the purposes they were set up for.
Secondly, the existing funds were mismanaged and ended up in the hands of notables
and other prominent men, rather than the actual cultivators genuinely in need of
financial support. Moreover, the debtors often did not pay back their dues to the
sandiks, whose financial profile was thus further undermined in the medium term.
Finally, the sandiks’ capital was often transferred to the coffers of the central and
provincial government at times o f acute fiscal crisis, leaving little or no capital for local
use. These drawbacks claimed much from the efficacy of the sandiks and their potential
could never be fulfilled.49
In the early 1880s, The sandiks were reformed and transferred into local ‘benefit
funds’ (menafi sandiklari). In comparison to the memleket sandiklari, the newly
established menafi sandiklari were somewhat better financed and put under closer
supervision of the central government. A surtax (menafi iane hissesi) of 1.0% was
added to the standard taxes with the specific purpose of financing the benefit funds.
This surtax constituted the primary source for the newly established funds, menafi
sandiklari, and aimed at securing a regular flow of capital into them. In addition, the
authorities introduced certain measures to check and control the sandik councils, which
were still administered by locally elected members. The sandik administrations were
asked to keep proper and regular accounts of their transactions and they were required
to report regularly to the Ministry o f Commerce and Public Works about their activities
on a quarterly basis. In addition, the authorities brought down the official rate of
interest to 9.0%, much to the benefit of the debtors.50
Despite these important developments, the menafi sandiklari suffered from the
same problems that had impaired the operation and effectiveness of their predecessors.
The local magnates continued to usurp available public funds. In addition, the benefit
funds encountered serious problems in the collection of interest and capital payments
and thus considerable financial difficulty. Unable to bring some degree o f order to the
finances and administration o f menafi sandiklari, the central government ultimately
suspended their operations and started preparations for the establishment of a more
structured public credit institution in the late 1880s.51

The Agricultural Bank (Ziraat Bankasi) was established in 1888. The bank was
much better financed and administered in comparison to anything that preceded it. The
bank was put under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Commerce and Public Works. A
central administrative committee (idare meclisi) comprised of appointed and salaried
bureaucrats oversaw the organisation, operation and general activities of the bank.
Branches were established in all provincial centres and in leading sub-provinces
(sancak) and districts (kaza). These branches were administered by a centrally
appointed director, a deputy director, and a committee made up o f local representatives.
The entire bank network was organised in the form of a well structured bureaucratic
hierarchy. Each bank branch in a lesser administrative unit was accountable to the bank
branches in higher administrative centres. The provincial branches were directly
accountable to the administrative committee in Istanbul.
The capital o f the bank came from a number of sources. First, all assets of the
menafi sandiklari were transferred to the Agricultural Bank. Secondly, a third of the
annual net profits of the bank was added every year to its capital. Finally, the above
mentioned surtax menafi iane hissessi provided the bank with an important source of
regular capital inflow.53
The credit policy of the bank was quite clear and, in principle, the bank
provided financial assistance to cultivators at low rates of interest and favourable terms
of payment. The rate of interest was set at 6.0%, and an additional 1.0% was charged
for administrative expenses. The payment of loans could be spread over a period of one
to ten years, depending on the nature of the credit arrangement. Farmers who were
directly engaged in agricultural production and who could prove their genuine need for
credit for agricultural purposes were eligible to apply for a loan. The official proof of
these qualifications was to be obtained from the local village council of elders (ihtiyar
meclisi). Credits were extended to cultivators against their mortgaged property and,
rarely, on the basis of collective guarantees. Each applicant had to prove his genuine
ownership o f the real estate that would be mortgaged and the relevant documentation
had to be approved by the local village council of elders. The bank assessed the value of
the real estate shown as collateral and decided on the final terms of the credit
arrangement. Failure to pay the outstanding debts ended in sequestrations. The bank
auctioned off the sequestered property to the highest bidder. The only exception to this
practice was failure to pay outstanding debts as a result of natural disasters, which could
seriously upset agricultural production and give way to acute financial distress in the
short and the medium terms. Finally, the ceiling for individual credits was scaled in

accordance with the capital worth of each bank branch. The credit ceiling was set at
5.000 kuru§ts for branches with capital worth less than one million kuru§QS. A .
maximum of 10,000 kuru§QS and 15,000 k,uru§QS were granted to the applicants in bank
branches with a capital worth ten and fifteen million kuru§QS, respectively.54
The annual profit of the Agricultural Bank was distributed among the branches,
provincial administrations and the Ministry of Commerce and Public Works. As I have
noted above, a third o f the profits was set aside as capital for the bank. Another third
was sent to the provincial governments to finance schemes that would promote
agricultural development and secure the stability of the sector in that province. Finally,
the remaining third of the annual bank profits was forwarded to Istanbul to finance the
agricultural reform projects undertaken directly by the central government. Thus, the
bank served as a public credit institution as well as the financier o f agrarian reforms.55
The Agricultural Bank, too, suffered from a series o f drawbacks, particularly in
the early years o f its formation. Credit application procedures often proved too complex
and cumbersome for ordinary farmers. The typically uneducated farmers often failed to .
understand the details o f bureaucratic procedures and filed incomplete or inadequate
applications. Faulty applications often led to the outright denial o f credit to needy
farmers.56 Thus, simple ignorance and unfamiliarity with new bureaucratic procedures
prevented the ordinary farmers from access to the public credit markets. Moreover, the
bureaucratic procedures were quite costly and could raise the effective rate of interest to
15.0%, or higher in the case o f short-term loans.57 Under the circumstances, many small
peasant farmers turned to the private credit markets where procedures were less
cumbersome and familiar practices normally defined the specific terms of the credit
arrangement between the moneylender and the debtor.
The attitude of bank administrators seems to have created additional problems.
Apparently, bank administrators examined the applications carefully and in general felt
reluctant to extend credits to small peasant farmers who had limited financial means at
their disposal. The bank administrators had good reason to act cautiously in assessing
risky applications. Delays in debt payments and defaults on outstanding debts w ere.

This suggests that the procedural fees could constitute an additional and up-front 8.4% on one-year loans. Thus, the official effective rate of interest could go up to 15% and even more (D.T.O.G., 4.Ra.l308 (18.10.1890), N. 303: 493).

common, and caused much trouble for the bank administrators. In addition, bogus
applications and other fraudulent practices often led the bank to lose money. For
instance, the exaggeration o f the value o f the real estate shown as collateral was a
common practice that cost bank branches dearly. Similarly, the difficulties encountered
in the sale o f sequestered property put bank administrators in trouble sometimes and
compelled them to assign the property back to the original owner at the bank’s expense.
These problems underlined the administrators’ caution in assessing credit applications
and possibly enticed them to extend credits to those who could afford to pay it back,
instead o f the small-scale peasant farmers. Under the circumstances, the available
public funds ended up in the hands of local notables, who could readily exert pressure
on bank administrators and obtain the available funds. The less fortunate segments of
the rural society, that is the small holders, sharecroppers and other agricultural workers,
were thus largely excluded from the public credit markets.58
This situation was further underscored by the requirement o f real estate as
collateral against outstanding debts. The dispossessed farmers, especially sharecroppers
and other agricultural workers employed on private estates (giftliks), could not apply for
bank credits. Also, many modest farmers in possession of small holdings remained reluctant to mortgage and risk their property, which constituted their primary source of
livelihood. Thus, many farmers preferred to deal with the local moneylenders, who,
unlike the Agricultural Bank, willingly accepted a share of the annual harvest as
collateral against outstanding debts. This practice did not put peasant holdings directly
at risk and constituted a strong incentive to deal with the local moneylenders, despite
the high rates of interest prevailing in private credit markets.59
Despite its shortcomings, the bank contributed to the development and stability
of agriculture in important'ways during the Hamidian era. First, notwithstanding the
above mentioned problems and limitations, some public credits found their way into the
hands o f peasant farmers. The standardisation and simplification of the application
procedures, the increasing familiarity of the farmers with bank practices, the
improvement o f bank services, and the increasing acceptance of collective guarantees
as collateral against bank loans, significantly improved farmers’ access to public credit
markets, particularly after the turn o f the century. Thus, the bank contributed
significantly to the development of the sector in leading centres of commercial
agriculture. As we shall see below, Selanik was not an exception.

Secondly, the Agricultural Bank funds played a crucial role in the
implementation o f the agricultural reforms and crisis management schemes initiated by
the central or the provincial governments. The most important initiatives of the
Ottoman government in this regard involved the establishment of agricultural schools
and model farms and the appointment of agricultural inspectors to the provinces. The
bank funds regularly transferred to the coffers o f the central and provincial
governments helped finance these projects. Also, the Agricultural Bank funded most
crisis management schemes, such as seed distribution programs and settlement projects.
2.2. Developments in Selanik
In Selanik, both large and small proprietors depended heavily on local usurers in
order to acquire short-term loans on the eve of the Hamidian era. Memleket sandiklari,
and later menafi sandiklari, remained largely dysfunctional or fell short o f meeting the
needs of local farming communities, due mainly to the above discussed organisational
drawbacks and the ill-administration of local funds.60 The British Consul to Salonica,
Richard Wilkinson, highlighted the customs prevailing in the private credit markets
during the early 1870s as follows:
No facilities whatever are afforded, either by the Government, or by special public companies. Loans are raised from private parties, commonly as usurious rates of interest, varying from 15 to 24 per cent. These loans are generally contracted for the purpose of replacing stock, or, in seasons of bad harvest, for purchasing seeds. Mortgages are seldom effected, but, when this occurs, the rate o f interest is the same as stated above. The following method is resorted to by large proprietors to obtain advances on their estates. A deed is drawn up before the Mehkeme, or Ecclesiastical Court, in which the proprietor acknowledges the amount borrowed and appoints die lender his attorney, empowering him at the same time, on the expiration of the term mentioned in the said deed, to sell his estate in case o f non-payment. The rate o f interest is from 15 to 24 per cent. Small proprietors borrow at the same rate of interest, but give either personal security, or pledge their crops.61
The establishment mf the Agricultural Bank altered the situation significantly in
Selanik as well and provided farming communities with a viable alternative to the local
usurers. The bank started its operations in 1889 with 22 branches that were located in
all districts o f the province.62 The branches were established with the modest capital
60 According to the S.V.S. 1299 (1882), there were only 10 benefit fund {menafi sandigi) branches in the province of Selanik. The sandik branches were located in the districts o f Selanik, Yenice, Avrethisan, Kesendire, Vodine, Toyran, Istrumca, Menlik, Zihne and Drama. 61 P.P.A.P., 1870, V. 27: 304.

stock accruing from the now abolished menafi sandiklari. The total capital stock of the
bank branches in the region did not exceed 10,000,000 kuru$es in 1889. Within a
decade, this amount had risen rapidly to reach 21,000,000 kuru$es in 1900. The capital
of the bank continued to increase during the 1900s and rose by more than 50% to reach
32,000,000 kuru$es in 1908.63
The bank branches pursued a liberal credit policy. According to official
statistics, between 1889 and 1908, the bank distributed loans worth an average of about
4.190.000 kuru§QS every year. This suggests that the bank had injected a total sum of
79.610.000 kuru§es worth o f capital into the agricultural sector solely through the
extension o f credits during the same period.64 This sum was quite significant by
contemporary standards. For example, one of the most important infrastructural
investments in the region, i.e. the new commercial harbour of Salonica and the new
quays, cost the Civil List and the contractor company a total of 30,000,000 kuru§Qs at
around the turn o f the century.65 The waterworks, trams and the gas and electricity
works o f Salonica cost another 22,000,000, 4,400,000 and 11,000,000 kuru§QS,
respectively, adding up to 37,400,000 kuru§QS in total.66 The significance of the amount
injected into the sector by the Agricultural Bank becomes even more evident if we
consider the real worth o f 4,190,000 kuru§es in terms o f farm tools and implements it
could buy at the time. At around the turn of the century, a standard, single bladed
American iron plough was sold for 150 kuru$es in Salonica, and a good quality
mechanised sieve o f French make cost , about 1,400' kuru$es. Therefore, crudely
speaking, the capital provided by the bank was theoretically sufficient to buy, in
nominal terms, about 27,900 iron ploughs, or 2,990 mechanised sieves every year on
IV7
average.
The credits extended by the bank were quite significant also in per capita terms,
and must have improved the financial profile of the farmers noticeably. The bank
extended an average o f over 4,000 loans every year between 1889 and 1908. The
average loan was about 1,100 kuru§Qs. According to Eldem*s tentative estimates, per
capita income level in the Selanik province was also about 1,100 kuru§es in 1907. If
this figure is accurate, than the average loan would have doubled the yearly income of
the average farmer. Alternatively, a standard farmer could have bought seven American

iron ploughs with this amount, or more than three-quarters of a good quality
mechanised sieve imported from France.69
These aggregate values and broad average figures point to only the potential
contribution of the bank to agricultural development, of course. The actual contribution
of the bank remains to be established according to the distribution o f credits and the
ways in which these loans were used.
One often comes across swift criticisms of the bank’s credit policy in
contemporary sources. For example, contributors to one o f the leading newspapers of
Salonica, Asir, time and again pointed to the importance o f extending credits to actual
giftgis (cultivators), rather than the estate owners whose use o f credits for productive
ends was by no means certain. Such diffuse credit policies, they argued, would ideally
ensure productivity gains in agriculture and help elevate the financial profile of the
peasant farmers under economic distress. Besides, providing credit to small scale
peasant farmers could enable them to respond to emerging market signals robustly and
to switch to the production of agricultural products favoured by the economic
conjuncture.70
On one occasion, for example, an anonymous, and suspiciously literate, farmer
from Yenice complained about the dominance o f landlords in public credit markets in a
letter to the Asir. He argued that this practice left little credit available to actual
cultivators. He alternatively demanded a more equitable distribution of credits and
suggested that the extension o f credits directly to the cultivators would be more
beneficial for the development o f the sector at large. Besides, the more equitable
distribution of available funds, he argued, would have important spill-over effects. It
would enable more farmers to use modem technology, and the widespread use of the
new technology would, in turn benefit a larger group o f cultivators, and thus help
overcome difficulties involved in the diffusion of new techniques throughout the
countryside.71
These contemporary accounts have a point and reflect the built-in biases of the
bank’s credit policy. Similar complaints concerning the distribution of credits surface in
archival sources as well. For instance, inquiries over favouritism in the distribution of
bank credits are common amongst the provincial governments’ correspondences with
69 For agricultural machine prices see O.M.Z.M., ll.Za.1317 (12.3.1900), V. 76, N. 1: 28-31. 70 See Asir, 21.B.1314 (26.12.1896), N. 137: 1; Asir, 6.§.1314 (10.1.1897), N. 141: 4; Asir, 12.B.1322 (22.9.1904), N. 915: 2 for such complaints. 71 Asir, 6.§.1314 (10.1.1897), N. 141: 4.

154


the centre.72 These examples of favouritism confirm the validity of the complaints
voiced in the Asir.
Available qualitative evidence supports the concerns raised in the contemporary
sources. The data presented in Appendix 5 suggest that the districts where giftliks were
prominent absorbed the bulk and an increasing share of the bank loans during the
period under consideration. More specifically, the districts of Selanik, Karaferye,
Vodine, Katrin, Avrethisar, Nevrekop, Gevgeli and Petri^ all locations where estates
were common, received about 25-30.0% of the bank loans during the late 1880s and the
early 1890s. By the turn o f the century, they received about 35-45.0% of the loans.
Their share increased even further after the turn of the century and reached slightly over
50.0% in 1908. Accordingly, the share o f the districts where small peasant
proprietorship was more prominent decreased steadily in the same period.
Overall, it seems reasonable to suggest that the bank’s credit policy favoured the
estate owners. Despite all the justifiable criticisms raised by the above mentioned
contemporary observers, this preference was in line with the fiscal and political
considerations and priorities o f the Ottoman government. First, most giftliks were
primarily engaged in cereal production, and most districts where giftliks were
particularly common were the leading centres of cereal production in the region.
Considering the predominant weight of cereal production and its crucial fiscal
importance for the government, we can suggest that providing financial support for
cereal producers was a reasonable policy objective, particularly in the depression struck
1880s and 1890s. From this strictly conjunctural perspective, it appears almost natural
that the estate owners would receive the lion’s share of the available public funds, due
to their involvement in cereal production. Indeed, a report published in the Journal of
the Istanbul Chamber of Commerce (Dersaadet Ticaret Odasi Gazetesi) reflects the
government’s clear concern to provide credit to estate owners in locations where giftliks
were particularly common, such as Selanik, Adana, Aydin and Yanya, during the 1880s
and the 1890s.73
We also know that the Ottoman government openly supported the production of
crops that remained within its fiscal reach during the Hamidian period. As it has been
noted in earlier chapters, the PDA appropriated the tithes accruing directly from the
production of silk, tobacco and spirits. Under the circumstances, the government’s
efforts concentrated primarily on providing support, fiscal or otherwise, to farmers of
crops taxable by the central government, such as cereals, cotton, opium, sesame,
72 The details of complaints over the distribution of public credits can be found in BA, TFR.1.MN., 4/355, 16.11.1320 (29.1.1905); BA, TFR.1.KV., 31/3080, 25.5.1321 (7.8.1905). 73D.T.O.G., 12.N.1312 (9.3.1895), N. 532: 109.
155


leguminous products, potatoes etc. Very little, and mostly technical, support was
provided to fanners engaged in tobacco production, sericulture and viticulture.74 This
seems to have been precisely the case in Selanik as well. The cereal producing districts
received an increasing share of the public funds, whereas the share of the districts
specialising primarily in the production of tobacco and in sericulture declined steadily
during this period. More specifically, Drama, Kavala, San-§aban, Cuma-i Bala,
Provide and Kesendire, all o f which were important centres of sericulture and tobacco
production, received a steadily declining portion of public funds. In the late 1880s and
the early 1890s, the share of these districts was 20%. By the late 1900s their share had
gone down to 10-15%.
However, it is interesting to note that the districts where cotton and opium
production was particularly prominent also received a diminishing share of the public
funds, despite their growing economic as well as demographic importance. For
instance, Siroz and Zihne, leading centres of commercial agriculture and especially of
cotton production, received a steadily declining share of the bank loans. Likewise, the
primary centres o f poppy cultivation, Kbprulu, Tikve§ and Istrumca received a
decreasing share o f the public funds. This is a peculiar situation, because one would
expect an uninterrupted and increasing flow of funds into these districts in accord with
the government’s willingness to support farmers specialising in the production of
commercial crops that brought tax revenue directly to the government. The clear
decline, both in absolute and relative terms, o f funds flowing into Siroz, Zihne and
Tikve§ compels us to pay attention to the political factors underlining the distribution of
public funds in this period.
The assignment o f an increasing share of public funds to cereal producing
regions where estates {giftliks) were particularly prominent, could well have been
associated with the growing political instability in the region. Local notables who were
typically Muslim landlords with considerable local power and influence owned most
estates. In this respect, the preservation of a strong Muslim contingent in the
countryside might have assumed political significance in the region, where ethnic
tensions and political instability were particularly noticeable and gradually intensifying.
The authorities considered the support of the notables, especially of the powerful
Muslim landlords, imperative for the preservation of the political status quo in the
region.75 It is likely that the assignment of public funds to landlords and other men of
local prominence was a way o f consolidating their fiscal profile and thus securing their
political position in the turbulent Macedonian countryside. In this sense, providing
credits to local magnates could well have served as a practical tool to affect a political

156


alliance between the local authorities and notables. Simple favouritism and outright
abuse of public authority might have also played a significant role in the allocation of
public loans to notables. However, the political motive stands out as the more likely
dynamic in the unequitable distribution of the public funds. This impression is
supported by the apparent, yet quite informal, ‘alliance’ that emerged between Muslim
landlords and the bank officers in the region, especially after the Bulgarian uprising of
1903. Reportedly the bank authorities often sequestered the lands o f Bulgarian and
Greek peasant farmers, who were indebted to the bank before the maturation date of
their loans and assigned the sequestered land to Muslim landlords. Such practices often
led to complaints and open conflicts between the new (Muslim) landlords and the
former owners of the sequestrated property. Interestingly enough, Muslim landlords,
who quite rhetorically argued that non-Muslim speculators were acquiring considerable
77
landed property in the region at their expense, also voiced similar complaints. These
accusations and counter-accusations carried a strong political overtone that complicated
the economic picture considerably. Clearly, there was intense political conflict over the
acquisition o f landed property in the region. Seemingly, the Agricultural Bank was an
important player in this process.
Overall, a shifting compromise between political priorities and fiscal
considerations of the Ottoman government seems to have influenced the credit policy of
the bank. Yet, the bank still contributed to the agricultural sector in important ways.
First, despite limitations, the Agricultural Bank did extend credits to thousands of
farmers, small and large. Some of these credits were definitely used for unproductive
purposes. For example, some peasant farmers simply used bank credits to relieve their
burden o f interest on their outstanding debts to the local landlords and moneylenders.
They simply transferred the debt burden to the bank, which charged a much lower
70
interest rate on relatively favourable terms of payment. In other instances, the money
was simply mismanaged and wasted in one way or another. Such cases probably ended
up in sequestrations and subsequent dispossession. In addition, however, the small
peasant farmers used the bank credits to purchase farm animals and seeds, to carry out
minor repairs and improvements in residential buildings, bams and gardens, to pay
taxes, and to purchase and repair farm tools and implements.
76 For comparisons see Akarli, “Abdiilhamid 13’s Attempt to Integrate”; Akarli, “Provincial Pow'er Magnates “. 77 See Chapter 4 for details. 78 Asir, 6.§.1314 (10.1.1897), N. 141: 4. At the time the average price o f a simple American plough was 125 kuru$es and the sieves cost 1,250 kurn§ts each. Therefore, with the O.L.400-500 in question a landlord could purchase 300-400 ploughs and 30-40 mechanised sieves. The sum involved is certainly considerable. Prices are based on the list published in OM.Z.M., ll.Za.1317 (12.3.1900), V.76, N.l: 26-31.

Finally, the profits o f the agricultural bank financed the reform efforts of the
provincial government. The expenses o f the agricultural school, model farms and the
salaries o f the agricultural inspectors were all paid by the bank profits accruing to local
government coffers. Similarly, the crisis management schemes, which we will discuss
in the next section, were all financed by the bank profits. In this respect, the bank’s
contribution to the reform efforts and to the overall stability of the sector must be
emphasised along with the drawbacks that hindered its operations.
3. Reform Efforts and Crisis Management: Obstacles and Promises
On the eve of the Hamidian era, customary techniques o f tillage and cultivation
dominated Selanik’s agrarian economy. Farm tools were o f the simplest kind. They
included the standard wooden ploughs, wooden-pronged pitchforks, flinted wooden
70
threshers, hand sickles, rudimentary wooden harrows and hand sieves. The production
methods were also conventional. Crop rotation was rarely practiced and fields were
normally left for fallow every second year round. The use o f fertilisers remained
confined to the application of animal pest during the fallow season.80 Irrigated
agriculture was also limited, and most farmers depended on annual rainfall for the
realisation of their crops. Finally, the main method used to increase production was land
reclamation from forests and woods.
These conventional techniques of production had been in use for centuries and
yielded satisfactory results both in terms of subsistence and commercial needs. This
technological base proved capable o f supporting the growing population of the region
and could uphold a regular and expanding export trade in agricultural products for
centuries. In this respect, the technology and methods of production used in the region
constituted a working technological base that was tested and had proved its worth on
numerous counts.
The conventional technology was also practical and easy to maintain. The
farmers could easily repair and even replace certain parts of their tools and farm
implements on their own. The odd iron-monger and the carpenter could undertake
repairs of a more complex nature and could provide the farming communities with
spare parts and new supplies at affordable costs. In this sense, the existing technological

Also see D.T.O.G., 11.C.1307 (22.1.1891), N. 266: 56-57 for a brief discussion o f farming techniques in the region.

158


base in agricultural production was sustainable and, perhaps more important,
economically feasible.
Finally, the conventional technology and methods of production developed
through a dynamic process, adapting themselves to local conditions and changing
circumstances over centuries. For instance, the existing methods of production
emphasised the liberal use of land, which constituted the abundant factor of production
in the region. Likewise, the technology in use was in accord with the climatic and
geological conditions o f the region. For example, the wooden ploughs that merely
scratched the surface o f the soil, without turning it inside out, suited to the arid climate
of the region well, as this method helped maintain the limited humidity of the soil.
Similarly, the inadequacy of irrigated agriculture was, among other things, due partly to
the salinity o f underground waters, which led to hardening of the soil and ultimately
rendered it uncultivable.81 The widespread practice of leaving fields for fallow was also
in tune with certain geological features of the region. In many parts, the soil was
deficient in some of the essential minerals, such as nitrogen. Therefore, regular
fallowing and the application of animal pest during the fallow season were imperative
to regenerate the strength of the soil and prevent its eventual exhaustion.
The effectiveness, practicality, economic feasibility and the environmental
suitability o f the existing technological base explain its persistence for centuries. As we
shall see, these factors continued to underscore the stickiriess of this technological base
also during the period under consideration. However, certain developments that took
place in this period rendered alternative modem technology somewhat attractive to
local farmers. In order to understand the underlining dynamics of this process, we must
first consider the drawbacks o f the conventional technology.
First, the conventional technology was not labour saving. This situation
constituted a serious problem in agricultural production, because labour constituted the
scarce factor of production in the region. In labour-dependent private estates (giftliks),
where a combination of sharecropping arrangements and seasonal wage-labour
typically constituted the primary form of labour procurement, the labour market
constraint was felt particularly strongly. The estate owners often sought alternative
ways o f cutting down on labour costs and finding ways of recruiting labourers under
81 F. Adanir, “The Macedonian Question: The Socio-economic Reality and Problems of its Historiographic Interpretation,” International Journal o f Turkish Studies, V. 3, N. 1, (1984-85): 45-47. The problem of salinity was particularly prominent in low-land plain locations, such as the Vardar and Siroz plains. 82Adanir, “The Macedonian Question,” 45-47.
159


more favourable conditions. Among other things, one of the options available to estate
owners was the introduction of labour-saving techniques and technology.83
Secondly, although the existing technology could, under ideal weather
conditions, yield quantitatively successful results, it could not always secure the quality
of the final produce. Especially in cereal production, the quality of the final crop could
not be secured with the rudimentary wooden pitchforks and hand sieves that were used
to clean the produce off the debris and chaff it naturally contained. This undermined the
quality o f local produce and constituted a serious disadvantage in marketing.84 Besides,
the hand sieves were not well suited to the selection of strong and healthy seeds for next
year’s sowing. Poor quality seeds often undermined the yield ratios and kept overall
or
levels o f productivity below the potential leyels by as much as 25-50.0%.
Finally, the technological base fell short of securing the stability of production
and left it highly exposed to weather conditions and natural factors. Heavy reliance on
rainfall increased the risks o f draughts, which could, and indeed did, lead to serious
crop failures and cause much economic distress for farming communities throughout
the region. Similarly, the absence o f dams and dykes along the riverbanks increased the
chances o f flooding in these ‘hydraulic’ locations. Also, the wooden ploughs that could
not cut the soil deeply and evenly, left seeds exposed to attack of hazardous animals
and insects.86
Two economic processes magnified the weaknesses of the existing
technological base and encouraged the adaptation of modem techniques of production
and technology from the early 1880s onwards. First, as we have seen in the previous
chapter, the severe depression in cereal prices caused a demand induced crisis in
regional cereal production and put local farmers under economic and financial strain.
Declining prices and tightening competition in international and domestic cereal
markets constituted an incentive to increase productivity, cut down on costs of
production, and improve the quality of marketed products. The second process that
encouraged the introduction o f productivity enhancing techniques was the tightening of
regional labour markets from the mid-1880s onwards. Accelerating seasonal migration
83 See Chapter 4. 84 See Chapter 2 for the problems emanating from the poor quality of marketed cereal output. 85 Asir, 4.C.1314 (10.11.1896), N. 124: 1; Asir, 11.C.1314 (17.11.1896), N. 126: 1. In both articles the agricultural inspector of the province of Selanik, Vitalis Efendi, was arguing that it would be possible to increase the seed yields from 8:1 to 10:1 or even to 12:1 by careful selection. Similarly, British vice-consul residing in the neighbouring province of Kosova, Mr. Shipley, was complaining that the seed yield ratios were remaining well below their potential due to “the very inferior quality of the seed which is foisted [by landlords] upon the peasants, over 30% o f which is weed...” (F.O.A.S., 1901, N. 2730: 23). 86 See D.T.O.G., 15.M.1305 (3.10.1887), N. 144: 33; D.T.O.G., 2.Za.l309 (28.5.1892), N. 387: 259; BA, §D-Orman, Maden ve Ziraat, 522/46, 1314; T.Z.N.M., 30.H.1328 (13.5.1912), N. 18: 262-263 for endemic grasshopper invasions in the region.

to Greece, Bulgaria and the Anatolian provinces in the aftermath o f the Russio-Ottoman
war gave way to acute labour shortages in rural areas. ,The tightness of rural labour
markets deemed it more difficult for landlords to find and recruit cheap labour for
employment in their estates.87 Under the circumstances, estate owners increasingly felt
the need to introduce labour saving techniques of production and technology.
Apparently, most contemporary sources understood the need to take innovative
steps on the technological front and emphasised, on numerous occasions, the
importance o f introducing productivity enhancing technology and certain new
techniques of production into agriculture. These measures included the introduction of
iron ploughs, mechanised sieves and reapers, effective combat against hazardous
animals, and the construction of extensive water management systems and irrigation
networks. The iron ploughs would help recover soil strength and allow for deep and
even tillage that ideally would improve overall productivity.88 The mechanised sieves
would undercut product and seed quality and provide farmers with an edge in marketing
and increase productivity.89 The reapers would also save on labour costs.90 Effective
combat against hazardous animals, such as mice, crows, and grasshoppers, would not
only improve overall productivity but also prevent frequent crop failures emanating
from the attack o f such animals.91 Finally, the construction of dams, dykes and canals,
ideally would reduce the vulnerability of agricultural production to adverse climatic
conditions.
Despite much acclaim the widespread introduction o f modem farming
techniques and technology remained limited. The projects that required extensive
capital outlays, such as the construction of water management systems and irrigation
networks remained extremely limited. In the British, French and Ottoman sources I
have consulted, I came across only a few, and mostly unsuccessful, attempts to carry
out such projects. For instance, repeated attempts to convert the marshes of the Vardar
River and Lake Yenice into arable land failed to materialise. These swamps remained
87P.P.A.S., 1886, N. 24: 5. **Asir, 11.§.1317 (14.12.1899); N.440: \;Asir, 21.C.1318 (16.10.1900), N.525: 1. 89Asir, 21.B.1314 (26.12.1896), N. 137:1. 90 According to one contemporary estimate a mechanised reaper could ideally reduce the cost of production by about 30% per donum o f land. See O.M.Z.M., 8.Za.l321 (27.1.1904), V .ll, N 119: 27. 91 Asir, 4.Z.1315 (25.4.1898), N.272: 1; Asir, 4.§.1315 (7.12.1899), N. 438: 1; Asir, 8.C.1318 (3.10.1900), N.521: 2. 92 Especially the silence o f the documents pertaining to the Imperial State Council (§ura-yi Devlet), especially to Public Works (Nafia), Commerce (Ticaret), Forests, Mines and Agriculture {Orman, Maden ve Ziraat), Contracts (Mukavelat) and provincial (Selanik) files, is quite telling. According to the 1858 Ottoman Land Law, land reclamations and construction o f buildings on miri lands had to be permitted by the government authorities and, usually, within die Ottoman bureaucracy such decisions passed through the State Council. Therefore, failure to detect such infrastructure investments among these files can be considered convincing evidence that such projects remained limited in the region throughout.
161


firmly in place without any significant improvement until the end of the penod.
Likewise, the attempts of a group of prominent notables and merchants led by the
chairman of the Istrumca Chamber of Commerce, Umur Bey, to drain off 10,000
donums (1,000 hectares) of flooded fields and to construct dams along the riverbanks of
the district also failed.94
Similarly, the construction o f canals and irrigation networks remained extremely
limited and was confined ,to the isolated, efforts o f a few prominent landlords and
merchant bankers. For instance, at a relatively late date, in 1904, Yako Savol
Modiyano, who was one o f the leading Jewish bankers o f Salonica, and Hifzi Bey, who
possibly was a local notable, combined their efforts to construct canals that would
connect the Vardar River to a certain giftlik situated in close proximity to the
riverbanks. An Italian engineer, Monsieur Ariogani, was employed in the construction
of the canal, which cost the two entrepreneurs a total of O.L. 1,000.95 The project was
successfully completed and the first rice and grain produce o f the farm was harvested in
1906.96
The Yako Savol and Hifzi initiative set an example in the district and other
landlords soon showed interest in similar projects. However, unless they had access to
firm financial sources it was very difficult, and indeed undesirable, for absentee
landlords to finance and maintain such extensive infrastructure outlets. Besides, the
construction of irrigation networks often called for the cooperative participation of
numerous neighbouring farmers. Such cooperation was not always easy to obtain.
Often, farmers with direct access to riverbanks were opposed to the passage of canals
through their property, considering it a net loss of arable land. Even when all parties
could agree to the legal, technical and financial terms of such projects, the actual
process of water management created difficulties, such as the adjustment of water levels
and the distribution of water between proximate and interior fields. These technical and
management difficulties further discouraged such costly infrastructure projects, which
would have ideally helped increase productivity and secure the stability of agricultural
production.97
The efforts to introduce modem farm implements also yielded limited success
until the early 1900s. In the sources I have consulted, I managed to find only a few
references to the introduction o f modem farm tools and implements. A report prepared
by Austria-Hungarian consul in 1885 mentions the importation o f some fifty reapers of

Johnston Manufacturing Co. of Balatavia into Salonica.98 However, all other
contemporary sources suggest “technological stagnation” in agriculture at least until the
turn of the century."
This stagnation can be attributed to a number of financial, technical and cultural
reasons. First, most farmers often found it difficult to afford modem farm tools and
machines in the depression struck 1880s and 1890s. The financial constraint was felt
strongly among peasant farmers in possession of small holdings, and many found it
difficult to purchase even the cheapest of modem farm implements, such as the iron
ploughs, and continued to rely on conventional tools. Also, the difficulties that the
farmers encountered in the acquisition of public credits and the exorbitance of the
interest rates charged in the private capital markets prevented the introduction of new
techniques and tools of production. In addition, other investments, such as
improvements in houses, farm buildings, fences, fountains, wells and the purchase of
additional farm animals, could well be so imperative as to push the purchase of new
tools and machines further down in the list of priorities.100
The absentee qiftlik owners, who had a better financial profile, probably found it
difficult to invest in new technology under adverse economic conjunctures. However,
the main factors that discouraged such investments appear to be more technical and
cultural than purely economic, as we shall see below.
Certain technical and logistic drawbacks constituted a serious, and possibly the
primary, obstacle to the modernisation of the technological base. The lack o f effective
agencies that could help choose, introduce, diffuse and maintain the appropriate
technology was particularly problematic.101 At least until the late-1890s, the
commercial houses importing agricultural machinery into the region were, in general,
poorly connected to the hinterland. Most suppliers lacked material representation in the
interior towns and often operated through the obscure agency of commercial travellers.
It seems that the farmers willing to import new farm implements, at times, found it
difficult to actually locate an appropriate intermediary who would be reliable not only
in the commercial transactions involved, but also in providing some sort of technical
support.102 Often, the farmers bought the equipment in an ad hoc manner. They either

102 Asir, 6.§.1314 (10.1.1897), N. 141: 4. In this account, an anonymous ?iftlik owner from Yenice complains that most farmers who were actually willing to import new machines could not find intermediaries in the area and were forced to go to Salonica to actually purchase the equipment. Eventually, the farmers did not import the ploughs. It is important to note that, Yenice was one o f the
163


had to rely on the word of the intermediary merchants or, whenever available, choose
from catalogues provided by the suppliers. In any case, often there was very little or no
didactic display. Without an informed choice the farmers could rarely be able to use the
tools in question properly.103 Occasionally, the local landlords who introduced modem
technology into their estates soon realised that that the new tools were not well suited to
local conditions. For instance, during the early 1880s, a number of estate owners
imported the most up-to-date iron ploughs from England. However, it soon became
apparent that these iron ploughs were too heavy for the local oxen and buffaloes. After
a few years o f persistent trial, the landlords threw aside the British ploughs and reverted
to the use o f conventional wooden ploughs.104
Inadequate provision of spare parts and technical support constituted another
problem for local farmers. The farmers were unfamiliar with the new technology and
often found the tools and implements difficult to use and maintain. The local iro n .
mongers were also not entirely informed about the exigencies of the new technology
and found it difficult to manufacture spare parts and to repair the new farm implements.
Under the circumstances, many farmers refrained from buying the unfamiliar and
complex technology that was difficult to maintain.105
Finally, certain cultural factors underlined the technological stagnation of the
1880s and the 1890s. First, most farmers and landlords had become suspicious of the
practicality o f modem technology after the failure o f early attempts to introduce new
farm implements and machines into estates. Moreover, the fact that the conventional
implements and tools constituted a working and proven technological base probably
underlined the disregard for new technology among the farming communities. Under
the circumstances, widespread scepticism emerged as another obstacle to overcome
before modem technology could be introduced in any considerable scale.
main agricultural centres in the region (1307 S.V.S., 1890: 48) and was situated along the ManastirSalonica railway line. (B. Gounaris, Steam over Macedonia, 1870-1912, Socio-Economic Change and the Railway Factor, (New York: East European Monographs, Boulder, Distributed by Columbia University Press, 1993), 51-53). 103 See Asir, 19.B.1313 (4.1.1896), N. 35: 2; Asir, 11.§.1317 (14.12.1899), N. 440: 1, for complaints about the lack of meaningful display and training on new farming techniques and tools. 104 D.T.O.G., 26.B.1302 (11.5.1885), N.. 10: 4; P.P.A.S.', 1886, N. 24: 5; Asir, 5.M.1314 (16.6.1896), N. 82: 1; 1318 K.V.S. (1900: 355-356). The technically and logistically inconsiderate importation o f technology is best illustrated in an example given by Baker: “I heard o f one instance o f a gentleman who had an estate on the sea shore and who spent £6000 on machinery, with the view of cultivating the land on a very extensive scale, but did not take into calculation the weight of the engines, etc., and die mechanical arrangements necessary for landing them The consequence was, they arrived at the beach o f the estate, but there was no provision for getting them on the shore from the lighters, and in the attempts to accomplish the task they sank into the sand and the sea ... I believe the engines lie in the sand to this day”. See Baker, Turkey. 105 See Asir, 3.§.1313 (18.1.1896), N. 577: 2 and O.M.Z.M., ll.Za.1317 (12.3.1900), V. 76, N. 1: 28-31, for complaints concerning the complexity o f imported technology and the difficulties encountered in finding spare parts in particular.
164


Second, absentee landlords residing in urban areas often had a relatively limited
understanding o f agriculture and showed little interest in the actual management of the
estates. Therefore, many giftlik owners probably were not interested in the introduction
of modem technology. It seems that many giftliks, especially small and medium-sized
ones, simply provided basic consumer goods, such as flour, leguminous products,
vegetables, fruit, diary products, poultry, eggs, meat, wood for fire, wines and spirits,
for the household of the absentee landlord. Thus, while maintaining their potential as a
source o f rent income and profit, the giftliks probably assumed a “provisionst”
significance for many absentee landlords. Consequently, productivity probably
remained a relatively marginal issue and the continuity of production assumed much
greater importance within the context of the giftlik economy.
Nevertheless, the labour market constraint still constituted an important
incentive to introduce labour-saving techniques and technology. In this regard,
however, the landlords faced the opposition of their tenants, who openly resisted the
introduction of new techniques that would undermine their position on the estates and
make them somewhat redundant in the work process. The resistance of tenant farmers
reportedly impaired the introduction of new technology into estates on numerous
occasions.106
The government could have played an important role in easing the technical and
cultural difficulties encountered in the introduction and diffusion of new technology
and techniques o f production throughout the countryside. In this context, the
government could have assumed active agency in choosing the appropriate technology,
providing farming communities with tools, farm implements, spare parts and technical
support, and carrying out educational programs that would display the advantages of
modem technology.
In practice, the government played only a limited, yet in certain ways important,
role in overcoming these obstacles. The local governments were more successful in
providing assistance in the choice and introduction o f appropriate technology.
However, the local authorities did little in terms of practical displays, giving
encouragement and education to farming communities, or providing supplies and
technical support.
The model farm attached to the Agricultural School played a leading role in the
first time introduction o f new farm tools and agricultural machines into the region
during this period. The model farm was equipped fully with the most up-to-date
106 Gounaris, Steam over Macedonia, 100. Also compare Quataert, Ottoman Reform, 168.
165


technology imported from abroad, chiefly from Britain, France and the United States.107
The imported tools and machines were used extensively on the ground and numerous
experiments were carried out to test their suitability to local conditions. For instance,
the staff carried out experiments with iron ploughs on the model farm and decided that
single bladed American ploughs were ideally suited to local conditions and to the
specific needs of the local farming communities. The American ploughs were simple in
design and easy to handle. They were also affordable and cheaper to maintain in
comparison both to other imported plough varieties and the conventional wooden
ploughs.108 Similarly, experiments with mechanised sieves yielded successful results
and showed that properly selected wheat seeds yielded between 1:10 to 1:15, as
opposed to the conventional 1:8 ratio.109 Also, the first tractors to be seen in the region
were introduced and tested in the model farm.110
The model farm also concentrated on introducing more advanced methods of
production. The most up-to-date techniques of production were successfully introduced
into the fields, vineyards, gardens and groves, and the mulberry plantations situated
within the model farm.111 New high yielding seed varieties of barley, summer wheat,
parrot seed and some new products, such as asparagus and potatoes, were tested.112 The
department o f sericulture also produced healthy silkworm eggs that were raised in
accord with the Pasteur methods.113 The departments of dairy products and animal
husbandry experimented with the production of pasteurised cheese, butter and yogurt
and introduced modem techniques of chicken and pigeon raising.114 The first
experiments to apply chemical fertilisers were also carried out in the model farm.115
In this period, the primary problem was in the dissipation of technology
throughout the countryside. In this respect, the inadequacy of agricultural experts and
other bureaucratic staff constituted a serious problem and largely circumscribed the

demonstrations and other means of inducement and encouragement. Nevertheless, the
agricultural inspectors did their best to help promote agricultural development and took
certain measures to enhance the diversity of production and contribute to the overall
stability o f the sector. In this context, the encouragement of cash crop production and
the crisis management schemes assumed great importance.
The local authorities actively encouraged the production of poppies in the
region. Agricultural inspectors were sent out to the countryside to show methods of
poppy cultivation and opium production to the farmers willing to take up the production
of the crop.116 Also, the government granted a one-year tax-exemption to farmers taking
117
up poppy cultivation to further encourage its production. The local authorities also
took measures that would help revitalise silk cocoon production in the region. As we
have seen, regional silk cocoon production had been badly hit by the malignant pebrine
disease in the 1860s and the 1870s. In order to help revitalise the sector, the government
took a number of precautions such as banning the importation o f uninspected silkworm
eggs into the region,118 and assisted the mulberry plant distribution schemes of the
PDA.119 Likewise, the authorities supported cotton cultivation. They imported
American and Egyptian seeds that yielded much better results in quality and quantity in
comparison to local cotton .varieties and distributed theni to cultivators throughout the
120
region.
The local authorities also devoted considerable energy and financial sources into
crisis management during this early period in order to secure the continuity of
production and overall stability of the sector. In this context, the government’s primary
concern was to counterbalance the dislocating effects of frequent harvest failures that
were triggered by adverse weather conditions, that is mainly draughts, and other natural
hazards, such as floods and grasshopper attacks. Apparently, the authorities used a
blueprint policy package to counterbalance the short and medium term effects of
harvest failures. A closer look at the ways in which they coped with the severe cereal
crop failures o f 1874, 1879, 1885-86 and 1888-90 reveals the pattern of crisis
management measures. To start with, all three harvest failures were triggered by
171
adverse weather conditions, i.e. either by severe draughts or untimely rams. In all
cases, the harvests materialised significantly below their average levels (by as much as

30-50%). At times and in certain places, the crops failed almost totally, causing acute
grain shortages. In each crisis, the local authorities, especially the local chambers of
commerce and agriculture, were alarmed by the inadequacy of local grain supplies and
immediately sent warnings to the central provincial vilayet officials urging them to take
instant measures in order to ensure grain supplies for local consumption needs. Upon
these requests, the vilayet brought the issue directly to the attention of the Porte, and
asked at once for, a) the imposition o f export prohibitions, which would secure regional
supplies and help redirect surplus grain earmarked for marketing towards the deficit
areas within the region, and, b) the transfer of additional monetary funds or in kind
provisions (seeds) with a view to help restore cereal production in the region.
Apparently, each time, the Porte responded with unusual speed and precision to the
requests. First, it issued the necessary legislative orders to back the prohibition of
exports and successfully resisted the protests of the local mercantile communities
involved in grain trade and the diplomatic pressure that European consuls put on the
1
government in the name o f liberal trade. Secondly, by granting tariff exemptions to
the farmers willing to import new seeds and by actively encouraging grain imports into
the region, the Porte not only secured sufficient supplies for local consumption, but also
indirectly encouraged the continuation of cereal production.123 Thirdly, through the
agency o f various public credit institutions, particularly through the inenafi sandiklari
and the Agricultural Bank branches, Istanbul provided the funds necessary to finance
the efforts to send provisions to the needy farmers. On numerous occasions, the local
bank branches distributed credit to the distressed farmers, thus providing them with the
financial means to purchase seeds and draft animals necessary to restore their interest in
cereal cultivation.124 In support of the measures taken by the bank, the local authorities
also assumed full responsibility in crises management and successfully executed seed
distribution schemes in selected disaster areas.125 As such, in the short term, the
Ottoman authorities played a crucial role in preventing harvest failures from reaching
famine proportions, and in the medium-term, helped maintain levels of cereal
production during these crucial years which were marked by a persistent depression in
the price of cereals.

Overall, government policy seems to have assumed, to a large extent, a
defensive overtone in the depression struck 1880s and the 1890s and prioritised stability
and greater diversification over modernisation as such. More notable progress seems to
have taken place on the technology front from the late 1890s onwards. In 1897, for
example, 406 iron ploughs, twenty-three mechanised sieves and seven miscellaneous
machines worth a total o f about 84,000 kuru§QS were imported into Salonica.126 In the
following year, about 248 iron ploughs, ninety-six mechanised sieves and nine
miscellaneous machines were imported and sold in Salonica at a cost of 144,000
kuru§Qs.127 In 1905, 216 iron ploughs, 30 sieves and 37 other machines including a .
tractor were imported and sold.128 Statistics pertaining to the late-1900s are lacking.
However, available qualitative sources suggest that the relative dynamism on the
17Q
technological front continued uninterrupted.
The underlining reasons for this relative dynamism can be attributed to a
number o f important institutional developments. In order to contain the growing ethnic
tensions in the Macedonian provinces, the Ottoman government implemented a series
of administrative, military and financial reforms in the early 1900s. Broadly speaking,
the primary objectives of this reform scheme was to enhance the administrative
capacity o f the government, improve public security, improve the fiscal profile of
provincial governments, and to generally better the economic and political conditions in
the region.
The details of this reform scheme shall not detain us here. It is important to note,
however, that, the reforms had serious repercussions on government’s agrarian policy .
as well and prioritised modernisation along with stability and diversification as a policy
objective. The clear emphasis on modernisation found its prime manifestation in a
reform proposal prepared by the local authorities and presented to the Sublime Porte.
This report underlined the significance of providing logistic and technical support to
farmers, o f further research into modem agricultural methods, greater diversification,
and improvement in product quality. To this effect, the report recommended the
employment o f additional agricultural inspectors, the establishment o f new model farms
and agricultural schools, and the foundation of numerous agricultural machinery depots
(zirai alet depolari) that would rent and sell new farm tools, implements and machines
130
on favourable financial terms to local farmers in leading centres o f agriculture.

169


Important measures were taken in the direction recommended by the reform
proposal during the late 1900s and the early 1910s. The local authorities opened another
model farm near Salonica in the early 1910s. The new model farm was situated in close
proximity to Salonica-Uskup and Salonic^-Istanbul railway lines and encompassed a
total area o f 14 hectares. The farm was fully equipped with modem farm implements
and machines, which included mechanised harvesters and water pumps. Experiments
with high-yield seed varieties and new agricultural products were also carried out in the
1^1 *
new model farm. In addition, numerous experimentations with modem farming
techniques, technology and agricultural products were carried out also in the newly
1
founded Agricultural School in Siroz.
The new school and the model farms also assumed a more active role in the
dissipation o f new technology and products throughout the countryside. They sent out,
free-of-charge, harvesters and mechanised sieves to near-by villages and estates during
peak harvest time to assist the farming communities and to demonstrate the advantages
of using these modem machines. For example, the Agricultural School in Siroz sent out
harvesters to the northern districts of Cuma-i Bala and Nevrekop and provided good
quality cotton and maize seeds to local farmers in Siroz in 1912.133
Another significant development in this later period was the establishment of
agricultural machinery depots in leading centres of agriculture throughout the region.
The largest depot was established in the district of Selanik. This depot sold a wide
range o f farm implements and machines, which included iron ploughs, mechanised
sieves, iron harrows, hoes, reapers, harvesters, beehives, butter-chums, machines used
to make milk cream and spare parts. Smaller depots were also established in Siroz,
Istrumca, Drama, Vodine, Karaferye and Yenice. These secondary depots only sold
essential tools and machines, such as iron ploughs, hand sieves, harrows, hoes, reapers,
beehives, butter-chums, cream machines, and spare parts. In every depot, there was a
workshop that could repair old machines and other farm implements and provide spare
parts.134 The depots offered low prices and favourable terms of payment to cultivators.
Each item was sold to farmers for 20.0% below its retail price, and the payments were
spread over a period of five years. More costly machines, such as sieves, reapers and
harvesters, could be rented out from the depots in return for a small fee and put to work
in estates and villages under the supervision of agricultural inspectors.135

The more active involvement of agricultural schools and model farms in the
dissemination of new technology and especially the establishment of the agricultural
machinery depots must be considered important developments that underlined the
relative dynamism on the technological front from the early 1900s onwards. The
agricultural depots appear to have been particularly important in this respect. In 1909
alone, the depots sold numerous agricultural machinery, including a total of 153 iron
ploughs, 715 spare iron blades for imported ploughs, six mechanised sieves, thirty
harvesters, 697 beehives and 100 other miscellaneous farm tools and machines.136 The
next year, the depots sold another 138 iron ploughs and numerous machines.137 Besides,
the repair and other services provided by the depots probably helped ease the technical
problems encountered in the maintenance and adaptation o f new technology and
contributed to the relative technological dynamism of this period.
We cannot attribute this relative dynamism solely to the efforts of the Ottoman
government. We should also take into consideration the active involvement of private
initiatives in this process. First of all, the agents of agricultural machine manufacturers,
especially from Germany, Austria-Hungary and the United States, seem to have
improved their connections in the hinterland and started working with local agents,
rather than the odd commercial traveller.138 The suppliers also put greater emphasis on
the provision o f spare parts.139 In addition, the establishment of a number o f workshops
in Salonica, which manufactured, among other things, simple farm implements and
spare parts, was another important development that helped ease the technical and
logistic difficulties encountered in the introduction o f new technology in the previous
decades.140
Second, it seems that the landlords and local notables began to assume a more
active role in the introduction and, perhaps more importantly, the dissemination of new
techniques. For instance, upon the suggestions and persistent encouragement of Vitalis
Efendi, Haci Nafi Bey from Istrumca agreed to import 100 iron ploughs and sold the
136 T.Z.N.M., 30.11.1328 (13.5.1912), N. 18: 266-267. 137PRO, F.O., 195/2359,24.11.1910, Lamb to Marling. 138 PRO, F.O., 195/2111, 23.3.1901, Freeman to O’Connor; O.M.Z.M., ll.Za.1317 (12.3.1900), V. 76, N. 1: 28-31. The latter source gives detailed information on the names o f agents importing and selling machines and farm implements throughout the Macedonian countryside. Most of these agents are cited as ‘merchants’ (tiiccar). However, there are also the names o f landlords and prominent government officers listed as ‘men o f interest’ (eshab-i alaka). Also see P.P.A.P., 1905, N. 3655: 11 for the penetration o f machinery suppliers deeper into the Macedonian hinterland. 139 T.Z.M.N., 25.Ca.1330 (13.5.1912), N. 18: 266-267. 140Asir, 20.§.1324 (11.10.1906), N. 1119: 4 ; ^ r , 26.Z.1318(15.4.1901), N. 574: 2; 1315S.V.S. (18??: 578). It seems that at least one such workshop producing iron furnaces and farm implements was established in Salonica during this period. The factory manufactured iron ploughs based on American and Greek models and a wide range of spare parts for imported foreign machines and other farm implements. A second concern was established in the late-1900s within the context o f the Salonica Hamidiye Industrial school (1320 S.V.S., 1903, 392). However, the contribution o f this concern remained limited as it was primarily intended for educational purposes.

tools to the local farmers for about 20% below their retail price.141 In 1900, another
landlord from the district of Selanik bought a mechanised sieve for O.L. 14 and after
cleaning his own produce, set out to sieve the grain harvest of the neighbouring farms
and villages in return for small contributions.142 The same year, numerous landlords
undertook similar measures and imported 50 mechanised sieves and made the machines
available for general public use in their respective districts.143 In 1904, landlords from
the district of Selanik successfully introduced the use of modem machinery in their
estates.144 Some prominent notables even went so far as to import fancy tractors around
1900s. Upon the encouragement o f Vitalis Efendi again, the brother of a certain
Siileyman Pa§a, Ali Bey bought a tractor worth O.L. 400 in 1905. The machine could
till 30 to 40 donums of land per day and, with its fifteen horsepower traction, could till.
the land 30 to 40 centimetres deep.145 Within ten days, two prominent landlords, Hifzi
and Rahmi Beys, combined their financial means to import another tractor with exactly
the same qualifications.146 Probably, other landlords took similar measures, but, their
efforts remained limited and went under-reported in the available sources.147
The underlining reasons for the landlords’ growing interest in the introduction
of new technology are not easy to ascertain. However, it is possible to make a few
suggestions. First, the above mentioned developments in logistics, namely the
encouragement and support o f government officers and the technical guidance of the agricultural school and the model farm(s), might have played an important role in
enticing landlords to introduce new technology into their estates.
Second, labour scarcity seems to have incited the adaptation of productivity
enhancing technology, especially iron ploughs, reapers and mechanised sieves, into the
estates. Especially, the acceleration o f emigration to Greece, Bulgaria and the U nited.
States, the growing attraction of booming urban sectors, and the rapid growth of cash
crop production, particularly of tobacco production seem to have aggravated the
difficulty o f finding and recruiting agricultural workers in the estates by the end of the
first decade of the century.

Also the above mentioned report published in the journal o f the Ministry o f Forests, Mines and Agriculture mentions many landlords and man of local prominence, who imported small numbers of machines and other farm implements directly from suppliers (O.M.Z.M., ll.Za.1317 (12.3.1900), V. 76, N. 1: 28-31). For instance, a certain Suad Bey from Selanik imported a chicken machine in 1897 (BA, Irade-Rusumat, 735/382-5, 16.R.1315 (13.9.1897)). It Is highly probable that these silent, yet significant, efforts continued into the 1910s.
172


Despite the growing landlord interest the introduction of new technology and
techniques of production remained limited even in this later period. The introduction of
new technology remained confined to a number of giftliks owned by prominent notables
and merchants. The problem was that the new technology and techniques of production
could not reach all the way to the thousands of peasant farmers, who continued to
constitute the backbone Of agriculture in the region. Despite the improvements
discussed above, agency problems, financial constraints, different investment priorities,
the ‘stickiness’ of the existing technological base, preconceptions and ignorance
persisted to create insurmountable difficulties for the dissemination of new technology.
In 1911, the British consul residing in Salonica was reporting to London that, despite
the efforts o f local authorities, the ‘insurmountable conservatism’ of the majority of
farmers in the region was a serious impediment to the general employment of up-to
148
date agricultural machinery. The “insurmountable conservatism” of local fanners
was underlined by the above-mentioned set of complex economic and technical factors.
The attempts to promote greater diversification in agriculture and to support
farmers willing to produce (taxable) cash crops and other agricultural products
continued also in this later period. For example, the authorities set up special
committees for the inspection of silkworm eggs imported into the region. These
measures contributed significantly to the containment of the pebrine disease and the
growth of silk cocoon production in the region, particularly after the turn of the
century.149 Similarly, the support provided to cotton cultivators continued. The
distribution of high yielding seed varieties that were better suited to the arid climate of
the region contributed to the growth of cotton cultivation in important ways, at least
until the commencement of the unprecedented boom in tobacco cultivation early in the
twentieth century.150 The authorities encouraged farmers also to produce alternative
crops such as red peppers, roses, fruit, and vegetables.
The crisis management schemes continued as well. Now, however, the
government largely failed to maintain the levels of cereal production, due mainly to the
sheer persistence and scope o f harvest failures that hit the region between 1897 and
1910. In the pre-1897 period, harvest failures materialised sporadically and their after
effects usually did not last more than a year or two. In 1897-1910, the harvest failures
proved more persistent and could last as long as four to five years in succession as they
did in 1897-1902 and 1907-1910. Contemporary European sources maintain that
unusually severe climatic conditions and mainly severe droughts caused these fits of
harvest failure. Chronic underinvestment in cereal production, especially
i n F.O.A.S., 1911, N. 5017: 8. 149Asir, 13.Ca.1325 (24.6.1907), N. 1190: 2;R.C.L., 1908, N. 250-255: 830-831. 150BA, §D-Ticaret, 1213/17, 21.N.1316 (4.2.1899); D.T.O.G., 5.L.1315 (26.2.1898), N. 686: 6869; Asir, 23.N.1322 (1.12.1904), N. 935: 2.
173


underinvestment in irrigation and drainage, and the acceleration o f rural de-population
must have also played a significant role in deepening the effects of unfavourable
weather conditions. At any rate, the impact of these two uninterrupted runs of harvest
failure was quite severe and entailed a notable contraction in regional cereal production
in this later period.
The Ottoman government remained consistent in implementing crisis
management schemes and went on to support the needy cultivators. The available
archival documents suggest that the seed distribution schemes, tariff exemptions, cheap
credit procurements all remained in effect. For instance, the Agricultural Bank extended
credits to the needy farmers in the Siroz district upon orders of the local authorities.151
Given the growing attraction o f cash crop production, especially that of tobacco, and the
sheer magnitude and persistence of harvest failures, it was difficult to sustain cereal
production through crisis management policies or other similar measures. Yet, it is fair
to suggest that the cereal producers o f the region would have suffered severely from the
harvest failures in the absence o f the government’s persistent efforts to contain the
crisis. In this sense, the government’s contribution to the overall stability of the sector
must be highlighted.
Conclusion
From a comparative perspective, what the Ottoman government could not do
strengthen and modernise agriculture appears to have been more consequential than
what it actually did. Examples of successful agrarian modernisation under the auspices
of the government are abundant and set the counterfactual against which we can assess
the role o f government policy in the Ottoman empire during the late nineteenth and the
early twentieth centuries. For instance, the effective protection provided by corporatist
governments in the European continent contributed to the modernisation and growth of
agriculture.152 Likewise, the guiding support and the active encouragement provided by
the Japanese government to farming communities contributed to the rapid development
of the sector during the Meiji period.153 In contrast, bounded by the terms of the liberal

trade agreements signed with European powers, the Ottoman government could not
provide the same degree of protection to farmers. Under the circumstances,
government’s ability to provide technical, logistic and financial support became
extremely important for the strength and robustness of the sector in the Ottoman
Empire. However, the organisational feebleness of the Ottoman government, which was
ultimately due to its financial and political weakness, withheld its ability to provide
effective support to the agricultural sector. Efforts towards this end often yielded limited
results, remained confined to a number of commercial centres, and failed to bring about
the desired effect in agricultural modernisation. The diplomatic, fiscal and political
constraints of the Ottoman government largely set the background to the apparent
“weakness” and vulnerability o f the agricultural sector during the period under
consideration.
Selanik was not an exception. Although the authorities managed to take
important steps in the introduction o f new means and methods o f production in the
agricultural schools and model farms, they failed to encourage the diffusion of this new
technology throughout the countryside, mainly because o f serious financial and
institutional constraints. Some success could be achieved in this regard only towards the
end o f the period, but the accomplishments were limited in scope and remained
confined to a limited, if significant, number of estates. Indirect measures, such as tax
exemptions and encouragement schemes yielded results that were more considerable
and assisted the development of commercial agriculture, especially the growth of cash
crop production, in the region. Likewise, the successful crisis management schemes
helped maintain the overall stability of agricultural production to a certain extent.
Consequently, we can consider the Ottoman state as a facilitator o f commercialisation
and stability in the sector.
Within the limits o f this overall policy, the authorities appear to have
compromised fiscal concerns for pressing political priorities. This tension becomes
particularly apparent in the distribution of public funds through the medium of the
Agricultural Bank. Clearly, the bank provided some support to the farming communities
under acute economic distress. The bank credits enabled these communities to better
respond to market signals in the short term and gave them the financial edge necessary
to maintain their ownership status over land in the medium term. The bank also
provided funds for the reform and ‘crisis management’ schemes o f the government. For
175


all these reasons, the contribution of the bank to the overall stability and
commercialisation o f the agrarian economy must be emphasised. However, the
Agricultural Bank also appears as a great under-achiever, or rather a missed
opportunity, in terms o f facilitating modernisation in agriculture. The predominance of
notables in public credit markets seriously undermined the potential of the bank to
contribute to agricultural development. In this context, the political considerations of the
state and its efforts to maintain the influence of Muslim notables in the countryside
appear to be particularly important.
Some notables responded to the support of the Ottoman government and took
active initiative to modernise and enhance production, but only towards the end of the
period and under extremely distressing political conditions. However, these efforts
remained limited and came too late to make a lasting difference in the sector. The
disintegration following the Balkan Wars virtually demolished all and it was up to
Greek authorities to revitalise agriculture in the region in the aftermath of the Great
War. The delayed response o f the local notables to the support and encouragement of
the Ottoman government can only be understood against the backdrop of the broader
distributional processes at work. In the following chapter we turn our attention to a
discussion of property rights, tenure systems and taxation to complete our analysis of
the dynamics of agrarian change in the Selanik region during the period under
consideration.

CHAPTER-IV
THE DYNAMICS OF DISPOSSESSION AND THE LOGIC OF RENT-SEEKING:
PROPERTY RIGHTS, TENURE SYSTEMS AND TAXATION
Introduction
In the previous two chapters, I have discussed the forces underlining the
transformation of the agrarian economy at large. I have argued that the dynamic
interplay between world economic forces and the modernisation efforts o f the Ottoman
government led to the emergence o f a “dual” agricultural economy in the region,
involving retarded and rapidly growing sub-sectors. I have noted that the sub-sectors
that articulated well with the world economy grew rapidly in response to robust
overseas demand and the active support o f the offshoots of European economic interests
in the region, namely large trading houses and the Ottoman Public Debt Administration
(PDA). Silk cocoon, opium and especially tobacco cultivation grew rapidly in the region
under such favourable demand side conditions, and with the financial, technical and
logistic support of the above mentioned establishments. In contrast, the sub-sectors that
were not favoured by the conjuncture o f the world economy went into a process of
serious retardation, despite the government’s efforts to promote economic growth and
stability in these “excluded” sub-sectors of the agrarian economy. The fiscal and
organisational feebleness of the Ottoman government, and certain institutional
inadequacies, which manifest particularly in the organisation of the marketing
processes, undermined efforts to modernise agriculture. In this process, prohibitive
transaction costs that were superimposed by the reckless tariff policy of railway
companies and the lack or ineffectiveness of market regulation proved particularly
detrimental, and the ensuing transaction cost constraint further undermined the growth
potential o f the “excluded” sub-sectors.
177


In this chapter, I will discuss the transformation o f socio-economic institutions
that conditioned the direction and pattern of economic change in the Selanik region
during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In this broad context, I will pay
close attention to distributional processes, and concentrate on the connections between
property rights, systems of land tenure, and taxation, on the one hand, and processes of
capital accumulation, commercialisation, and urbanisation, on the other. I will utilise an
eclectic analytical framework in discussing these complex issues. I will borrow from
two established traditions' in economic and social history, namely neo-Marxism and
neo-institutionalism. I will use the neo-Marxist approach to discuss mainly, a) the
pattern o f surplus appropriation and capital accumulation in the regional economy, and
b) the dynamics o f rural displacement, dispossession and urbanisation.1As such, I hope
to discuss the structural processes and the institutional dynamics underlining the crisis
of the agrarian economy, on the one hand, and the growing tide of urbanisation in and
emigration out of the region, on the other. I will also borrow from neo-institutionalism
to discuss the forces underlining the commercialisation o f the regional economy at
large, and that o f the agricultural sector in particular.2 I will concentrate on the relations
of property and distribution as important determinants of how and to what extent
economic agents could be incorporated into the market economy. More specifically, I
will discuss property rights, systems of land tenure and taxation as crucial institutional
processes that conditioned the incentive structures faced by economic agents. As such, I
hope to shed light on the acute under-investment in agriculture and on the forces that
underlay the persistence o f strong speculative motives in the regional economy.

Before proceeding any further, however, it is necessary to clarify some of the
conceptual and methodological issues central to this discussion. First, it is important to
re-emphasise that the nineteenth century Ottoman economy was an inseparable part of
the still expanding global capitalism. As we have seen in previous chapters, local
economic structures evolved and metamorphosed in tandem with this tide of
globalisation. Distributional processes and property relations were not isolated from this
process o f articulation and metamorphosis. Quite to the contrary, they represented an
important socio-economic domain within which the process of globalisation was starkly
felt. However, the social and economic domain of redistribution and of property also
constitutes a multi-layered and complex arena of political power struggles and o f social
and economic conflict. l a this sense, the distributional processes and relations of
property consist of context bound historical contingencies, which can dissect, distort,
and at times resist against the global processes at work.
The dynamic interaction o f the “local” and the “global” processes underscored
the emergence o f an amorphous economic structure in Ottoman lands that dialectically
accommodated elements both in line with the moment of globalisation, on the one hand,
and those that undermined or mitigated it, on the other. In other words, the socio
economic domain as defined by property relations and distributional processes embody
the tensions and contradictions, and indeed the peculiarities, of the “Ottoman” path to
peripherisation and modernity. In this respect, they constitute an important, if
indispensable, component of economic change and transformation. As we shall see, the
case of Ottoman Selanik proves no exception.
In what follows, I will first introduce the basic features o f the classical Ottoman
land regime and discuss its broad transformation from the sixteenth century onwards.
This long-term perspective on land and taxation matters will set the historical and
conceptual background against which I will consider the transformations taking place in
Selanik during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The discussion will
mainly centre around two broad issues; namely, the gradual consolidation of property
rights and increasing commercialisation of land as a primary factor of production. In
addition, I will concentrate on the Ottoman taxation system, and assess its impact on the
processes o f capital accumulation, and the organisation of the relations of production in
179


agriculture. In the second section, I will consider the developments in Selanik and
concentrate mainly on the institutional framework within which property rights were
secured and enforced, and the legal stipulations that helped proprietors to appropriate
the surplus produce. In the third section, I will discuss the implications of these legal,
institutional and organisational conditions for the transformation of the regional
economy, in conjunction with economic and political developments.
1. The Transformation of the Ottoman Land Regime and Systems of Taxation: A Long-Term Perspective
The pillars of the Ottoman political status quo during the “classical” period
rested on the extensive coordinating powers of a relatively centralised patrimonial state
apparatus. The patrimonial state mediated processes of political integration,
redistribution, and of warfare through a network of interlocking and hierarchical
tributary arrangements.3 In Islamic jurisprudence, conquest constituted one of the
primary means through which ownership over land could be established. Conquest gave
proprietary rights to the Islamic community (umma), and the Islamic state, as the
custodian o f the rights o f the umma and of the Islamic, or §er 7, order at large, emerged
as the primary legitimate authority that could establish proprietary rights over
conquered lands.4

Findley, Bureaucratic Reform in the Ottoman Empire: The Sublime Porte, 1789-1922, (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1980). For a more refined version of the Weberian approach see K.Barkey, Bandits and Bureaucrats, The Ottoman Route to State and Centralisation, (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1994); and, F. Gofek, The Rise o f the Bourgeoisie and the Demise o f the Empire, (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996). Also see H. Inalcik, The Ottoman Empire, The Classical Age, 1300-1600, 1. P.

The practice of bringing conquered lands under the custodianship of the state
served two important purposes. First, this practice enabled the state to collect taxes from
conquered lands. This was indispensable for the creation of a public treasury and for the
upkeep o f the broader state apparatus and its armies. Secondly, the state largely drove
its legitimacy from its ‘custodianship’ over the rights held by the umma as stipulated by
the fundamental principles o f §er ’i law. The preservation of umma*s right to benefit
from all worldly possessions (ayn), that ultimately belonged to God, was particularly
important for establishing a solid ideological basis for legitimate rule in tune with the
precepts o f Islamic legal tradition.5
The Ottomans inherited these Islamic practices, as well as some of the deep
rooted Byzantine conventions, and brought much of the conquered land under the direct
custodianship o f the state and hence the public treasury. These lands were termed state
{miri) lands.6 The political, economic and military power o f the Ottoman state rested
upon its legitimate control over the miri lands. The sultan granted military fiefs (dirliks)
to prebendal families and other members of the military class. The appointed fief
holders (timariots) held the rights to revenue collection within the dirlik territory. In
addition, the timariot was given a private plot (hassa giftlik) for his subsistence needs.
In return, the timariot was responsible for the upkeep o f a certain number o f cavalrymen
and for serving in the Ottoman army during military campaigns. The timariot was also
accountable for maintaining public order within the dirlik territory and for regulating
matters pertaining to taxation.7
Within the context of the miri land system, the actual occupiers of the land, i.e.
the peasant cultivators (reaya) in possession of small holdings (gift-hane), held usufruct

(tasarruf) rights.8However, the state held the plain ownership (rakabe) of the land. This
situation practically rendered the occupier of the miri land to be the state’s perpetual
“tenant”. This tenancy relation between the state and the tenant was expressed in a
special contractual deed called the tapu. Thq tapu contract set the terms and conditions
of tenancy and specified the obligations of the raiyyet. These obligations mainly
included the regular payment of all §er’i and customary (orfi) taxes certain services due
to the state and the timariot. In return, the holder of the tapu deed acquired exclusive
rights o f possession and usufruct. Yet, the tenant could not independently carry out
certain legal transactions and make alterations on land that entailed rights of plain
ownership. That is, the miri land could not be independently leased, sold, mortgaged,
shown as collateral or bequested by the raiyyet. Only the usufruct rights held by the
tenant could be transferred' (ferag) to a third party, conditional upon the payment of a
transfer fee and the permission o f the local timariot granted before the local Islamic
courts. Similarly, the fields under cultivation could not be converted into orchards and
vineyards, as these alterations would altered the miri status of the land into freehold
property (,miilk), in accordance with certain principles of §er’i law (see below).
Similarly, the law prohibited the construction of buildings and the planting of fruit trees
without special permits.9
The miri system of land tenure and the associated dirlik system were imperative
for the broader organisation of the Ottoman political status quo and for the
consolidation o f state power. First, the state maintained its ultimate ownership over
conquered lands and thus jealously retained its rights over land matters and control over
taxation. Second, the separation of usufruct rights from plain ownership over miri lands
and the associated restrictions brought over the sale, transfer and mortgage of such
property enabled the central government to the subsistence o f the peasant farmers and to
prevent, at least in theory, their alienation from the land through dispossession. The
preservation of small peasant proprietorship helped keep the countryside politically
pacified. The (unarmed) peasant farmers constituted a politically more manageable
social group that could not directly challenge the authority of the state and the sultan.
8 For the legal position of cultivators see inalcik, “The Ottoman State,” 108; Barkan, Tiirkiye’de Toprak Meselesi, 725-788.
9 For a detailed discussion of usufruct rights over miri lands see Cin, Osmanli Toprak Duzeni, 115-166, and Sonmez, Osmanli’dan Guniimiize Toprak, 52-54,201-203.
182


Besides, the dirlik system helped finance the upkeep o f a police force in the provinces
and served as an important mechanism of social control and political pacification.10
The dirlik system also helped contain the power base of the local military
contingent. As we have seen, the assignment (tejviz) o f the miri lands to peasant farmers
presupposed the separation of usufruct rights from that of revenue collection, which
withheld, at least in theory, the local timariot from emerging as a powerful feudal lord
over the dirlik territory. The authority of the timariot was further checked by the
presence o f local judicial authorities that effectively prevented him from monopolising
all powers o f jurisdiction, policing and of surplus appropriation in his person. The
sultan’s capacity to transfer and dismiss fief holders was also important in
circumscribing the timariot9s power and securing his obedience to central authority.
Finally, the upkeep of a central army directly loyal to the person of the sultan
empowered him with considerable powers of negotiation, deterrence and, when
necessary, armed intervention against the provincial military elite.11
Thus, a structural link between processes o f surplus appropriation, military
organisation and social control was established within the context o f the classical dirlik
system. The state’s custodianship and control over the miri lands constituted the very
basis o f this organisational process.
The miri lands constituted the primary axis of the Ottoman land regime in the
early modem period.12 Yet, other forms of property also prevailed. Islamic
jurisprudence recognised land reclamation as another important source of establishing
proprietorship over land. Individuals who converted ‘dead’ (mevat) lands into arable
land could acquire proprietary rights over the thus “vivified” lands, provided that they
acted with due permission and knowledge of the judicial authorities. Such lands became
the freehold property (miilk) of the individuals who ‘vivified’ them. Islamic
jurisprudence, as well as other Ottoman practices emanating from established customs
(orf), also recognised as freehold property, a) the lands within or in close proximity of
towns and villages; b) orchards, vineyards and gardens; c) former miri lands sold to
private parties; c) some o f the lands granted to participants in military campaigns; and,

d) some lands left in possession o f Christians who converted to Islam following the
conquest. The recognition of these lands as freehold mtilk property was conditional
upon the acquisition of the title-deed (temlikname) from judicial authorities or directly
from the sultan.13
The proprietor (malik) of the mtilk land could sell, transfer, use and benefit from
it, subject to minor restrictions and the usual §er’i and customary taxes.14 Mtilk lands
could be inherited directly by the children, parents, spouses, siblings and other
immediate relatives (<asabe) of the deceased proprietor.15 Mtilk lands were inviolable
properties o f the malik and the malik could exclude others from using and benefiting
from it. Mtilk property could not be easily confiscated. §er'i law allowed for
confiscation primarily to protect the property from damage and deterioration. For
instance, in cases o f extreme (fahi§i) abuse; the malik could lose his/her proprietary
rights.16 The state could confiscate mtilk for public interest as well; however, such
seizures could be carried out only under extraordinary circumstances and the state was
obliged to pay the full value o f the property to the malik in question.17
Mtilk property could be endowed to pious foundations and other charitable
organisations as set by the fundamental principles of §er ’i law. According to the §er'ia,
the endowment of property for religious or charitable purposes had to be the personal
act of an individual out o f His/her devotion to God. Thus, only mtilk lands could be used
to form a vakif. Such vakifs were termed as 'real1, or 'proper', vakifs {yakf-i sahih),
whereby both the ownership and the usufruct rights of the owner were transferred in
perpetuity to the legal entity of the vakif itself*.18 The property donated to a vakif was
12 inalcik suggests that about 87% o f land was miri in the early sixteenth century and most of this miri land was administered under the timar system (Inalcik, The Ottoman Empire, 110).

18 Another form o f vakifwas the one formed by the endowment o f state {miri) lands, or rather of the revenue that accrued from them. This type constituted a deviation from the §er’i principle that defined a vakifas the pious act of an individual. Consequently, vakifs formed by the assignment o f miri land were called the gayr-i sahih (improper) vakifs. Only the sultan, or a person authorised by him, had the liberty to permit the use of miri lands for the formation of such endowments, and on the condition that they served clearly defined religious or charitable purposes beneficial to all Muslims and/or the public in general. The
184


definitive and inalienable; that is, it could not be reconverted into mtilk once donated to
a vakif.19The endower/founder (vakif) had the right and the obligation to determine the
exact purpose and organisation of the vakif The vakifs were also exempt from the non
§er'i taxes, and were thus subject to considerably lighter fiscal dues.20 This fiscal
advantage constituted the primary economic motive in converting mtilk lands into vakif
status. Besides, the vakifs enjoyed other privileges that brought considerable economic
advantages for the administrators o f vakif property. For instance, the endower could
stipulate in the vakif deed that the management of the vakifs should be inherited by his
descendants.21 The lands donated to a vakifwere inalienable properties of the vakif That
is, they could be leased, "but not sold or bought as freehold property; [they were] not
subject to suit and seizure for nonpayment of debt, so could not be used in the ordinary
way as security for borrowing".22 In this sense, the administrators o f the vakifs and their
heirs could benefit from the property on quite favourable fiscal terms, without having to
worry about loosing the property as a result of indebtedness and other financial
obligations. A vakif was also entitled to collect a fair rent, that is rent at the going
market rate, from its tenants under the protection o f the law. Thus, the vakifs emerged as
the rent-yielding property par excellence within the context o f the Ottoman land
regime.23
The Ottoman land regime underwent a fundamental transformation during the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Underneath this process lay fiscal problems of the
Ottoman state. The need to adapt to new and expensive military technologies, and
frustrating wars fought over a vast territory for extended time periods put incessant
pressure on state finances and constantly drained revenues accruing to the imperial
treasury. The cost o f keeping and training regular professional armies equipped with
expensive military hardware in ever-larger numbers put a regular (cash) burden on the
state retained its basic ownership rights (rakabe) on such property, but the right to administer the property was transferred to the endowment as stipulated by its deed. See Cin, Osmanli Toprak Dtizeni, 37.

treasury and intensified the fiscal crisis. In addition, the growing administrative
expenses of the Ottoman government ruling over a vast empire, one that stretched from
central Europe to the Caucuses and from Crimea to Yemen further exacerbated the
fiscal problems. These adverse fiscal circumstances called for a substantial realignment
of Ottoman state finances. Here, the primary challenge that the Ottomans faced was the
creation of alternative sources o f cash revenue for the central treasury and the adoption
of more intensive and “monetised” methods of tax collection.24
The Ottoman response to the emergent fiscal crisis was quite mixed and
involved a number o f fiscal, financial, and monetary measures. Domestic borrowing, the
regular debasement o f the currency, the introduction of new taxes, the sale of miri lands
as mtilk property to private parties, and the attempts to impose tighter fiscal controls on
vakifs were some o f the measures taken by the Ottoman government in response to the
mounting fiscal crisis.25 From the viewpoint of our discussion, the most important
development took place probably within the miri system o f land-tenure. The Ottoman
government systematically waived some of its control over the miri lands to gain certain
short-term fiscal advantages. One o f the most consequential developments in this regard
was the gradual expansion o f the practice of tax farming throughout the imperial
domains.
Tax farming, or iltizam, was already a common form of tax collection during the
classical period. The collection of the taxes due on miri lands assigned to the central
treasury or other imperial revenue sources such as customs were regularly auctioned off
to individuals in return for an up-front cash payment (maktu). These miri lands were
termed mukataali, or miri mukataa. According to this arrangement, which was similar
to a rental transaction, the lease holder acquired the right to collect the due taxes for a
specified period o f time as stipulated by the rental contract drawn between the state and
the lease-holder. Following the termination o f the contract, usually after one or two
years, a new agreement had to be reached and another maktu payment made before the
tax farmer could assume the same tax collection privileges.26

Although tax farming constituted an important method o f revenue collection for
the imperial treasury throughout the classical period, the practice remained largely
confined to the lands where revenue was assigned directly to the public treasury. The
miri lands granted as dirliks were kept outside the tax farming system. However, tax
farming was gradually extended to include the dirliks assigned to the provincial military
cavalry during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. First, smaller dirlik units, that
is the timars, were converted into mukataah status. Gradually, larger units devoted to
the financing of higher military and administrative positions {has and zeamet) were
brought under the mukataa system. More importantly, the duration of the mukataa
arrangements was slowly expanded to cover longer time periods. Finally, in 1695, the
government began to allow the holding of the mukataas for the lifetime of the
leaseholder. The lands held by this long-term arrangement was called malikane
mukataa. In the malikane system, the leaser o f the right to collect the taxes due on a
specific land or area {mukataa) on a life-time basis paid an up-front lump sum amount,
and, in addition, pledged to pay a certain fixed cash amount to the treasury annually. In
return, the ‘owner* o f the malikane acquired the right to collect revenue within the
territory in question during his lifetime. Thus, the malikane mukataa holder emerged as
the collector o f taxes and rent on miri lands in return for a fee.27 Legally speaking, the
state still held the rights of plain ownership {rakabe) over the malikane, but the long
term nature of his lease and ability o f the lessee to negotiate the passing of the mukataa
to his heirs under similar terms blurred the differences between purely state-contracted
rights and outright ownership in practice.28
By the end of the eighteenth century, the mukataa system had expanded
considerably. The standard malikane practice was now quite common throughout the
empire and constituted an important source of regular cash flow into the imperial
treasury. In addition, the government adopted certain methods that helped expand the
mukataa system on a broader social basis. For instance, the treasury introduced the
practice o f issuing chits or shares {esham) against the tax revenue, or rather the net
future profits, expected from mukataah miri lands with a view to attract smaller
investors to tax farming and raise the necessary capital to finance the mounting

budgetary deficits.29 Although these practices secured the flow o f cash revenues directly
into the treasury and enabled the central state to meet its expenses, the mukataa system,
fell short of resolving the fiscal crisis of the central government, for it led to the
appropriation of agrarian surplus by local agents at the expense of the central treasury.
Yet, the eighteenth century also witnessed the diffusion of state authority in the
provinces and the realignment of Ottoman finances. In this sense, it is possible to argue
that the new fiscal arrangements/system suited not only the emergent financial
requirements of the state but also its internal political realities.30
This process of fiscal and political realignment was accompanied by an
expansion of the relatively ‘autonomous’ socio-economic domain accommodated by the
miilk and vakif properties. The acquisition of miilk property through §er 7 sales, as well
as through land reclamations, and the subsequent endowment of such property to vakifs
appear to have been particularly important in this respect.31
The structural impact of the conversion of newly acquired miilk property into
vakif status was twofold. On the one hand, the vakifs provided the local power magnates
with an ideal source o f rent income that was inviolable, inalienable and that brought
considerable fiscal advantages to the endower. Thus, the vakifs helped consolidate the
financial profile o f the local power magnates and contributed to the ‘primitive
accumulation’ of capital through systematic appropriation and marketing of the
economic surplus generated within the vakif domain. On the other hand, the vakifs also
strengthened the prestige of the local power magnates. The welfare functions and public

services provided by the vakifs often signified the endowers’ influence and helped
consolidate their power.32
The emergence o f tax farming, or more specifically the malikane system, as the
dominant form of revenue collection restructured and transformed land tenure and
surplus appropriation relations over miri lands. The long tenure of the tax farmer over a
given mukataa enabled him to establish a dominant position over the cultivators of the
land. The latter became rent-payers liable to the tax farmer. In other words, the
malikane mukataa system obscured the tenancy relation between the state and the
raiyyet, and practically replaced it with a tenancy relation o f a private nature set
between the tax farmer and the occupier of the land. Thus, within the malikane
mukataas, the tax farmer emerged as a rent collector, or the appropriator of the
economic surplus generated within the mukataa area. The holder o f the malikane came
close to acquiring the status o f a ‘proprietor’ cum landlord.33 More importantly, certain
prominent individuals used their influence and position to obtain, from Istanbul, the
necessary permission to convert parts of their malikanes into private estates, which they
subsequently endowed as vakifs. Such practices enabled certain local power magnates
(ayan) to amass considerable economic power and to enhance their political influence
within their respective territories, especially in the eighteenth century.34
The emergence o f the local ayan as a powerful group did not necessarily imply
the immediate loss of government control over the provinces; nor did it mean automatic
de-centralisation. Indeed, many ayan remained loyal to the central authority and served
as active agents of central government throughout the provinces.35 However, others

worked against the authority of Istanbul. In the existing literature, it is not yet exactly
clear what led some ayan into insurgence, while others simply chose to cooperate with
and remain loyal to the central authority. However, what the government could deliver
to the local elite, both politically and economically, appears to have made the critical
difference in the ayan's decision between compliance and insurgence. In this context, it
is interesting to note that the ayan in such areas as Egypt and Rumelia that had
considerable economic potential and solid links to the emerging ‘world economy’
managed to seriously challenge the authority of Istanbul. Yet, other, more contingent,
political and even diplomatic factors played an important role in the ebbs and flows of
power relations between the centre and the provincial ayan in the eighteenth century.
During the reign of Mahmud II (1808-1839) and the early years of the Tanzimat
period (1839-1876), radical measures were taken to exert the authority of the central
government over the provinces in a more direct and effective manner. The central
government organised a series o f military campaigns to eliminate the sway of the
insurgent provincial magnates. In some instances, the state reclaimed the landed
property held by the ayan in the form of malikanes in order to curb the ayan's economic
and political power. The leaders of some prominent ayan families were appointed to
distant locations as governors and officers. In addition, the long defunct dirlikltimar
system was abolished and the associated miri lands were brought under the direct
control of the public treasury.36
The internal political and military turmoil that accompanied the liquidation of
malikanes and o f certain vakifs brought about considerable confusion over land matters
and taxation. The reformers of the Tanzimat era paid due attention to issues of
landownership and property rights and took a series of administrative and legislative
measures that would help reinstate state control over land-matters and bring some order
to fiscal matters. These measures included the enactment o f special laws that regulated
the administration o f vakifs, the use of agricultural lands, the acquisition of title deeds,
the inheritance o f landed property and collaterals in the 1840s and the 1850s.37

Tanzimat period was the 1858 Land Law. A thorough analysis of the 1858 Land Law
shall not detain us here. But, it is important to discuss certain important features of the
Land Law in order to clarify our technical discussion o f property rights.
The 1858 Land Law remained largely true to the word and the spirit of the
classical Ottoman laws (kanuns) pertaining to land matters and introduced certain
complementary but important principles that helped clarify some of the complex legal
issues at hand. In this context, the 1858 Land Law attempted to reassert the supreme
custodianship o f the state over miri lands and, clause after clause, elucidated the specific
rights and obligations o f the title deed holders.38
As in the classical land regime, the state retained the plain ownership (rakabe) of
the miri lands and granted the exclusive right of usufruct (tasarruf) to actual cultivators,
conditional upon the exchange of the old title deeds in their hands with a new certificate
of tenancy, also called tapu, at the local government offices.39 This principle of re
registration was important in order to clarify the confusion prevailing over the rights of
proprietorship associated with miri lands. This measure, as signified in the tapu concept,
confirmed the state’s plain ownership over miri lands and defined the central
government, once again, as the ultimate authority that could establish and confirm

proprietary rights over miri lands. The same measure also secured the integrity of the
legal rights held by the possessor of the title deed. The possession of the tapu certificate
simply signified the possessor’s legal claim to proprietorship over miri lands on a
legally enforceable basis. This aspect of the Land Law was of crucial importance, as it
defined property rights as a legal category signified by the possession of the tapu deed.
That is, no other legal condition, such as the obligation to pay certain §er 7 and
customary taxes etc., could signify the proprietary rights o f the title deed holder over
miri lands, with the same degree o f certainty, as did the title deed. In this sense, the
1858 Land Law helped clarify matters pertaining to the ownership and use of miri lands,
and, ceteris paribus, facilitated the implementation and enforcement of the law.
Given the importance o f the tapu, the legal framework that regulated the actual
acquisition o f the title deeds was of prime importance for the consolidation of the
proprietary rights held by the title deed holders. The 1858 Land Law primarily adopted
the principle of individual 'ownership' (ferdi tasarruf hakki) over miri lands and
required the registration of title deeds on an individual basis for each village household.
Accordingly, Article 8 forbade collective landholding and Articles 130 and 131
prohibited the acquisition of the lands of an entire (occupied) village by a few
individuals.40 Thus, the Land Law openly gave priority to the acquisition of the title
deeds by the actual possessors cum cultivators of the land, or the reaya as such.
However, certain clauses o f the law, also implicitly allowed collective
landholding and the acquisition o f title deeds for large tracts of land by individual
parties. For instance, Articles 15-18 o f the Land Law practically allowed collective, or
rather shared (bi 7 i$tirak), ownership over miri lands.41 Article 78 stipulated that
anyone who brought miri land under cultivation for more than ten years without a legal
permit could acquire a title deed to that land upon the payment of the due registration
fee. Also, a person who had practically occupied abandoned (mahlul) land for over ten
years and had kept it under cultivation during this period could acquire the title deeds
freely even if s/he did not have a legal permit to start with. Should there be conflicting
claims thereof, however, the occupier could still obtain a deed upon the individual’s
acceptance and confession to his/her unlawful act, the settlement of the conflict and the

192


payment of the registration fee.42 Likewise, any individual who put dead mevat land into
productive use could acquire the tapu certificate and assume full rights of possession
and usufruct as stipulated by the law 43
It is important to note that the practice of granting tapu deeds to persons who
had reclaimed or ‘vivified’ mevat lands deviated from the classical practice of granting
such lands as miilk property to the persons in question. As we have seen, the mevat
lands previously had been associated, albeit indirectly, with the relatively “autonomous”
socio-economic domain o f the miilk and vakif categories. However, the 1858 Land Law
established a careful association between mevat and miri categories and thus implicitly
extended state ownership into the domain of mevat lands. This deviation form the
classical practice underscores the state’s concern with consolidating its control over
land matters. In fact, the state’s immediate concern was to clarify the legal status of
landed property and to deepen state control therein, rather than a straightforward and a
priori commitment to the preservation o f the proprietary rights o f the reaya. Quataert
points out that the 1858 Land Law helped legalise and confirm patterns of landholding
within the miri/mevat domain. Existing research on the actual registration of title deeds
supports Quataert’s view and depicts a highly diverse picture whereby both the reaya
and prominent individuals in possession of large tracts of land registered the land in
their name and acquired title deeds. Local power balance, traditions and other more
contingent political factors seem to have played an important role in the registration
process and the subsequent acquisition of the title deeds by private parties.44
Despite important organisational and institutional drawbacks, the
aforementioned developments contributed to the consolidation of the proprietary rights
of title deed holders. The inadequacies of provincial administrations and the justice

system; simple incompetence of some government officers and judicial staff, and
corruption in government offices seem to have compromised the efficacy of the legal
and administrative measures, particularly during the crucial transitionary years of the
Tanzimat era.45 Later in. the Hamidian period, the improvements in provincial
administration seemingly helped overcome some of the difficulties encountered in the
previous years 46 Also, the land surveys undertaken by the authorities seem to have
further improved the situation in favour of the title-holder (see below). It is my
impression that most of the disputes over land ‘ownership* were settled and most
individuals in possession of miri lands came to hold a tapu whether through surveys,
corrupt practices, brutal force or by way of legal action by the mid-1890s. As we shall
see in the case of Selanik, the disputes during this later period were largely over the
violation of rights held by individuals. Proof of proprietorship, to the best o f my
knowledge, was hardly a serious and inconsolable matter. The litigants could normally
prove their ownership status before the courts and other government offices. Local
governments and judicial authorities systematically decided in favour of those who
could prove, beyond reasonable doubt, their ownership status and enforced the law to
their best capacity. In this respect, proof of ownership, that is the possession of a tapu
certificate, now constituted an important source of power. In the case o f those
individuals who managed to acquire tapus for sufficiently large miri territory, these
documents also allowed holders to appropriate the economic surplus generated within

the miri lands on a legally enforceable basis. The tapu concept as set by the 1858 Land
Law constituted the legal basis of this empowerment.
The 1858 Land Law and the supplementary legislation enacted during the 1860s
and 1870s brought about important relaxations over the acquisition and transfer of miri
property. As we have seen, the classical land regime put important restrictions on the
transfer o f miri lands. At first, the 1858 Land Law adopted similar restrictive principles
in regulating the transfer of miri property. However, subsequent legislation introduced
important relaxations in transactions, especially in those related to sales, mortgage,
collaterals, leases and inheritance.
Sale, Mortgage and Collateral: According to the 1858 Land Law, the title-deed
holders could not fully and directly exercise certain rights associated with the plain
ownership (rakabe) o f the land. For instance, the title-deed holders could not sell the
land. They could transfer (ferag) their title deeds to a third party but only with the
permission o f the local authorities.47 Similarly, the creditors could not get miri lands
sequestered as a result o f the title-deed holders' failure to pay his/her outstanding debts,
because technically the land was not the property of the title-deed holder. Upon the
death o f the title deed holder the debts would simply accrue to his/her heirs. If no heirs
could be found, then the land could be “sold”, or more appropriately re-assigned, to
others by the state.48 By the same token, the miri lands could not be held as collateral.
However, the law allowed die title deed holder to relinquish his/her rights to creditors in
trust (yefaen ferag). In this case, the creditors would “withhold” (hapis) the title to the
land and the title-deed holder could not reclaim his rights without the full repayment of
the debt49 If the title-deed holder failed to pay the outstanding debts in his/her lifetime
and if his/her heirs could not pay them either, then the title deeds would remain
practically “withheld” by the creditors or their heirs, providing them the right to reclaim
the debt in the event that the land was auctioned for reassignment by the government
authorities. The proceeds from the auction would go to the creditors primarily, after the
deduction of a certain fee (commission) by the state.50

Although these regulations allowed the transfer of miri lands and theoretically
enabled the title-deed holder to show it as collateral against debt and other liabilities, the
regulations were still quite restrictive. For instance, the existing legislation practically
barred the title deed holders from access to credit markets on favourable terms and
discouraged creditors from extending long-term credits to farmers, due mainly to the
technical complications and the long-term risks associated with the practice of ‘vefaen
ferag’ and “land capture” {hapis). In this respect, the 1858 Land Law, fell short of
meeting the specific needs o f the rapidly growing commercial economy, for it did not
allow land to become fully commodified, not yet.
In the 1860s and the 1870s, however, the Ottoman government enacted
supplementary legislation that largely liberalised the transactions related to mortgages
and collaterals. First, the restrictions on the sale of miri lands to pay the outstanding
debts of the title-deed holder were removed. Two pieces of legislation promulgated in
1861 allowed the sale o f property against the debt owed to the state during the lifetime
of the title deed holder. In 1869, new legislation endorsed the sale of title deeds for the
payment o f all private debts during the lifetime of the title holder. In 1872, the scope of
this legislation was extended further to hold the heirs of the title deed holder
accountable for the payment of outstanding debts owed to the state. In 1911, the existing
legislation was adjusted to include debt to private parties as well.51
Similar modifications eased the technical difficulties encountered in using land
as collateral. A regulation enacted in 1869 made the sale of the title deeds of an
indebted individual compulsory upon his/her death even if s/he had heirs. This
legislation was important as it provided the,creditor’s the vague, if not impractical, right
to ’’withhold” the title deed o f the debtor with enforceability. According to Barkan, this
legislation closely approximated the practice o f vefaen ferag to an absolute collateral
{katiferag).52
Lease: Previously, the title-deed holder could not independently lease the miri
land in his possession to a third party. The 1858 Land Law expanded the usufruct rights
held by the title deed holders and granted them the exclusive right to use and benefit

196


from the miri land in their possession. Thus, Article 23 openly allowed leases.53 Articles
10 and 14 secured the ultimate proprietary rights of the title-deed holder against third
parties and stipulated that no other person could cultivate or benefit in any other way
from the land without the permission of the title-deed holder. If such an unlawful act did
occur, the title-deed holder retained the right to have the perpetrators expelled by due
legal action.54
Inheritance: The classical land regime put important restrictions over the
inheritance o f miri property. Prior to the enactment of the 1858 Land Law, Ottoman
legislation recognised only the sons and daughters of the title deed holder as legal
heirs.55 If no such heirs could be identified, the property would then accrue to the public
treasury (beyt-iil mat), which would then reassign the land to a third party as stipulated
by the law. The close relatives o f the deceased, such as the partners, parents and the
siblings had to make, like any other legal party, the necessary down payment (hedel-i
menfaat) to acquire the title deed. In this respect, the old Ottoman legislation defined
inheritance rights on a narrow basis for miri lands in comparison to freehold miilk
property, which, as we have seen, could be inherited, without any extra cost, by close
relatives (asabe) o f the malik.
The 1858 Land Law extended the right of inheritance on miri lands quite
considerably and recognised the parents, as well as the children, of the deceased as legal
heirs.56 Supplementary legislation enacted in 1867 allowed the inheritance of title deeds
also by the siblings, spouses and grandchildren of the title-deed holders.57 Thus, by the
1870s, the laws governing the inheritance of miri property approximated quite closely
those that regulated the inheritance of freehold miilk and vafo/property.
The consolidation of the proprietary rights over miri lands and the liberalisation
of transactions related to sales, mortgages, collaterals, leases and inheritances involving
miri lands had important economic repercussions. First, the liberalisation of these
transactions brought the proprietorship o f miri land close to freehold status. Secondly,

the land legislation allowed the near complete commodification of land as a primary
factor of production. These two consequential developments serve as a key to
understanding the underlining dynamics of agrarian transformation, during the
Hamidian era. The implication of the legal measures for a) the commercialisation of
agriculture, b) the structuration of land and credit markets, and c) the transformation of.
the relations o f production in agriculture is particularly important to note.
a) Consolidation of property rights meant first and foremost that the proprietors
could exercise their “ownership” rights freely, subject only to minor regulations and
usual fiscal obligations. They could exclude all other parties from interfering with the
production process and from violating the property in a way that would undermine the
proprietors' capacity to fully benefit from it. Besides, the extension of the rights of
inheritance practically prevented the return of miri property to the public treasury (beyt
til mat) upon the death of the proprietor and thus secured the continuity of ownership
within the broader family unit.
These liberties and privileges in ownership must have, ceteris paribus,
constituted a strong incentive for the proprietors to respond to market forces, increase.
production, and to invest in the property.58 Hence, the land legislation, in its broad
structural sense, seems to have articulated well with the ongoing commercialisation
process in agriculture. In this respect, we can consider the Ottoman government as an
important agent of commercialisation and integration with the capitalist world economy,
particularly during the Hamidian era.
b) The increasing commodification of land allowed the establishment of a solid
structural link between land and credit markets. Theoretically speaking, the
liberalisation o f the mortgage o f land and of its use as collateral helped reduce
“transaction costs” in land and credit markets and rendered transactions easier and more
definitive for all the parties involved. The new legislation also enabled the proprietors to
have direct access to credit markets, especially for long-term loans. Indeed, thousands
of farmers were able to receive credit on favourable terms from public credit
institutions, particularly from the Agricultural Bank, showing their miri “property” as
collateral during the Hamidian period. Similarly, transactions in private credit markets
expanded notably, following the liberalisation of regulations that governed collaterals
198


and mortgages. Many private banks, individual bankers and usurers extended credits to
land owners quite liberally during the same period. Although some of the credit thus
obtained could not always be put to productive use, such financial arrangements
nevertheless enhanced the flexibility o f the agrarian economy at large.59 In this respect,
the increasing commodification of land articulated firmly the moment of
commercialisation and of the spread of modem capitalist relations in the countryside.
c) The commodification of land and the consolidation of property rights also had
important repercussions for the restructuring of the relations of production in
agriculture. Firstly, the commodification of land increased the title deed holders’ risk of
dispossession and thus added to their insecurity. Indeed, many proprietors lost their
entitlement to land under distressing mortgages and became tenants on the lands they
once held in ownership in almost all parts of the empire during the Hamidian era. Other
dispossessed farmers left for urban areas and joined the ranks of the urban working
classes and provided the necessary cheap labour power for the growing urban sectors.
Such dynamics o f dislocation reflected the cmel face of the ongoing “modernisation”
process. However, these dislocations also helped accelerate the rise of a “market
society” in Ottoman lands.60
Secondly, the liberalisation o f leases contributed to the liberalisation of tenancy
relations over all miri lands. Now, the title deed holder could become a rentier landlord
over miri property. The exclusiveness of the rights of usufruct empowered the title deed
holder with the capacity to appropriate the surplus generated within the miri property on
a legally enforceable basis. In this respect, the land legislation seems to have allowed
the primitive accumulation o f capital in Ottoman lands. However, the surplus
appropriated by the landlords rarely found its way to productive ends. Intense
competition in both overseas and domestic markets increased the risks associated with
such productive investments. In addition, high transaction costs emanating from certain
institutional inadequacies prevented proprietors from undertaking investment in key

productive sectors o f the economy, especially in agriculture.61 Under the circumstances,
the Duesenberry effect absorbed the income accruing to the landlords and they spent
their money to finance the lavish life styles they led in towns.62 In some instances, the
proprietors invested considerable sums into real estate development, particularly in the
growing urban areas.63 However, the proprietors appear to have invested the bulk of
their capital into usury practices and financial arbitrage, both within the empire and in
European money and stock markets.64 The chronic financial insolvency of the Ottoman
state also created ample opportunities for these people of economic means profit
considerably from extending short-term credits to the government. The most common
form of such lending was tax farming. In order to understand the logic of this usury
practice we should consider briefly the systems of taxation that prevailed throughout the
empire during the period under consideration.
From the early years of the Tanzimat period onwards, the central government
attempted to centralise taxation practices and tried to put the sources of tax revenue
under the responsibility of appointed governors and officers. The central government
abolished the practice o f tax fanning in 1840/1841 and commissioned salaried officers
for the collection of tithes in the provinces.. However, this practice (emaneten idare) led
to significant reaction and confusion over the collection of taxes and gave way to a
notable contraction in government revenue. The appointed tax collectors were often
forced into isolation and encountered immense difficulties in collecting the taxes and in
converting the in-kind tax payments into cash, before forwarding the due amount to
61 See Chapters 2 and 3 for the institutional factors that impaired the development of agricultural sector.
62 The Dusenberry effect can be summarised as follows: “even if per capita incomes in backward regions rise ... any potentially favourable impact on savings will be annihilated by an increase' in the propensity to consume as people in these regions try to catch up with the consumption standards prevalent in the industrially advanced countries”.

Istanbul. The failure o f the practice of direct tax collection inevitably compelled the
government to revert to the practice o f tax farming in 1843-1844.65
The authorities nevertheless tried to impose tighter controls over the tax farmers
and took certain measures to improve the system of tax collection in favour of the
central treasury and o f the cultivators, who suffered immensely in the hands of tax
farmers. The efforts had only limited success, and the predominance of local agents in
fiscal processes went largely unchallenged until the end of the Tanzimat period.
Provincial notables (e§raj), powerful merchants and usurers especially managed to
capture commanding positions in tax farming auctions either through influence or the
sheer use o f the financial power at their disposal.66
During the early years o f the Hamidian era, the authorities systematically tried to
impose tighter controls over the tax collection processes. They attempted to introduce
more effective methods o f direct tax collection; to replace the proportional tithe with a
fixed land tax; to contract the due taxes collectively to villagers themselves, rather than
to tax farmers; to impose tighter controls on the activities o f tax farmers; and to increase
the competitiveness and fairness o f tax-farm auctions. The efforts of the central
government were only partially successful. At times and in certain parts of the empire,
the power and influence of local agents simply proved impermeable, and the practice of
tax farming continued to be the dominant form of revenue collection. This was the case
especially in Eastern Anatolia and the Arab lands, where local notables, sheikhs and
other feudal lords still reigned supreme.67 In more central areas, that is in the Rumelian
and Anatolian provinces, administrative inadequacies and corrupt practices
compromised the effectiveness and applicability of the decrees and regulations
promulgated by the central government. Besides, the sustained price depression of the
1880s and the 1890s abated the attraction of tax farming and many risk averse tax
farmers shied away from auctions. Under the circumstances, a few tax farmers with

considerable economic power and local influence dominated auctions and acquired
privileges in taxation at exorbitantly low prices at the expense of the central treasury.68
The efforts of the central government apparently yielded more significant results
only towards the end o f the Hamidian era. Arguably, the most significant quantitative
indicator of the government’s increasing capacity in revenue collection is the proportion
of the actual tithe receipts {tahsilat) to the expected total tithe revenues (tahakkukat).
According to Shaw’s figures, the ratio of tahsilat to tahakkukat rose steadily from about
72% in the late 1890s to 84% in the early 1910s.69 A number of administrative and
economic reasons seem to have underlined this improvement in the efficiency o f tithe
collection. The establishment of more comprehensive systems of local government
seem to have contributed significantly to the government’s capacity to collect taxes,
especially in commercially developed, central, and rail-linked areas of the empire. Also,
the control of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration (PDA) over the collection and
management o f an increasing share o f the tithe revenues in certain districts seems to
have helped improve the overall efficacy of tax farming. Finally, the recovery in
agricultural prices seems to have increased the attraction of tax farming, particularly for
smaller investors. Hence, higher bids for tax-farms, less tax in arrears, and a better
approximation o f the actual to the expected revenues became possible.70
Whatever the improvements in the government’s capacity to impose tighter
controls on tax farming may have been, the practice still remained the primary means of
tithe collection throughout the empire. About 90-95% o f the provincial tithe revenue
was collected by means o f tax farming during the Hamidian era.71 The persistence of tax
farming was consequential. First, certain aspects of tax farming, which we shall discuss
in greater detail in the next section, had regressive effects on agriculture and put peasant
farmers under economic distress. Secondly, tax farming was a lucrative means of
income generation from which the investors could expect to earn up to 30% in profits,
depending on the economic conjuncture, the market position of the tax farmer, and his

capacity to extract surplus from the taxpayers.72 At no point in the nineteenth century
did an investment yield such high returns. Thus, tax farming, together with landlordism,
emerged as the primary rentier activity, especially if the investor was a person of local
prominence and influence.
Overall, the metamorphosis and restructuring o f the land regime and systems of
taxation had important implications for the transformation of the Ottoman economy
during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. These developments were in
line with the moment of capitalist incorporation and underscored the consolidation of a
highly commercialised economy with considerable potential for primitive accumulation
and long-term capitalist transformation. In this broad process, landlords, tax farmers,
merchants and usurers, who appropriated and/or marketed the rural surplus, acted as the
active agents of the ongoing commercialisation process.73 However, commercialisation
did not immediately translate into processes o f modernisation and full-blown capitalist
transformation. The attractiveness of usury practices and financial arbitrage undermined
the valorisation of capital and withheld agents from investing into agriculture and
manufacturing Also, the desire and ambition to lead opulent (urban) lifestyles
intensified the problem o f underinvestment in key sectors o f the agricultural economy.
Under the circumstances,, the development of modem sectors as well as agriculture
remained limited, and the Ottoman economy lagged seriously behind its contemporaries
in Europe as well as in Asia and the Americas.74 Meanwhile, the insecurities of the
Ottoman population and their exposure to market risks became greater than ever before.
Many farmers lost their entitlement to land under unfavourable market conditions and
became tenants over the lands they once held in “ownership”.75 Others sought their
fortunes elsewhere in urban areas and overseas.76 This process of displacement amid
commercialisation marks the emergence o f a “market society” in Ottoman lands. We
now turn to the manifestation of this process in the Selanik region.

2.1. Thd Consolidation of Property Rights: Registration, Deliverance of Justice and Law Enforcement
The registration o f the title deeds proceeded steadily in Selanik during the
Tanzimat and Hamidian periods. During the Tanzimat era, the authorities took a number
of important administrative measures that would bring some order to cadastral records
and secure the more systematic registration of the title deeds. First step taken in this
direction was probably the fiscal surveys carried out by the Ottoman government during
the early 1840s. These surveys were primarily intended to bring some order to the
payment o f property and income taxes. The records were kept in quite a detailed manner
and the authorities registered the precise nature, the basic characteristics and the value
of the real estate held by individuals in almost all provinces of the empire. Selanik was
included in this broader scheme. The local authorities registered the real property held
by individuals in the province.77 This early fiscal survey was a preliminary step to revise
and update the existing land as well as tax registers.78
Important administrative measures were also taken to register the title deeds and
to supervise land transactions on a regular basis during the last decade of the Tanzimat
period. Following the promulgation of the Law of Provincial Administration in 1864, an
imperial registry (Defter-i Hakani) was established to register all land transactions. In
the early 1870s, the Defter-i Hakani was further expanded to register land transactions
at a sub-provincial (sancak) level. In addition, special committees called the tahrir-i
emlak komisyonlari were set up to oversee the registration of title deeds in the sancaks.
Numerous government offices (emlak kalemi) were also established in the sub-districts
(kazas) to supervise and administer matters pertaining to real property on a regular

basis.79 Thus, a comprehensive and well-diffused regulatory bureaucratic system had
been instituted on the eve pf the Hamidian period.
The special committees (tahrir emlak komisyonlari) were particularly active
during the last years of the Tanzimat period. These committees began to register title
deeds and conducted land surveys throughout the region from the early 1870s
onwards.80 Apparently, the early efforts o f the committees and other government offices
failed to bring complete order to local registers. Disputes over the ownership of landed
property could still be seen. An example drawn from Ottoman and British archives
should illustrate the point.
In the early 1870s, a heated dispute arose between the heirs of a certain Hasib
Pa§a and the dragoman of the British Consulate in Salonica, Mr. Bizzo, concerning the
ownership of a certain estate (giftlik) named Citros located in the district of Karaferye.
Mr. Bizzo claimed that Citros was sold entirely to him by the deceased Hasib Pa§a.
However, the heirs o f Hasib Pa§a argued that their father held the estate in partnership
with Mr. Bizzo. Subsequently, the litigants were asked to provide the authorities with
conclusive proof o f ownership. The heirs of Hasib Pa§a failed to provide the tapu to the
court, but they insisted on their claims. Subsequently the local authorities carried out an
investigation into the local registers to determine the exact legal status of the estates
held by the heirs o f Hasib Pa§a. The authorities managed to confirm Hasib Pa§a's
ownership of sixteen estates in the district of Karaferye, but failed to find conclusive
evidence to confirm his ownership over twenty estates, which were currently held by his
heirs. Citros was among this latter group. In any case, the dispute between the heirs of
Hasib Pa§a and Mr. Bizzo could not be resolved for decades, hence causing
considerable upset for the British diplomats in Istanbul and Salonica. As late as 1904,
the appeals and the hearings were still continuing.81 The importance of this case is that it

Baker, Turkey, (New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1877), 397-398.

illustrates the continuing confusion over ownership o f landed property and points to the
feebleness of local land registers in the early 1870s.
More focused and systematic efforts were made to register the title deeds and to
update cadastral records came later in the 1870s and the 1880s. The bureaucratic
machine set up during the last decade of the Tanzimat era apparently served its purpose
well. It seems that the defteri hakani, the emlak tahrir komisyonlari and the emlak
kalemleri managed to supervise land transactions and brought some degree of order to
the land registers. In addition, the authorities carried out two more land surveys, one in
1878 and the other in 1886. These surveys facilitated the registration of the title deeds
on an extensive basis throughout the province. Finally, another land survey conducted in
1907 probably secured the near universal registration o f title deeds in the region.82
The proprietors themselves showed considerable interest in land registration and
assumed active initiative to acquire their tapu certificates from the local government
offices. As we have seen, the law provided the title deed holders with security of tenure
and granted them exclusive rights o f usufruct and possession on a legally enforceable
basis. This legal empowerment and the security provided by the law probably
constituted a strong incentive for the proprietors to register the land in their name and to
acquire their title deeds. A few examples from the districts of Razlik and Drama should
illustrate the point:
At some point during the early 1900s, eight villagers from Panya village in the
district of Razlik reclaimed land from the nearby woods and used it for a number of
years without registering the property. In 1909, the villagers applied for registration at
the local government offices. The local authorities initially showed some concern over
the use of the land without a legal permit for a number of years, but ultimately granted
the title deeds to the villagers, once the villagers proved that they had paid all due taxes
during the time o f their unlawful occupation.83 As such, the villagers managed to
legalise and consolidate their entitlement to land and could now enjoy all the legal
privileges that the law granted.

206


In another case, a certain Hiiseyin Pehlivan from the village of Rasovika in
Drama, applied for a title deed for the four donums o f land he had reclaimed from the
local woods. He argued that he had been in possession of this land for twenty three
years and that he was entitled to a tapu certificate in accordance with Article 78 of the
1858 Land Law, which granted title deeds to those cultivating a piece of land for more
than ten years without a valid permit. However, investigations carried out by the local
village council showed that Hiiseyin Pehlivan had been in possession of the land for.
only three years. Thus, Hiiseyin Pehlivan could not acquire the title deed he sought.84
Yet, the case shows the growing interest of the land holders in registering their lands,
obtaining title deeds, and thus legalising their claims to “ownership”. The desire of
Hiiseyin Pehlivan to register the land in his name and his knowledge o f the due legal
procedure is telling in this respect.
The actual implementation and enforcement o f the law was also imperative for
the consolidation o f the proprietary rights of title deed holders. The inadequacies of the
Ottoman justice system and law enforcement agencies are well known and need not be
reiterated here in great detail. It suffices to say that the corruption and incompetence of
judges, procedural complications and inconsistencies, overcrowded court rooms,
endless delays and appeals in legal proceedings, and the ineptitude of the provincial
security forces were among the causes of the poor administration of justice and law .
enforcement throughout the Tanzimat era.85 In addition, political and diplomatic
pressures frequently brought to bear upon the Ottoman courts undermined the
impartiality of court decisions and at times compelled the judges to prioritise the
interests o f certain prominent individuals over others. This appears to have been
particularly true for the legal cases involving the Civil List, certain high-ranking
officers, prominent notables, influential merchants and European citizens protected by
capitulary treaties. In short, the impartial and generic application and enforcement of the
law was compromised by the organisational, political, fiscal and, at times, diplomatic
feebleness of the Ottoman state in this early period.

Some o f these problems proved persistent during the Hamidian period as well.
Corruption still prevailed in courtrooms, and this weakness enabled certain powerful
individuals to exert pressure upon local courts and to influence the decision o f some
corrupt and opportunistic judges. Besides, the organisational inadequacies of the overall
legal system continued to impair the efficiency and the alacrity of the legal proceedings,
much to the disappointment and frustration of the litigants.86 Yet, the increasing
autonomy of the judicial organs; the regularisation and standardisation of the court
procedures; improvements in the hierarchical and bureaucratic organisation of the entire
justice system, and the appointment of much better trained graduates o f the newly
established Imperial Law School (Mekteb-i Hukuk-u §ahane) to the courts were all
important developments that helped improve the efficiency, fairness and the internal
consistency o f the overall legal system during the Hamidian period.87
In addition, the general improvement in the organisation and diffusion of the
security forces, especially that o f the rural gendarmerie, as well as the establishment of
telegraphic services and the construction of railways helped create a more effective
bureaucratic government organisation and presumably eased some o f the technical
difficulties encountered in the implementation and enforcement of the law.88
During my research in the Ottoman archives, I came across interesting legal
cases which indicate that the local authorities showed considerable sensitivity towards
the proprietary rights o f the title deed holders and managed to successfully enforce court
decisions, despite the complexity and political sensitivity o f the cases involved. These
cases are only illustrative and the full verification of the point I base on them requires in
depth research into local court registers. Still, the cases at hand point to the
unmistakable concern of the local authorities to honour the ownership rights of the title
deed holders and attest to the presence o f a comprehensive legal and bureaucratic
framework that was capable of delivering justice and enforcing the law. It is also
important to note in this context that I have not run into a legal case to the contrary, that
is a case wherein the authorities remained insensitive to a violation of the proprietary
rights held by landowners.

Yako Savol Modiyano, a prominent banker of Salonica, owned an estate {giftlik)
in the northern district of Gevgeli. He rented the estate to a lawyer named Mente§
Istromi. Mente§ administered the estate and forwarded the annual rent to Yako Savol
after retaining his share. In the early 1900s, Mente§ took Yako Modiyano to court,
arguing that the estate actually belonged to him and that Mr. Modiyano had acquired the
estate illegally. We do not know what prompted Mente§ to resort to such action, but he
seems to have put considerable pressure oil the judges of the nizamiye court in Gevgeli
in an effort to influence their decision. The local court was unable, and perhaps
unwilling, to resolve this delicate case and forwarded it to the higher court in Salonica.
Yako Savol presented the tapu certificate and the contract of tenancy signed with
Mente§ to the court in Salonica, whereupon the judge ruled in favour of Yako Savol.89
Another case involved the violation of a giftlik belonging to a certain colonel
(miralay) E§ref Bey by the tenants of a neighbouring giftlik owned by another local
notable, Salahaddin Bey. Salahaddin held that the vineyard in between the two estates
belonged to his giftlik. Possibly acting under Salahaddin's instructions, his tenants,
entered the vineyards in dispute and harvested the grapes without E§refs permission.
E§ref Bey notified the local authorities and brought legal action against the intruders.
The local authorities carried out an investigation into local land registers, and concluded
that the vineyards in question fell well within the borders o f E§refs estate and that they
clearly stood outside Salahaddin’s. E§ref was then asked to produce the title deeds as
proof of ownership at the court, which he did. Consequently, the local judge decided
that the intruding tenants had caused a damage o f O.L.lOO in E§refs property and
accordingly ordered Salahaddin to pay the full amount to E§ref as the guarantor (kefil)
of the tenants. The tenants remained in custody throughout the proceedings.90
In yet another case, the tenants of the giftliks of Viraste and Istavroz in Longaza
refused to pay their dues to the Greek (absentee) landlord and occupied the property
claiming that they were the actual proprietors of the land. However, the landlord applied,
to the local court and presented the judges his tapu certificate. The court ruled in favour
of the landlord, who subsequently called in twelve gendarmes from the local garrison to
expel the tenants. The tenants retaliated by burning the woods adjacent to the estate.

Subsequently, the landlord hired a dozen of armed guards (bekgis) to protect the estate
from the possible attacks of his former tenants and demanded further protection from
the local authorities.91
In another similar case, the Bulgarian tenants of a certain Akil Bey from Cuma-i
Bala went on “strike”, and refused to carry out their duties. Akil Bey was furious, as he
had paid the annual wages o f the tenants worth 2,330 kuru§QS in advance. He notified
the local authorities (kaymakamhk) in Cuma-i Bala and presented his tapu certificate
and the contract of tenancy. He demanded that the tenants be expelled from his property
instantly. The local authorities sent an officer escorted with a couple o f gendarmes to
the estate to carry out investigations. Some of the tenants complained that they did not
carry out the boycott o f their own will and were forced to do so upon the pressure of
Bulgarian bands operating in the region. They added that they had nothing personal
against Akil Bey and that they wanted to continue working in his estate. However, other
tenants were less complacent. They argued that they wanted to leave the estate, but
added that they could not do so in the middle of winter (January). They asked for the
permission of Akil Bey to stay in the estate until the end o f March. However, Akil Bey
insisted on the immediate deposition of those who did not accede to the terms of the
tenancy agreement and those who supported the Bulgarian bands. The local authorities
were somewhat reluctant to carry out the depositions and expressed some concern about
the political sensitivity o f the case. However, the governor of the district (kaymakam)
decided that Akil Bey was the proprietor (mutasarrif) of the estate and that he was
entitled to demand the removal o f the insurgent tenants. Accordingly, he ordered the
deposition of the tenants, although he added that due care should be taken during the
deposition not to aggravate the (political) situation further.92
In another case, the ownership rights of a Bulgarian landlord from Cuma-i Bala
were at stake. Sometime in the early 1900s, the military commander of the district, Salih
Pa§a, purchased an estate, which had been sequestered and subsequently auctioned by
the Agricultural Bank upon the failure of a Bulgarian landlord, Mi§a, to pay his debts to

the Bank.93 However, Salih Pa§a began to claim rent from the tenants occupying the
neighbouring estate still owned by Mi§a. At the time, Mi§a was in Bulgaria, so his
tenants informed Mi§a's father about the situation. Mi§a’s father took the case to the
local court and requested the termination of Salih Pa§a's “unlawful interference”. The
court carried out an investigation, which confirmed Mi§a's ownership of the land. A
subsequent court decision asked Salih Pa§a to withdraw from Mi§a’s property
immediately and to pay back the rent he had appropriated unlawfully from the tenants to
Mi§a. Salih Pa§a objected to the court's decision and argued that the tenants were trying
to avoid the payment of their dues and to force him out of his property.94 Unfortunately,
the available documentation does not reveal how the case was ultimately resolved. It is
quite unlikely that Salih Pa§a could win the case unless he proved Mi§a's title deed
wrong.
Certain common features of the cases cited above are important to note. In all
cases, the tapus and in some cases the local land registers were used systematically to
prove and confirm land ownership. Once the ownership status of the litigants was
established beyond reasonable doubt, the courts and the local authorities ruled strictly in
favour of the title deed holder. Also, the courts and local authorities applied the law
quite systematically, regardless o f the religious and the ethnic affiliation of the litigants
involved. Particularly, in the case o f Mi§a, the protection of the property rights of a
Bulgarian landlord in his absence against a Muslim landlord illustrates the generality
with which the law was applied by the courts. Finally, it is important to note the way in
which the law was enforced by the Ottoman authorities. In the case o f E§ref versus
Salahaddin, the local authorities held the intruding tenants under custody. Salahaddin
was probably obliged to pay the O.L.lOO in question promptly to E§ref so as to secure
the release of his tenants. In the cases involving the Greek landlord from Longaza and

The reasons behind the concerns o f the Bulgarian tenants become more apparent when we consider the following citation from Draganof: “In 1904 a Turkish society was founded at Kumonovo to dispossess the Christian proprietors. Several rich beys and the functionaries o f the agricultural bank were members of this society. The functionaries o f the bank illegally sold several landed estates belonging to Christians and mortgaged to the bank. Trai'co Stoianoff, Dimitri Christeff, and Spas Ilieff of the village of Mlado Nagoritchino, caza o f Kumanovo, saw the following properties sold before the expiry of the mortgages: The first, 50 dulums for a debt of £T 12.5;.the second, 60 dulums for a debt of £T 20, and the third, 40 dulums for a debt o f £T1. The purchasers o f these lands are Turks who have received title deeds after having paid off the mortgages. The Russian and Austrian consuls were acquainted with this circumstance”. See Draganof, Macedonia and Reforms, (London, 1908), 39.
211


Akil Bey from Cuma-i Bala, too, we witness the actual involvement of the local
gendarmerie forces to enforce the law.
Thus the legal cases above illustrate the authorities’ concern for maintaining the
integrity o f the title deed holders’ proprietary rights. By this time, the title deed holders
not only held exclusive and inviolable rights to use and benefit from their property, but
they also enjoyed the security and empowerment provided by the legal enforceability of
their rights. In other words, the legal entitlement to land became a real source o f social
and economic power for title deed holders. The crucial matter here is to determine the
exact socio-economic conditions under which proprietors could exercise this power. For
this, we need to discuss the land tenure relations that prevailed in the region during the
Hamidian era. This discussion should cast some light on the underlining dynamics of
commercialisation and economic dislocation in the regional economy.
2.2. The Peasant Proprietors, the Landlords and Their Tenants
2.2.1. Landholding Patterns
Small peasant proprietorship and estate ownership coexisted in Selanik during
the Hamidian period. It is difficult to determine the relative weight of these two forms
of landholding due to a lack o f published statistics and detailed research into cadastral
registers. Secondary sources often maintain that giftliks were particularly widespread
and constituted the predominant form of landholding in the region during the second
half o f the nineteenth century.95 This view is to a certain extent correct. As we shall see,
estates were indeed quite common in certain parts of the region. However, the
contention that the giftliks constituted the predominant form of landholding seems
somewhat illfounded. The problem emanates from the sources and the methodology
used in reaching this conclusion.
First, the historical evidence used to support this argument is flimsy. To our best
knowledge, the Ottoman government did not publish comprehensive statistics on
95 J. R Lampe, and M. R. Jackson, Balkan Economic History, 1550-1950, From Imperial Borderlands to Developing Nations, (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1982); B. Gounaris, Steam over Macedonia, 1870-1912, Socio-Economic Change and the Railway Factor, (New York: East European Monographs, Boulder, Distributed by Columbia University Press, 1993); Gounaris, Steam over
212


landholding. In the lack of official statistics, most contemporary observers contrived
estimates an ad hoc manner. For instance, the oft-cited estimate of the British consul
Wilkinson, which suggested that the giftliks accounted for about 60% of all the land
under cultivation in the province o f Selanik in the late 1860s, was probably not based on
reliable evidence.96 The estimates put forth by the Bulgarian historian Draganof appear
equally tenuous. Draganof suggests that over 75.0% of the arable land was held by
giftlik owners in the late 1900s.97
Secondly, there seems to be a tendency to make sweeping generalisations about
landholding patterns on the basis o f highly selective evidence that pertains to a limited
number of districts where giftliks were particularly common. The evidence put forth by
Lampe and Jackson on giftlik formation in the Macedonian provinces is a case in point.
According to their figures, about 41.7 to 77.5% o f all rural settlements in the districts of
Selanik, Menlik, Demirhisar and Petri? were giftliks in the mid-1870s. Thus, Lampe and
Jackson conclude that the giftliks constituted the predominant form o f landholding in
broader Macedonia.98 However, these (low-land/valley) districts were quite untypical
and had a particularly high concentration of giftliks for certain historical reasons.99
Similarly, the oft-cited British data published by Issawi is equally misleading. Issawi’s
figures suggest that about 40% o f all holdings were estates larger than 200 hectares in
the district (kaza) of Selanik during the early 1860s. Again, the district of Selanik was
one of the locations where giftliks were unusually common, and hence, the data
published by Issawi cannot be taken to represent the broader patterns o f landholding in
the region at large.100

96 Wilkinson seems to have based his estimates on a previous report sent to London. This report suggests that estates larger than 50 acres (200 donums) accounted for 60% o f all the land under cultivation in the district o f Selanik. The same report also maintains that estates larger than 75 acres (300 donums) surfaced 25% of all agricultural land in the district o f Drama. We do not know at all how the British consuls compiled this data. See, C. Issawi, The Economic History o f Turkey, 203. 97 Draganof, Macedonia and Reforms, 36. 98 Lampe and Jackson, Balkan Economic History, 136.
99 inalcik associates giftlik formation in European provinces with extensive land reclamations carried out by notables. See H. inalcik, “The Emergence o f Big Farms”; McGowan, Economic Life in Ottoman Europe', and, F. Adanir, “The Macedonian Question: the Socio-economic Reality and Problems o f its Historiographic Interpretation,” International Journal o f Turkish Studies, 3, N. 1, (1984/85): 43-64. For opposing views on fiflik formation see G. Veinstein, “On the Qiftlik Debate”, in Q. Keyder and F. Tabak (eds.), Landholding and Commercial Agriculture in the Middle East, (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1991), 35-56).

In the absence of reliable statistics, two proxies can help us delineate the
landholding patterns in the region, namely the ratio of households residing in giftliks to
all rural households and the share o f giftliks in all rural settlements. The first proxy can
be used to indicate, albeit tentatively, the probable weight of giftliks in overall
landholding, under the somewhat vague assumption that the land under cultivation in
giftliks and peasant villages, or karyes proper, would be a function of the number of
resident households. The second proxy, that is the share of giftliks in all rural
settlements, can give us important hints about the variations in landholding patterns in
the region.
The data on rural settlements can be extracted from the provincial yearbooks
(salnames). Almost all salnames contain information on the number of rural settlements
in Selanik, but only the yearbook o f 1896 includes detailed information on the number
of rural households residing in respective giftliks and peasant villages. Therefore, I
decided to use the 1896 salname to determine the patterns of landholding that prevailed
in the region during the mid-late 1890s. This data set is presented in Table 4.1.
According to them, 75.0% o f all rural settlements in the province included peasant
villages (karye) and the remaining 25.0% included giftliks. The peasant villages
accounted for a massive 89.0% of all the rural households in the province, while the
remaining 11.0% resided in giftliks. Although it is difficult to determine the precise
share of giftliks in actual landholding on the basis of this evidence, the sheer weight of
village households in total rural households suggest that small peasant proprietorship
was probably the primary, if not the dominant, form of landholding in Selanik during
the late nineteenth century. This point is also supported by the generally held contention
that the giftliks in the region were usually small and medium sized. Although some
estates could be well over 2,000 hectares, most giftliks varied between 100-500 hectares
and the average size o f giftliks stood somewhere between 300-350 hectares.101 If so,
given the sheer weight o f karyes and peasant households would suggest even more
strongly that small peasant proprietorship was the most typical form o f landholding in
the region.

The data presented in Table 4.1 also suggest considerable variation in
landholding patterns in the region. Qftlik concentration was particularly high in lowland
districts and along the valley stretches. For instance, the concentration of giftliks was
215


extremely high in the lowland districts of Selanik, Yenice, Karaferye, Vodine and
Katrin, which are situated over the Vardar plain and along the valley stretches of the
Incekara river basin in western Selanik. In these districts, 66.0% of all rural settlements
were giftliks and about 33.0% o f all rural households resided on giftliks. The giftliks
were also quite common in central and northern districts that stretched along the Vardar
and Karasu valleys, although it must be noted that peasant holdings assumed much
greater importance in central and northern districts in comparison to the low-land
districts o f the Vardar plain and the Incekara river basin. Qftliks were particularly
common in the plain/valley districts o f Avrethisar, Gevgeli, Tikve§ and Petri?. A quarter
o f all rural settlements in these four districts were giftliks and over 16.0% of all rural
households lived on giftliks.
Almost everywhere else, however, peasant villages {karyes) dominated the
countryside. Small peasant proprietorship was the dominant form o f landholding in
northern highland districts, in the mountainous southern peninsula and along the Siroz
Zihne-Drama-San §aban range. In the northern highland districts, peasant villages
accounted for 96% o f all rural settlements and 98% o f all rural households. Compared
to these highland districts, giftliks were relatively more common along the Siroz-Zihne
Drama-San §aban range. In Siroz, for instance, there were numerous large estates, some
of which could be as large as 20000-30000 donums (2000-3000 hectares).102 Still, small
peasant proprietorship constituted the predominant form of landholding in these
districts. About 85% of all rural settlements that were scattered along the Siroz-Zihne
Drama-San §aban range were peasant villages, and about 94% of all rural households
resided in karyes. Small peasant holdings were particularly predominant in leading
centres o f tobacco production. In Drama for instance, giftlik households constituted only
2% of the total. Unfortunately, household data is not available for the districts of Kavala
and San §aban, but considering the overwhelming weight of karyes in these districts,
we can suggest that small peasant holdings were dominant also in Kavala and San
§aban. Finally, small peasant proprietorship appears to have been the dominant form of
landholding also in the mountainous range that stretches southwards along the southern
peninsula.
102 por instance, 236 households resided in the giftlik o f Sarmisakli. Assuming that each, household worked on 100 donums (see Section 4.3), we can suggest that the size of Sarmisakli could have been over 23,000 donums (1312 S.V.S., 1895, 374).
216


The evidence presented above puts considerable doubt on the view that giftliks
constituted the dominant form of landholding in the region during the late nineteenth
century. Alternatively, the same evidence suggests that small peasant proprietorship was
probably much more important than that assumed in existing secondary sources. In this
context, the predominance o f small peasant proprietorship in cash crop producing
districts o f the Siroz-Zihne-Drama-Sari §aban range is particularly important to note.
This observation suggests that small peasant proprietors constituted the backbone of
commercial agriculture, which was the most dynamic component of the region's
agrarian economy during the period under consideration.103 Yet, the data presented
above also underline that the giftliks constituted an integral component of the regional
economy. In what follows, I will discuss the ‘ideal-type’ characteristics of the peasant
household economy and of the giftliks to highlight their relative weaknesses and
strengths. This discussion should shed some light on the dynamics of agrarian change,
growth, retardation and urbanisation in the Selanik region during the period under
consideration.
2.2.2. Peasant Household Economy
Small peasant proprietors were people of modest means. Peasant holdings were
quite small, rarely exceeding fifty donums. The best data on the size o f peasant holdings
are available from the 1907 agricultural statistics, which contain valuable and unique
information on the size o f peasant holdings in leading districts o f Selanik. These data
are presented in Table 4.2. According to the statistics, 32.0% of all rural households that
were engaged directly in agricultural production cultivated plots smaller than ten
donums and about 87.0% of them cultivated holdings smaller than 50 donums. The
households that worked on holdings larger than 50 donums constituted only 13.0% of
all rural households engaged in agricultural production. The official statistics suggest
that the average size o f all these holdings was around 13 donums. However, this average
figure might be an underestimation, as the official figures tend to somewhat understate
the area o f land under cultivation; hence, the average size of the “typical” peasant
103 s ee p Adanir, “Ottoman Peasantries, c.1360 - c.1860,” in T. Scott (edj The Peasantries o f Europe: From the Fourteenth to the Eighteenth Centuries, (London and New York: Longman), 269-310.
217


holding appears smaller than it actually was.104 Most contemporary sources often cite
20-30 donums as the average size of the “typical” peasant holding.105

Many peasant proprietors also owned small garden plots or vineyards attached to
their houses. These small plots were usually about 2-3 donums in size. The peasant
farmers grew vegetables, fruit trees and various legumes in these gardens for immediate

consumption within the household unit. The vineyards provided the grapes used to
produce wine, spirits, vinegar and grape syrup, all o f which were important items of
consumption for peasant families. They often marketed the surplus produce of the
gardens and vineyards ill the nearby towns and fairs and thus earned extra cash
income.106
The peasants were also engaged in animal husbandry. The animal inventory of
the “typical” peasant household included one or two oxen used mainly as draught
animals, a few cows, sheep or goats, pigs (in the case of Christian farmers) and
chickens. These animals were often kept in the bams attached to the house and the
livestock was raised in the communal pasture lands and the woods surrounding the
villages. The peasants consumed the milk, butter, cheese, skins and wool obtained from
these animals and also marketed some of their produce for extra cash income.107
The peasants relied on traditional technology and techniques o f production. The
farm implements were simple but practical, easy to maintain and cheap to replace.
Production methods were'conventional. Crop rotation was rarely practiced and lands
were left for fallow every second year round. Irrigated agriculture was largely limited,
and the farmers depended mainly on annual rainfall for the realisation of their crops.
The use o f fertilisers remained limited to the application of animal pest during the
fallow season.108
The family unit provided the main source of labour power in these small peasant
farms. Men and women worked the fields and the garden plots collectively, taking
responsibility for different tasks. Able-bodied men cultivated the fields, while women
and children contributed to the reaping of crops. Women also undertook housework,
attended to farm animals, spun yam, and wove cloth, carpets, rugs and blankets for
household consumption. The younger men, and sometimes the younger women, took up
seasonal employment on a regular basis. Men either worked in urban construction
industries or in giftliks as farm hands during the peak harvest season. Women took up
seasonal employment in tobacco processing and silk reeling industries and sometimes
doniims. See T. Giiran, 19. Yiizyil Osmanli Tarimi Uzerine Ara?tirmalar [Research on Nineteenth Century Ottoman Agriculture] (Istanbul: Eren Yaymcilik, 1998), 82. l0 6 P.P.A.P, 1870, V. 27: 304. 107 P P A .P , 1870, V. 27: 305.

worked as domestic servants in urban areas.109 Recourse to seasonal employment was
more common amongst highland villagers and peasants in possession of very small
holdings. Such practices probably remained relatively limited in cash crop producing
lowland districts, where the demand for labour power was relatively high due to the
labour-intensive nature o f cash crop production.
Small peasant proprietors did occasionally hire farm hands to ease the burden of
the family members during the harvest season. The employers provided food and shelter
for the agricultural workers, and the wages were normally paid in cash at the going
market rate. Such arrangements took place mainly in years when harvests were
particularly bountiful. Abrupt changes in the size o f the family unit triggered by
untimely deaths, departure of able bodied men for military service, and marriages might
have also prompted peasant proprietors to hire wage labourers on a seasonal basis. Yet,
contemporary sources suggest that such arrangements remained relatively limited and
the family unit normally served as the main source o f labour power in small peasant
farms.110
The quest for alternative sources of labour power was more apparent in larger
peasant holdings that could not be cultivated entirely by a single family. Relatively well
off peasant proprietors in possession of larger holdings, say over 50 donums, usually
rented parts o f their property to less fortunate peasant families residing in the same
village. The latter either held very small holdings or had become entirely dispossessed
for whatever reason.111 Recruitment of sharecroppers from outside the village
community was rare because of the tightness of rural labour markets, where the giftlik
owners keenly competed to recruit as many labourers as possible to be employed in
their estates (see below). It is not possible to determine how widespread these small
scale tenancy arrangements were, due to lack of conclusive evidence.
The peasant proprietors were subject to a number o f fiscal dues and obligations.
The most important o f the taxes paid by peasant proprietors were the tithe (a§ar) and the

animal taxes (agnam and canavar resmi). They also paid a number o f fixed taxes, which
included the road tax (yol vergisi), paid either in cash or in labour-services, and a
property tax (vergi). In addition, Muslim men were obliged to serve in the army.
Christian subjects were exempt from military service, but they had to pay a military
exemption tax (cizyefbedelat-i askeriye).112 Some proprietors also paid certain irregular
dues to rural guards and sometimes to armed bands and other local bandits for
“protection”, particularly in the highlands where banditry was more common.113 After
the payment of these taxes and dues, the peasants retained all the income accruing from
the marketing of their produce and from earnings acquired through by-employment and
seasonal work.
Overall, the peasant household economy stood on a tenuous balance between the
security o f self-sufficient production, the risks incurred from exposure to market
processes, the real burden of fiscal obligations and, last but not least, the natural and
climatic conditions to which they were exposed. The size and value of the marketable
surplus and the demand for the goods and services provided by the family units were
important determinants of the cash earnings that accrued to the family unit.
Unfavourable market trends and the lack of demand for the goods and services provided
by the family could seriously upset the cash flows. Also, dislocating shocks of harvest
failures, the untimely death of able-bodied men and women, absence during military
service and, perhaps more importantly, the death of draught animals could upset
seriously the precarious balance o f the household economy. In fact, such distressing
shocks constituted the weakest link in the broader organisation of the peasant economy
and could shake its foundations, namely labour power, draught-power and harvests. The
difficulty o f meeting financial obligations, particularly the payment of taxes and dues
collected in cash, could 'be very distressing for the peasant farmers. Yet, under
favourable economic conjunctures and benign climatic conditions, the peasants could
enjoy relative prosperity and security o f subsistence.

2.2.3. The Qiftlik Economy
The organisation of giftlik agriculture had certain built-in strengths and
weaknesses. Most giftliks in the region were owned by local Muslim notables (e§rqf),
influential government officials, prominent Christian and Jewish moneylenders and
merchants.114 Landowners typically resided in towns and either left the administration
of the giftliks to trusted bailiffs or sublet them to intermediaries in return for an annual
rent.
The giftliks were heavily dependent on labour power.115 The most common form
of labour procurement in the giftliks was sharecropping. Three forms of sharecropping
prevailed in the region, namely ortakgilik, kesmecilik and the recruitment of agricultural
workers (ter-oglans) on a yearly basis. In the first instance, the landlord provided the
tenant (<ortakgi) and his family with land, a cottage for shelter, a stable for the livestock
and a store room for the fodder. The landlord also supplied the seeds for sowing. In
return, the tenant farmer provided the labour power, the farm tools and the draft
animals. The produce was divided equally between the landlord and the tenant, after the
deduction of the tithe and the seed share necessary for next year's sowing. The straw
was usually kept by the tenants, but some close-fisted landlords chose to retain their
share o f the straw. The tenants were also responsible for conveying the landlord's share
of the crop to his grain store, which usually was located in the town where he normally
resided. In addition, the tenants provided the landlord with extra labour services. These
services included carting firewood from the hills, helping the landlord harvest the crops
in the fields spared for his subsistence needs and the maintenance and operation of the
mill usually owned by the landlord. The labour dues could reach up to a few hours
every week or about ten days a year. The tenants were not paid for this extra labour, but
the landlord often gave them small garden plots, about 2-3 donums in size, for which
they did not have to pay any rent. Landlords also allowed the tenants to graze their
livestock over estate pastures and to use the woods within to the estate. Aside from their
obligations to the giftlik owner, the tenants were also responsible for paying the same
taxes and fiscal dues claimed from independent peasant proprietors, except for the
Insurance Company’. They are not only higher in their charges for insurance, but even more cheeky and energetic than die typical insurance agent” (PRO, F.O. 195/1553, 14.4.1886, Groschen to Blunt). 114 Adamr “The Macedonian Question”; McGowan, Economic Life in Ottoman Empire.
The following discussion of different forms o f tenancy prevailing in the estates is based on the following sources: P.P.A.P., 1870, V. 27: 304; H. N. Brailsford, Macedonia, Its Races and Their
222


property tax (vergi), which was paid by the landlord. Ortakqilik constituted the most
common form o f sharecropping in the region during the period under consideration.
The second form of sharecropping was kesmecilik, which was quite similar to
ortakqilik. The main difference between the two practices was that the kesmeci tenant
stipulated a fixed quantity o f the crop, irrespective of the actual yield. The amount of
the fixed payment was agreed upon between the landlord and the kesmeci. The landlords
rarely preferred this form of tenancy agreement. Although bountiful harvests could be
advantageous for the landlord, bad harvest years were particularly detrimental and
could, at times, compel the landlord to pay the tenants more than the yield of that year's
harvest. Besides, many landlords found out many kesmeci tenants had little incentive to
work hard in order to improve the quality and quantity o f the harvest.
Finally, the landlords employed a third group o f sharecroppers (ter-oglans) in
their estates. The ter-oglans were often recruited from the lowest strata of the rural
populace and typically included dispossessed peasants who, unlike the ortakqis or
yaricis, had neither the oxen nor the farm implements they could bring into the
partnership. The ter-oglans were often employed on an annual basis and received a
combination of in-kind and cash payments in return for their services. The landlords
also provided basic shelter, farm implements, draught animals and seeds.116
Under all these sharecropping practices, the tenancy agreements were verbal,
although there is evidence to suggest that they became increasingly formalised towards
the end of the century.117 The tenancy agreements were normally renewed on a yearly
Future, (London, 1906); Draganof, Macedonia and Reforms', Pamuk, The Ottoman Empire; Pamuk, Osmanli Ekonomisinde Bagimhlik; Adamr, “The Macedonian Question”; Baker, Turkey.
116 According to the report of the British consul Calvert to Manastir, the ter oglans were employed under arrangements that varied considerably from one place to the other within the province. For instance, in one district, the ter oglans were paid 68.5-77.5 bushels o f Indian com and rye in equal proportions, and about 165 in cash for the entire year in the late 1860s. In another district, they only received 73 bushels of wheat. In a third district they got 45.5 bushels of rye, barley and millet mixed, 33.5 lbs. o f salt, 140 lbs. of leek and cabbages, half a raw ox-hide to make footwear for the family and cash wages that varied from 95 to 135 6d (P.P.A.P., 1870, V. 27: 304; also see Pamuk (1994: 203)). James Baker, a British officer who held an estate near Salonica during the late 1870s, mentions similar forms of payment, which included £10 and extra allowances o f grain and food amounting to £8 annually. Plus, the ter oglan and his family were given shelter. In another instance, the payment included two bushels of wheat, barley and rye each, plus a 15% share o f the crop after the deduction of the seed share and the tithe (Baker, Turkey, 400). Three decades later, the earnings of the ter oglans were still quite modest. According to Draganof, they received fixed annual wages that amounted to 80 to 100 bushels of grain (com, rye and maize mixed), 185 to 205 of cash, 5, to 8 pints o f petroleum and 10 okes (1,300 grs.) of haricots. 117 For a sample of a written tenancy agreement, see Draganof, Macedonia and Reforms, 45-46.
223


basis, although some arrangements could extend up to three to six years. At the end of
each term, usually in early March, a new agreement would be reached between the
tenant and the landlord. Each party was entitled to terminate the agreement unilaterally
at the end of the season. In that case, the tenants would leave the estate and the landlord
would employ new sharecroppers for the following year. However, if the tenants were
indebted to the landlord, they could not terminate the tenancy agreement until they fully
paid their debt. Most tenants were indebted heavily to the landlords, who willingly
extend credits at times o f economic distress (due to crop failures, death of draught
animals and the like). Many peasant farmers often failed to pay their outstanding debt to
the landlords. Therefore, they could not terminate the tenancy agreements and ended up
working on the estates for extended periods of time, sometimes indefinitely.
Indebtedness stands out as the main reason behind perpetual tenancy agreements.118
The landlords also employed seasonal wage labourers during peak harvest time.
These seasonal workers, both men and women, were often recruited from amongst
peasants coming from highlands in quest of extra cash earnings.119 The landlords
normally hired these workers to assist the sharecropping tenants during harvest time.120
Thus, sharecropping supported by seasonal wage-labour constituted the broad
framework for the organisation of the labour process in giftliks.
The organisation of the production process in the giftliks was quite similar to that
of the small peasant holdings. The tenant farmers mainly used the same technology and
methods o f production to cultivate the land and harvest the crops. However, the
introduction of new labour saving technology, such as light iron ploughs, mechanised
sieves and reapers, was relatively more common in the giftliks. Especially from the early
1900s onwards, the introduction of new technology proceeded much faster on gifliks,
owing mainly to growing labour shortages and the improvements in the technical and
logistic facilities that were imperative for the effective introduction and diffusion of
imported technologies.121

224


The giftliks normally specialised in labour-saving agricultural produce. The
scarcity o f labour in the region probably encouraged landlords to concentrate on cereal
production and especially on animal husbandry, which required relatively little labour
input. The income generated through the marketing of the annual surplus produce
probably constituted an important portion of the landlord's earnings accruing from the
giftlik. However, many landlords occasionally leased out the grazing grounds of the
giftlik and the fields left for fallow as winter pastures to flock-masters coming down
from the highlands. Some landlords also invested considerably in animal husbandry and
owned flocks o f their own and kept these animals on their estates the year round. The
meat and produce of these animals, nameiy dairy products, skins and wool, were
marketed in the rapidly growing urban areas and brought considerable earnings to giftlik
owners.
Labor dependency constituted the weakest point of the giftlik economy.
Dependency on labour power meant that the giftlik economy remained highly exposed
to the transformations taking place in regional labour markets. As we shall see, the
labour market constraint put giftlik owners into a very difficult situation and compelled
some of them to liquidate their estates and others to specialise in animal husbandry,
particularly after the turn o f the century.
3. Dynamics of Commercialisation, Rural Displacement and the Logic of Rent Seeking
3.1. Property Rights and Peasant Proprietors
Small peasant proprietors benefited from the consolidation of property rights.
The inviolability and the exclusiveness of property rights and security of tenure
provided by law underscored, ceteris paribus, the market responsiveness of small
peasant farmers and contributed to the rapid growth of commercial agriculture in the
region in important ways throughout the Hamidian era. During the late 1890s and the
early 1900s, the growth of cash crop production in leading centres of commercial
agriculture must be structurally associated with the consolidation o f property rights and
the security of tenure and property that was provided by the legal and institutional
framework discussed above. It is doubtful that the cultivators would have otherwise
responded to emergent market incentives with such vitality, because small peasant
225


proprietorship was still predominant in the region and this vulnerable segment of the
agrarian society would feel reluctant to alter their means of livelihood without sufficient
institutional and legal assurances.
The liberalisation of collaterals and mortgages had important implications for,
the small peasant proprietors. On the one hand, this development enabled them to access
credit markets on relatively easy terms. Although the peasants’ capacity to access public
credit markets was circumscribed by the predominance of landlords and cumbersome
application procedures, many farmers nevertheless received bank credits.122 This
situation enabled some small peasant proprietors to escape the extortion of usurers.
Therefore, in a broad sense, the liberalisation of collaterals and mortgages contributed to
the stability of the peasant household economy and assured its predominance in the
region at large during the period under consideration.
On the other hand, however, the liberalisation of collaterals and mortgages also
increased the risks of dispossession for the small peasant proprietors. Indeed, many
farmers were unable to pay their debt and eventually lost their property under
distressing economic conditions and a growing cycle o f indebtedness. Even farmers
who had managed to receive credits from the Agricultural Bank could fail to fulfil their
financial obligations and subsequently face sequestrations. Such processes o f rural
displacement can be observed best from the back page of the local daily, Asir, where
land transactions taking place in the province were reported regularly. Among these
pages, one comes across countless examples o f the dispossession and sequestration of
property following the debtors’ failure to meet financial obligations towards private
parties or the Agricultural Bank. Likewise, the Council of State (§uroyi Devlet)
documents in Istanbul archives contain hundreds of cases about farmers who failed to
pay their debt to the bank and lost their property.
A number o f factors and processes seem to have pushed peasant proprietors into
indebtedness and subsequent dispossession during the period under consideration. The
fiscal dues and fees collected from the rural population put peasant families under
constant economic strain and often forced them into indebtedness under adverse
economic conditions. In fact, contemporary sources often cite the (growing) fiscal
122 See Chapter 3.
226


burden o f the peasantry as an important, if not the primary reason, for indebtedness and
dispossession.123
Two factors appear to have increased the fiscal burden o f the peasantry. First,
the rise in the tithe rate by 20% in 1894 and by another 0.6% in 1900 increased
considerably the real tax-burden of the rural population. The rise in the tithe rate
reduced the cash income accruing to peasant families. Under the circumstances, families
found it more difficult to disburse such fiscal dues as animal taxes, the road tax,
property tax and the military exemption tax, which were to be paid in cash. Normally,
peasant families could have made up for the loss of (cash) income by taking up by
employment or seasonal work or by switching to the production of more lucrative crops.
In fact, many peasants did take up by-employment and seasonal jobs in rural and urban
areas during this period.124 Likewise, many took up the. production of more lucrative
cash crops during this period. However, the crop failures that afflicted the countryside
in the post-1895 period rendered the tax burden intolerable for small peasant
proprietors. The periods of 1897-1902 and 1906-1910 were unusually poor harvest
years for cereal producers. 1897-1898 and 1902-1904 were bad years for cotton
producers; the opium and poppy yields of 1905 and 1909 were either poor or below
average, and 1903-1904 and 1907-1911 were unusually disappointing for sesame
producers. Despite the successful crisis management schemes put into effect by the
Ottoman government, such persistent crop failures reduced the income of small peasant
proprietors quite substantially and put them under considerable financial strain. Many
farmers borrowed money from local usurers, as well as the Agricultural Bank in order to
meet their fiscal obligations and other expenses. Apparently, such credit arrangements
frequently ended in the sequestration o f property and eventual dispossession.
In some instances, the dispossessed peasants simply could not break through the
predicament of indebtedness, and they became tenants on lands they once owned. The
clearest manifestation of this process was the emergence o f “mixed villages”, where
some fields were cultivated by peasant farmers and others were tilled by the tenants of
one landlord or another.125 Clearly, the increasing commodification of land set the

institutional background for dispossession and the spread o f such petty tenancy relations
in the region during the period under consideration, particularly towards the end of the
Hamidian era.
Other dispossessed peasants, who could somehow break away from the fetters of
indebtedness and financial dependency, left the countryside and migrated either to urban
areas or abroad. A number of push and pull factors underlined these processes of
migration and emigration.
Extortions of tax farmers were another source of constant distress for the peasant
farmers. Despite repeated attempts by the Ottoman government to impose tighter
controls on tax fanning, the power o f the tax farmer largely went unchecked during the
period under consideration. The abuses and extortions o f tax farmers were incisive.
Through fraudulent practices and outright coercion, tax farmers could collect
considerably higher fiscal dues than the official tax rates. For instance, tax farmers often
overestimated the value and/or amount of the annual harvest in order to extract as much
surplus as possible from the taxpayers.126 Also, tax farmers refrained from making bids
forward before the realisation of the summer crops so as to secure a handsome margin
of profit and to avoid the adverse effects of probable crop failures. This meant that the
tax-farm auctions would take place only in August. Until then, the crops had to lie
harvested in the fields, waiting for a tax farmer to arrive on the scene to collect the due
tithe. Often, crops were left in the open, exposed to adverse weather conditions, attacks
of animals, and theft.127 This situation not only undermined the producers’ bargaining
power vis a vis the tax farmers, but it also reduced overall productivity and led to
revenue losses for both the farmers and the government alike. Sometimes, the frustrated
farmers harvested and marketed the crops before the arrival of the tax farmer. However,
doniims were owned by one landlord (Draganof, Macedonia and Reforms, 39). In the village of Isnefja, in Kosova, most o f the land was owned by 30 Muslim families, but some fields were cultivated by tenants under sharecropping arrangements (PRO, F.O. 195/2453, 14.5.1913, Memorandum on the case of the village o f Isnef?a in the nahiye of Rayanovo of the district o f Kilki§, by Consul General Lamb). Likewise, in the central district of Uskiip, in 55 of 146 villages surveyed by the local authorities the land w as, cultivated both by small peasant proprietors and sharecroppers (PRO, FO 195/2232, 29.1.1906, Satow to Graves).
126 For instance, many tax farmers tended to overestimate the value of certain crops, such as grapes and fruits, the tithes o f which were paid in cash rather than in kind. In instances where the tithes were claimed in kind, such as cereals, the tax farmers often tried to overstate the amount o f the crop in question. For extortions and fraudulent activities o f tax farmers, see,, PRO, FO 195/1362, Extract from a letter from Mr. Consul General Blunt’s correspondent at Serres on August 23, 1881; PRO, F.O. 94/17, 26.11.1892, Shipley to Blunt; BA, TFR.l.SL., 16/1537-1, 12.Ca.1321 (6.8.1903).
228


they were often caught upon the complaint of the irritated tax farmer and subsequently
faced serious charges o f tax evasion. The local courts appear to have systematically
ruled against the tax evaders and sentenced them to pay the due amount as well as a
substantial fine in order to discourage the farmers from resorting to similar action in the
future and to set an “example” for the neighbouring villages.128 At any rate, the
detrimental effects of the practice o f tax farming, in general, and extortions of tax
farmers, in particular, stand out as important factors that put peasant farmers under
economic distress.
The local authorities made repeated attempts to improve the methods of tithe
collection throughout the Hamidian era. In the early 1880s, the authorities abolished the
practice o f tax farming and appointed officers to collect the due taxes.129 These early
efforts yielded little success. The appointed tax collectors faced insurmountable
difficulties. First, the number of appointed officers was not sufficient for the prompt
collection of the tithes in the province. This led to serious delays in the collection of the
tithes and gave way to tax evasion and loss of revenue.130 Secondly, the officers were
unable to market the in-kind tithe payments at favourable prices. The difficulty of
finding purchasers in the regional markets that were dominated by prominent notables,
landlords, merchants and usurers, who also had a substantial stake in tax farming,
proved particularly prohibitive and led to grave revenue losses for the local
government.131 The inadequacy o f storage facilities and roads further exacerbated the
problems faced by the officials.132 Finally, some opportunistic government officials
abused their authority for personal gain. Some accepted bribes and turned a blind eye to
those who evaded taxation. Others confiscated the produce in storehouses and some
simply played with accounts to embezzle public revenue. After four years of this
desperate trial, the authorities once again reverted to the practice o f tax farming.

During the late 1880s and the 1890s, the local authorities tried to impose tighter
controls on tax farmers, and took measures that would help improve the efficiency of
tax collection in general. Attempts were made to improve the competitiveness of tax
farming auctions and to assure the fairness of the bids made by potential tax farmers.
Also, certain administrative and bureaucratic measures were taken to impose tighter
control on government officials in charge of tax farming auctions, in particular, and the
collection of taxes, in general. In addition, efforts were made to secure the prompt
payment o f revenues by the tax farmers.133 Although abuse o f authority, extortions and
other fraudulent practices could be seen during this later period as well,134 the efforts
yielded some success, particularly towards the turn o f the century. The authorities
managed to enhance the competitiveness of auctions and to receive better prices for the
tax-farms, especially in the late 1890s and the early 1900s.135 Thus, the government’s
efforts helped consolidate state finances and bring some degree of order to fiscal
processes during the late Hamidian period. However, the local authorities could do little
to interfere in the redistributional relationship between the tax farmer and the taxpayer,
which enabled the tax farmers to continue to exploit the cultivators.
The government was able to take more systematic measures that aimed at
circumscribing the exploitative power of the tax farmers only after the turn of the
century. In connection with the broader reorganisation of the administration of the
Macedonian provinces, the central government again attempted to establish a more
direct fiscal relationship with the taxpayer. This time the government did not attempt to
collect the tithes directly from the taxpayers. Rather, it tried to introduce alternative
methods that would give priority to villagers in tax farming auctions. Thus, ideally, the
tax farmer could be eliminated and the taxes could be collected in cash in a way

The governor probably took a handsome commission in return for his services. The investigations failed to prove the involvement o f the governor in such practices, yet he was taken from his duty in Tikve§ and reappointed to a distant post (BA; §D-Selanik, 2034/4, 8.M.1317 (18.5.1899)).

landlords, who had a substantial interest in tax farming, responded swiftly against this
decision and put considerable pressure on peasant villages to withdraw from the
auctions.136 Soon, it became apparent that it would indeed be very difficult to by-pass
the prominent landlords cum established tax farmers, as long as the practice of tax
farming itself remained in effect. In response, the local authorities attempted to
introduce a fixed land tax that would replace the proportional tithe. The scheme was
initiated first in thirty selected villages of the neighbouring province o f Kosova in 1904.
The local authorities sent out officials to these villages in order to determine, together
with the local village councils and agricultural inspectors, the productivity and the
average annual yield o f the land in the possession of each household. Thus, the
contribution o f each household to the total fiscal burden of the entire village commune
was determined. After this point, the authorities took the average annual value of the
tithe returns accruing from the tax-farm auctions of the previous five years and
determined the annual tax burden o f the village commune according to this average.137
Each year, the appointed officers would make the necessary adjustments and register the
changes in the composition and the amount of the produce in each village so as to
prevent over or under taxation in subsequent years.138
The scheme was successful and satisfied both the villagers and the authorities
alike. The villagers paid their taxes promptly and almost no payments were left in
arrears. Encouraged by the success of the scheme, the authorities extended it further to
include the respective central districts (kazas) of the Provinces o f Manastir and Selanik
the following year. Government officials carried out similar surveys in designated
villages and set the fiscal liability of each village household.139 Again the scheme
proved a success and the villagers paid the due taxes promptly without leaving much in
arrears.140 However, the resistance of landlords and other prominent individuals
undermined the expansion of the scheme to other districts in the province.141 In most
districts o f the province o f Selanik, tax farming remained in effect until the end of the
period under consideration.

Another important push factor that enticed peasants to migrate was the
deteriorating political circumstances in the countryside, especially after the turn of the
century. Mounting ethnic conflicts and the tension between armed Greek and Bulgarian
bands, on the one hand, and the Ottoman security forces, on the other, posed a threat to
the lives and property o f peasant proprietors. Under the circumstances, many families
left rural areas and sought refuge in the relative security of the proliferating urban areas.
The relative lightness o f urban taxes, which included a low revenue (temettu) tax on
businesses and the usual property (emlak) taxes, was probably another important factor
that encouraged farmers to migrate to urban areas. Others left the region for Greece and
Bulgaria and started new lives as agriculturalists or urban workers. Thousands more
emigrated to the United States in pursuit of new opportunities and handsome
remittences.142
Overall, the consolidation o f property rights and the liberalisation of land
transactions had far reaching, if contradictory, consequences for the peasant household
economy and the agricultural sector. On the one hand, the consolidation of property
rights and the liberalisation o f land transactions worked well with the moment of
commercialisation and the ongoing process of integration with the world capitalist
economy. These legal measures helped create the appropriate incentive structure that
encouraged proprietors to respond to market signals with vitality and facilitated the
proprietors’ access to financial markets. On the other hand, the same legal process
exposed peasants to market risks more directly and set the institutional background to
their dispossession under unfavourable economic, fiscal and political conditions. Rural
displacement had far reaching consequences. First, it underscored the persistence and
spread o f exploitative tenancy relations in the region. Secondly, displacement
underlined the depopulation of rural areas, which ultimately brought the agrarian
economy o f Selanik to a halt and furthered its steady contraction from the early 1900s
onwards. The very same process set the institutional background to processes of
urbanisation and thus put its imprint on the ongoing modernisation process.
232


3.2. Property Rights and the Crisis of the G iftlik Economy
The consolidation of property rights and the increasing commodification of land
had important implications for the estate owners as well. First, the new legal and
institutional framework bestowed considerable power on the landlords and enabled
them to appropriate the economic surplus generated within the giftlik economy on quite
favourable terms, as indicated by the specific tenancy agreements discussed above.
Ortakgilik constituted the most secure form of surplus appropriation for the estate
owners. The practice not only guaranteed the proprietor the 50.0% share of the giftlik's
annual produce, but it also provided him the necessary labour supply. In addition, the
rent accruing from the lease o f fallow lands and meadows as winter pastures provided
an extra source o f income for the giftlik owners. The new laws secured the economic
advantages o f the landlords. The law recognised the inviolability and exclusiveness of
their ownership rights. The judiciary and the security forces enforced these rights. Thus,
the legal and administrative reforms further empowered the landlords. Under the
circumstances, the giftliks emerged as the ideal rent yielding property, provided that the
giftlik owners were able to recruit the labour power they needed in their estates.
As we have seen, the indebtedness of tenant farmers served as an important, if
not the primary, means o f labour procurement in the giftliks. From the viewpoint of the
landlord, the indebtedness of tenants was particularly advantageous, for it largely
moderated the difficulty of recruiting agricultural workers in an economic setting where
labour power constituted the scarce factor of production (see below). However, the debt
bondage did not necessarily imply that the landlord had the capacity to squeeze the last
farthing out of his tenants. Labour relations that prevailed in most giftliks were often
quite balanced. Contemporary sources describe the relationship between the landlords
and the tenants as “friendly” and based on “mutual interest”. The landlords were often
careful not to upset the tenants, especially the ortakgis and the kesmecis, who,
constituted the cream of rural workers in the region because they brought into the
partnership their draught animals and farm implements. Acute labour scarcity and the
keen competition among landlords for sharecroppers and other agricultural workers
evidently played a significant role in securing the general well being of the tenants.
Thus, the tenants were able to use the gardens and grazing grounds of the giftlik, which,
as we have seen, provided the tenants with an important source o f livelihood and
142 Gounaris, “Emigration from Macedonia”:
233


subsistence. The giftlik owners also helped the tenants at times of need. The landlords
provided seeds and allowances to the tenants at times of crop failures, so as to secure
the continuation o f agricultural production in their estates. Under the circumstances, the
tenants often behaved dutifully and worked to the best of their ability. As we shall see,
adverse political and economic circumstances began to disrupt these “friendly”
relations. The bitter disputes that arose between some landlords and their tenants
brought the giftlik economy to a halt from the early 1900s onwards. However, the
landlords could control the labour process in their estates and appropriate the surplus
without prohibitive problems and on quite favourable terms during the 1880s and the
1890s. In this regard, the landlords clearly benefited from the legal empowerment
provided by their ownership status and the institutional reforms that uphold this status.
This empowerment and the landlords’ capacity to expropriate at economic surplus
largely explain the strong desire to amass landed property, particularly in the relatively
densely populated, commercially developed and rail-connected parts o f the region.143
During the entire period, the real problem for the landlords was to recruit
seasonal workers to assist the sharecroppers during peak harvest time. Selanik had an
extremely low population density. The overall surface of the province was around
36,700 square kilometres.144 This suggests that the population density of the region
never really exceeded 33 people per square kilometre during the period under
consideration. According to Palairet’s figures, this figure was well below that of many
comparable Balkan economies at the time. For instance, the population density of Serbia
was 60.5 person per square kilometres in 1910, while the same figure was 49.6 for
Dalmatia, 45.6 for Bulgaria, 41.8 for Greece and 37.1 for Bosnia. The population
density o f Selanik exceeded only that o f Montenegro, which had only 24.6 residents per
square kilometre. Clearly, labour scarcity remained a serious structural problem for
giftlik owners, regardless of the changes taking place in the level and composition of
regional population.
Emigration and urban migration intensified the problem of labour scarcity in
rural areas and the pressure on estate owners. For example, in the aftermath of the
cessation o f Thesally to Greece in 1885, mass emigration from the region gave way to
143 Baker, Turkey, 399-412.

acute scarcity of labour in the countryside and compelled many estate owners to
experiment with labour saving technology in their estates.145 However, labour scarcity
intensified considerably after the turn of the century. The rapid growth o f urban
economies, the boom in the tobacco trade, and the intensification of political turmoil in
the entire Macedonian countryside had serious dislocating effects for the giftlik
economy.
First, rural depopulation caused by urban migration and emigration proved
particularly distressing for the giftlik owners. As the agricultural workers coming from.
the highlands and other regions increasingly sought their fortunes in the growing urban
areas and abroad, the supply of labour that could be employed readily in the estates on a
seasonal basis contracted quite notably.
Second, the growing attraction of cash crop production brought about certain
dislocations in regional labour markets. More specifically, the spread of tobacco
production in highland districts encouraged many agricultural workers to stay in their
villages in order to contribute to the production o f this highly labour intensive crop
within the family unit. As opposed to seeking, employment in giftliks as they used to.
The mounting political instability throughout the region seriously upset the
relations between the typically Christian tenants and Muslim landlords and rendered the
recruitment of labour more problematic for the giftlik owners. In some instances, such as
the above mentioned case of Akil Bey, political tensions gave way to the expulsion of
tenants from the estates, despite the growing severity o f labour shortages. Not
surprisingly, some estate owners who faced problems similar to those of Akil Bey
switched to land intensive.animal husbandry, while others simply chose to liquidate
their estates. In short estate ownership became an increasingly problematic endeavour in
the Selanik region.
Local peasants bought some or parts of these liquidated estates.146 It appears that
the Ottoman state also showed some interest in these liquidated estates and purchased

235


them to settle some of the immigrant Muslim families coming from Bulgaria.147 Strong
motives to amass landed property persisted, particularly amongst the burgeoning
commercial classes of the region. In some instances, purely speculative motives stirred
the acquisition of landed property. Prominent notables, powerful merchants and bankers
cum moneylenders competed keenly to acquire landed property in anticipation of future
profits, particularly in the commercially developed parts o f the region and along the
railway lines.148
Other motives, for land acquisition were o f a more subtle nature. First, land
remained the most tangible guarantee for creditors in local credit markets. Notables,
merchants, bankers and usurers dominated local credit markets, and extended credit to
peasant farmers and needy landlords, who mortgaged their land or offered it as
collateral in return for the money they borrowed. Subsequent failure to pay outstanding
financial obligations ultimately gave way to the concentration of landed property in the
hands o f creditors, although this outcome was not necessarily advantageous for them. A
stark example o f disadvantageous acquisitions can be seen in the transactions of the
Modiyano and Alatini families. During the 1890s and the early 1900s, these families
extended credit to petty farmers, needy landlords and other individuals in possession of
real property. In addition, both families guaranteed the contracts of some prominent tax
farmers in return for collaterals.149 Most of the capital needed for such transactions was
provided by Banque de Salonique, which the Modiyanos and the Alatinis controlled
together with a consortium of French bankers. In addition, both families borrowed
heavily in international capital markets and from other banks operating in the region.
Thus, both families incurred heavy debts and placed considerable capital in speculative
credit arrangements. This situation eventually led both families to bankruptcy. As land
prices started collapsing in the aftermath of the Ottoman Italian War of 1911, the
Modiyanos and Alatinis realised that they could not fulfill their outstanding financial
obligations. Although the value of the assets (O.L. 700,000) owned by the two families
*47 for the settlement o f immigrants into former $iftliks see BA, M.V. 140/33, 6.C.1328 (14.6.1910).
148 For an example of such speculative land transactions, see the case o f Tahir Umur Pa§a, who purchased an estate belonging to the Civil List in the district o f Drama with a view to sell it in parcels to private parties. Tahir Umur Pa§a, travelled to Istanbul on numerous occasions and lobbied actively there to secure the sale of the estate to him. Eventually, the Pa§a acquired the estate for 700,000 kuru§es in total. However, subsequent investigations revealed that the real value of the estate was at least 2,000,000 kuru$es (BA, B.E.O.-Ayniyat, 668/394). The available documentation does not reveal how the case was finally resolved. However, the document illustrates the speculative motives underlining certain real estate transactions.
236


were sufficient to meet their liabilities (O.L. 400,000), the realisable value o f their
assets was much lower. Unable to pay their outstanding financial obligations, the
leading members of both families hurriedly left for Paris by early morning train on
December 1, 1911, without even declaring a moratorium on their business
transactions.150
Secondly, real estate ownership provided the means necessary to enter into the
lucrative business of tax collection. Tax farmers were required to show real estate in
their possession as collateral, before they could make a bid to acquire the privileges
associated with tax collection. These privileges came with a risk. If a tax farmer failed
to pay the agreed-upon sum fully and promptly to the government, the authorities
simply sequestrated the property shown as collateral and auctioned it to recover the
difference in question. Thus, the government saw collateral as a security for the
protection o f the interests of the public treasury and the prompt payment of the revenues
owed by the tax farmers. The authorities followed quite a strict policy in this regard and
did not hesitate to sequester and auction the property o f the tax farmers who failed to
fulfil their obligations. Countless examples of such sequestrations appear in documents
related to the Selanik province in the fiscal (maliye) section of the Supreme Council of
State (§urayi Devlet) documents. The same documents and other sources, however, also
indicate that tax farmers found ways of getting around the regulations. For example,
many tax farmers acquired virtually useless landed property and showed it as collateral
at a value well above its actual market value. In such instances, the tax farmers could
easily default on their obligations. The government authorities would then encounter
serious difficulties in recovering the revenue thus lost. Often no purchasers could be
found, and if the land was ever sold, the returns remained well below the amount owed
by the tax farmer.151 Despite repeated attempts to prevent such fraudulent practices by
an accurate assessment of the real estate shown as collateral, the problem was not
solved entirely and it continued to entail revenue losses for the government.
Nevertheless, it is clear that the requirement of real property as collateral against tax
farms allowed only the individuals in possession of landed property to enter auctions
and to benefit from the lucrative opportunity of appropriating and marketing the
agrarian surplus. This opportunity enhanced the attraction of acquiring landed property.

237


Finally, certain political considerations apparently played an important role in
the acquisition o f landed property in the region. For instance, the Ottoman government
showed some concern over the acquisition of extensive landed property by prominent
Bulgarian, Greek and Jewish merchants and moneylenders, whereas it encouraged some
Muslim notables to hold onto and expand their landed property regardless of the
economic circumstances. Indeed, many Muslim notables continued to buy land in the
region, despite the intensifying problem of labour scarcity and procurement.152
Thus, considerable capital was tied to unproductive ends. Speculative land
transactions tied valuable capital to agricultural pursuits where productivity was low
and the labour market constraint was almost prohibitive. Also the attraction of usury
practices, especially of tax farming, enticed economic agents to invest considerable
sums in land, for the ownership o f this primary factor o f production was a precondition
to access credit markets. More specifically, debtors had to hold land to borrow in private
and public markets and creditors had to hold land to become tax farmers. As
considerable capital was tied to speculative transactions and usury practices, little
capital could be channelled into productive investments. This situation, among other
reasons, kept the “developmental” potential of the regional economy at bay during the
period under consideration.
Conclusion
Overall, the consolidation of property rights over land emerges as an important
dynamic underlying the structural changes in the regional economy. The consolidation
of property rights facilitated the processes of commercialisation and the growth of
commercial agriculture in the region. Simultaneously, it enhanced the processes of
dispossession and rural displacement, which, in turn, culminated in urban migration and
emigration amid growing ethnic tensions and rising tax burden. The destructive

238


creativity of modernisation found its clear manifestation in the consolidation of property
rights and subsequent processes of urbanisation and commercialisation.
The consolidation of property rights and the restructuring of the taxation
processes had serious implications also for the pattern of capital accumulation and
investment. First, consolidation o f property rights and the associated liberalisation of
collaterals and mortgages undergirded the emergence of a fluid land market in the
region. This development had important, if contradictory, implications for the
transformation o f the regional economy during the period under consideration. On the
one hand, it facilitated proprietors’ access to credit markets, for they could now show
their property as collateral against the credits they acquired. Despite all the problems
involved in such credit arrangements, these credits contributed to the commercialisation
and stability o f the agricultural sector in a broadly structural sense. However, the
emergence o f a fluid land market also exacerbated speculative motives and encouraged
many merchants, bankers and landlords to acquire massive amounts of property that
yielded relatively little profits in both the short and medium term. This situation not
only undermined productive investment, but it also seriously curtailed the broader
process o f the valorisation,of capital.
The taxation process had import dislocating effects on the agrarian economy.
Excessive taxation and the extortions of tax farmers put an immense burden on the
peasant household economy, and fed the processes of dispossession, urban migration
and emigration. Perhaps more importantly, the practice of tax farming itself emerged as
an economic domain within which rent-seeking motives were most manifest. The
practice o f tax farming was possibly the most lucrative means of income generation for
those in possession o f landed property and for those who had access to or control over
financial resources. This situation exacerbated intense speculation over the sale and.
purchase o f real estate and tied usury and mercantile capital into fictitious transactions,
which naturally increased the opportunity cost of investing in alternative, higher
productivity pursuits in agriculture and manufacturing.
The transformation of the socio-economic domain occupied by property and
redistribution had a dual impact on the transformation of the regional economy.
Redistribution processes were in line with the broader commercialisation process and
helped consolidate the integration of the regional economy with the expanding capitalist
239


moment in world history. However, the same processes and structures exacerbated rent
seeking motives and speculative transactions which seriously curtailed the valorisation
of capital and thus undermined the development of primary sectors of the regional
economy. Thus, there emerged in Selanik a highly commercialised economy marked by
strong dynamics o f dispossession, insecurity and exploitation, on the one hand, and the
“black hole” of speculative motives and speculative transactions that absorbed the
growth and modernisation potential o f the regional economy, on the other.

CHAPTER-V
FACETS OF MODERNISATION:
SERVICES, URBAN CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND MANUFACTURING
Introduction
In the previous chapters, I have concentrated mainly on the transformation of the
rural economy. I have discussed the impact o f world economic forces, the
modernisation efforts o f the Ottoman government, and property relations on the
transformation of the agricultural sector. I have argued that these forces and processes
had a combined, dual impact on agriculture. They enhanced commercialisation and
contributed, in important ways, to the development and growth of certain sub-sectors of
the agrarian economy, namely tobacco, silk and opium production. However, the same
processes gave way to serious retardation in other sub-sectors. Enhanced integration
with the international markets and the subsequent intensification of overseas
competition put considerable pressure on cereal and cotton cultivators and eventually
led to serious retardation in these primary sub-sectors o f the agrarian economy.
Likewise, the organisational and financial weakness o f the Ottoman government
underlay retardation in agriculture. Although certain financial and organisational
measures taken by the Ottoman government contributed to the commercialisation and
overall stability of the agricultural sector, these modernisation efforts fell short of
generating the desired break-through in the agricultural sector. Pressed hard under
complex political, diplomatic and fiscal problems, the Ottoman government ultimately
failed to provide sufficient technical, logistic and financial support to local farmers, and
it could not provide them with an effective bulwark against the winds of foreign
competition in domestic markets. Under the circumstances, the sub-sectors that were not
241


favoured by the world economy remained seriously retarded. Finally, the relations of
property and redistribution that prevailed in the region also contributed this twofold
rural structure. The consolidation o f property rights and the liberalisation of the land
regime combined well with the moment of commercialisation and integration with
capitalist world economy. However, certain rigidities inherent in the prevailing systems
of land-tenure and the associated mechanisms of surplus appropriation and taxation
deepened the retardation process. This complex set of developments generated a strong
“push-factor” that led people away from agriculture and set the structural background
for rapid emigration from and urbanisation within the region.
In this final chapter, I will discuss the development of the modem urban sector. I
will concentrate mainly on the growth and development of the urban service sector, the
construction industry, and the manufacturing sector. By concentrating on the
development of the urban economy, I also hope to partially fill a persistent gap in the
existing literature, a gap that has impaired our vision and understanding of nineteenth
century Ottoman economy. Until the mid-1980s, scholars working on Ottoman
economic history concentrated mainly on agriculture and paid relatively little attention
to the transformation and development of urban sectors. Their focus on agriculture was
both justifiable and necessary, since agriculture constituted the most important sector of
the Ottoman economy and thus served as the key to understanding the broader trends of
the Ottoman economy. There were also good conceptual reasons for concentrating on
agriculture at the time. Theories o f economic development that were in vogue during the
1960s and 1970s, attributed considerable importance to the agricultural sector and
considered it as the primary source o f the capital and labour needed to reach the “take
o ff’ stage in modem economic growth.1 Ottoman economic historians commonly
subscribed to this liberal approach at the time and made a considerable effort to study
the agricultural sector.2 Other sectors went largely under-studied, except a few
pioneering studies.3

In the mid-late 1980s, the World System Analysis (WSA) redefined the research
agenda in Ottoman social and economic history and left a strong imprint that still
prevails in the field. The proponents o f the WSA concentrated on agriculture, but they
also discussed the rapid development o f the commercial economy in rich historical
detail and paid considerable attention to networks of commodity circulation and credit.4.
In addition, the WSA paid considerable attention to the transformation of the
manufacturing industries throughout the empire5 and to the rapid development of towns,
especially of port-cities, throughout the Eastern Mediterranean basin.6
Despite the contributions of the WSA, our knowledge o f urban economic life
and the development o f urban sectors still remain relatively limited. For instance, there
has been little research on the development of the urban service sector, except for a few

Likewise, the development of the urban construction sector received very little attention
from economic historians, except for a few scholars who have undertaken pioneering
research on the transformation of urban landscapes and architectural styles in the
leading towns of the Empire.8 Finally, the economic history of the Ottoman
manufacturing industry has yet to be written, building on Quataert’s pioneering work,
which has enhanced our vision of nineteenth century Ottoman manufactures
considerably.9
The current chapter is an attempt to begin to fill the gap in our knowledge of
urban economies and their development during the late nineteenth and the early
twentieth centuries. The chapter relies on a broad range o f primary sources and an
extensive secondary literature in an effort to provide a comprehensive picture of urban
development and economic transformation in the region. In the first section, I discuss
the pull-factors underlying urbanisation, namely growing integration into the world
economy along with arrival o f railways and the rapid growth of commercial agriculture
in the region. In the second section, I consider the development of the urban service
sector in tandem with the proliferation of commerce and trade. In the third section, I
discuss the physical development o f the regional towns, with an emphasis on Salonica,
which represented the urban experience par excellance at the time. Finally, I discuss the
development of the manufacturing industries in the region, focusing on the growth of
the factory system as well as developments in artisanal manufacturing. The chapter ends

with some concluding remarks on the overall dynamics of modernisation and the
associated proliferation of urban economies throughout the region.
1. The Dynamics of Urbanisation: Railways, Overseas Trade and Commercial Agriculture
The arrival o f railways in the region had far reaching economic consequences.
Despite all the problems encountered in the operation and pricing of railway services in
the region, railways certainly enhanced the region’s integration with global markets and
contributed to the expansion and deepening of the commercial economy.10 Railways
integrated Salonica to its hinterland and the inland commercial centres of the Southern
Balkans much more effectively than before. Salonica emerged as the primary
commercial gateway that linked the region via the Mediterranean basin to global
markets. The commercial dynamism that the railroads thus generated is directly related
to the dynamics o f urbanisation in the region during the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries. In what follows, I discuss the impact o f railways on commerce and
urbanisation.
A consortium of French and Austrian bankers led by an energetic Belgian
banker, Baron Maurice de Hirsch, built the first railway line in the region, connecting
Salonica to the northern Macedonian town o f Uskiip (Skopje). Its construction
commenced in 1871, and the entire 219-mile network was opened to public traffic on
December 29, 1874. In 1888, a new extension line connected the Salonica-Uskup line to
the Serbian network. Thus, the port-town of Salonica was connected to continental
Europe via the Serbian and Austria-Hungarian railway networks. Soon the Paris
Belgrade-Salonica route became the shortest and quickest connection that linked
Northern Europe to Asia via Port Said.11 The British-Indian mail service began to run
through Salonica and the bulk o f almost the entire Serbian transit trade came to be
conducted through the town.12

These developments naturally enhanced commercial activity in the region,
especially in Salonica. Both the overseas trade and the volume of shipping conducted at
the port of Salonica increased considerably during the 1880s and the early 1890s (See
Charts 5.1 and 5.2).13 By the mid-1890s, Salonica had become one of the most
important terminal points in communications and trade linking the southern Balkan
Peninsula to Europe, thanks to Salonica’s railway and maritime connections. The
construction of two more railway lines that connected Salonica to Manastir in the west
and to Istanbul in the east, in 1894 and 1896, respectively, enhanced intra-regional trade
among the Macedonian provinces and consolidated Salonica’s undisputed central
position in the region.14

The advent o f the railways brought about important transformations in the
regional economy. The most important transformation probably took place in the
organisation of marketing networks throughout the region. Prior to the arrival of the
railways, such leading towns as Salonica, Siroz, Drama, Vodine, Karaferye, and Kavala
served as primary centres o f distribution and marketing in the region.15 In addition,
numerous fairs and market places facilitated commercial relations. However,
transportation facilities and commercial connections remained relatively undeveloped.
The bulk of the regional trade took place in small market places that were regularly set,
up in towns once or twice each week.16 Local producers and petty merchants marketed
their produce mainly in these local markets. Intermediary merchants and retailers
working with import/export houses of Salonica also sold their merchandise and bought
the local produce for export in local markets.17 A number o f fairs served as important
loci o f commercial activity in the region at large. Although these fairs were much more
important in the earlier decades of the nineteenth century, they continued to serve
important functions and provided producers and merchants with a regulated economic

environment where products could be traded commonly in large quantities.18 According
to one contemporary estimate, the trading volume of nine fairs still operating in the
region amounted to O.L. 75,000 in the early 1890s.19
The arrival of the railways led to a reorganisation of marketing networks.
Railways quickly became the main commercial arteries of the region, and caravan trade
quickly lost its importance and became subsidiary to railway carriage, which provided
merchants and producers with cheaper, faster and more secure means of transportation.20
Subsequently, the rail-connected towns emerged as the primary loci o f marketing and
exchange in the region. The trading houses of Salonica set up offices and retail shops in
these towns and from there reached the entire countryside through a well connected
network o f intermediary merchants, retailers and local representatives. An extensive
chain o f village-based small retail shops also supported this distribution network. Thus,
marketing increasingly assumed a hierarchical structure in the region, as the trading
houses of Salonica increasingly dominated local markets both as mass purchasers of
local produce and as retailers o f imported products. Spatially, commercial activity
concentrated increasingly in rail-connected towns and extended in a web-like fashion
down to the hamlets and villages. In due time, the local markets, and the once prolific
fairs lost their importance and were pushed to the bottom of the newly established
marketing hierarchies 21
A comprehensive credit system supported the entire marketing network,
enabling the agents and intermediaries to run their petty businesses in cooperation with
the prominent trading houses of Salonica. Prior to the 1880s, such businesses were
conducted primarily through private credit arrangements between merchants and
moneylenders 22 The Ottoman Bank was the only financial institution in the region and
the bank’s commercial functions were limited. It mainly handled government accounts
and extended credit to provincial administrations.23 With the arrival of railways and

growing tide of commercialisation in the region, however, the need for commercial
banks became quite pressing for all parties involved in trade. In response to this need, a
group of prominent merchants from Salonica established a new commercial bank in
Salonica in cooperation with the Landerbank of Vienna and the Comptoir d ’Escompte
of Paris in 1888. The new bank, Banque de Salonique, liberally extended credit to the
mercantile community and provided financial support for agents and trading houses
involved in overseas trade.24 In 1899, the Banque de Mytilini was established mainly to
serve Greek commercial interests in the region. In 1905, the Bank o fIndustrial Credit o f
Athens merged with the Bank o f Athens within two years and it served similar ends. In
1906, the German Orient Bank started its operations in Salonica. The Orient Bank was
actually a branch o f Deutsche Orient Bank, which was founded in the same year in
Istanbul. In 1908, the Serbian Beogradska Zadruga was established in Salonica. Finally,
the Bulgarian National Bank opened a branch in Salonica in December 1912. These
credit institutions, especially Banque de Salonique and Banque de Mytilini, contributed
to the development o f the commercial economy and the expansion of overseas trade.
Also, they provided capital for the establishment of new trading and manufacturing
concerns in the region 25
The region’s enhanced integration into the world economy underlay the growth
of port-cites and rail-connected towns as important centres o f commerce, finance and
manufacturing. Salonica grew by leaps and bounds as the leading port-town of the
Southern Balkan Peninsula, and it served as an important commercial gateway between
its vast hinterland and international markets. Likewise, rail-connected towns that had
considerable agricultural potential grew rapidly during the period under consideration.
Such important centres of commercial agriculture as Siroz, Drama, Istrumca,
Tikve§/Kavadar, Avrethisan, Karaferye, Gevgeli, and Yenice emerged as leading
centres of commerce upon the arrival o f the railways and grew rapidly during the 1880s
and the 1890s.26 The rapid growth o f cash crop production in these districts during the
same period also contributed to the expansion of trade and the concomitant growth of
these towns. For instance, the growth of such railway towns as Istrumca,
Tikve§/Kavadar and Gevgeli owed much to the proliferation of sericulture and opium

production in these districts. Likewise, the rapid growth of Siroz, Drama and Yenice
was associated with the impressive growth of cotton and especially tobacco cultivation
in their immediate hinterlands.27 The propulsive impact of commercial agriculture on
urban growth manifested particularly in Kavala’s impressive growth during the period
under consideration. In the 1870s, Kavala was a trivial port-town with a population of
only 5,000 residents. During the 1880s and especially the 1890s, the town grew as the
primary centre of tobacco trade in the region. In this period, the expanding tobacco trade
gradually shifted away from Salonica and concentrated in the port-town of Kavala,
which was closer to the primary tobacco producing districts, Drama, Kavala, Provide,
and San-§aban. Accordingly, the population of the town rose rapidly in the same
period, to reach 24,000 in 1911. On the eve of the Balkan Wars, Kavala had become the
third largest city in the region, after Salonica and Siroz 28

Overall, the arrival of railways strengthened the region’s commercial ties with
overseas markets and undergirded the acceleration of urbanisation in the region. As.
port-cities and rail-connected towns emerged as the primary loci of distribution and
marketing, thousands o f refugees, displaced peasant families and other agricultural
workers migrated to urban areas, both on a permanent and seasonal basis, in a quest of
jobs in the proliferating urban sectors. In this regard, the rapid development of the urban
service sector was an important pull factor that attracted thousands into the urban areas.
2. The Development of the Urban Service Sector
The urban service sector constituted one of the most dynamic components of
urban economic life in the region. The following discussion indicates that the sector
expanded notably during the period under consideration and gradually became a leading
field o f economic activity in the region. This expansion was in tandem with the region’s .
growing integration into the world economy. Below I concentrate on developments in
three segments o f the urban service sector, namely transport and commerce, catering
and consumer services, and modem urban professions.
2.1. Commerce and Transportation Services
The intensification of commercial activity in port cities and rail-linked towns
was the primary dynamic that underlay the rapid development of the urban service
sector. The apparent dynamism of the transport sector was probably the clearest
manifestation of this link between commercialisation and the development of the
service sector. Thousands were employed as boatmen, porters and carriers at harbours,
quays, railway stations, as well as at local markets, bazaars, and fairs. The porters and
the boatmen of Salonica were an important component of the work force employed in
transportation. The boatmen carried the merchandise between the ships anchored at the
port and the quay line that stretched along the seashore. At the quay, the porters handled
the merchandise and carried it over to the warehouses and depots, which were mostly
situated at the west-end of the town. In addition, the porters carried goods between the
quays and the railway terminus located at the Vardar Kapi Quarter located also in the
west-end. In addition, many unskilled labourers worked as simple carriers, especially in
the bazaars and the market places. The number of porters, boatmen and ordinary carriers
251


working in Salonica is difficult to determine. However, some contemporary accounts
suggest that their numbers could be measured in hundreds, if not thousands.29 The same
accounts and other evidence indicate that the number o f workers employed in
transportation increased steadily in tandem with the rapid growth of overseas trade and
the expansion o f railway services in the region.
The railways brought a similar dynamism to the transportation sector in interior
towns as well. The railway companies hired hundreds of workers, including drivers,
conductors, station workers, guards, technicians, engineers, porters, and other
administrative employees, such as clerks, goods managers, weighers and loading clerks.
The Oriental Railway Company employed a technical and administrative staff of about
300 people in the early 1880s.30 Following the completion of the Manastir and Istanbul
lines, the total number of employees working for the railway companies probably
reached 1,000. Many more workers must have been employed as ordinary porters and
carriers in the railway towns. We lack the data that would help us estimate long-term
changes in the numbers o f transportation workers. Logically speaking, however, we can
maintain that employment opportunities in the transportation sector were very limited
before the arrival of the railways and that they steadily increased thereafter.
The provision of transportation services for urban commuters was another
important field of economic activity. The physical expansion o f the towns brought about
an acute problem o f public transportation in urban centres. Especially in Salonica,
thousands of workers and employees had to commute to and from work every day of the
week, including Saturdays and Sundays. In the late 1880s, 20 omnibuses and about 200
horse carriages constituted the primary means of public transport in Salonica. In
addition, about 300 rowing boats ran along the quays carrying hundreds of passengers

between the residential quarters of the east-end and the city centre every day.31
However, these services were far from being sufficient to meet the needs of the growing
urban population. Soon, commuting became a pressing problem that caused serious
delays at work, particularly in the morning hours. The construction of a relatively
comprehensive tram network in 1893 somewhat alleviated the congestion in the streets
of Salonica.32 Yet, for all these improvements, the Tram Company was unable to keep
up with the rapid growth of the town. Numerous extensions over the network and the
improvement of services during the early 1900s did little to solve the problem of
commuting and traffic congestion. The trams were often packed during the rush hours,
and many residents still ended up taking omnibuses and carriages to commute to work.
This situation led to frequent traffic jams in the city centre, particularly along the quays.
In response, the town council considered alternative means of public transportation and
proposed to run ferry services along the coastline in order to facilitate public
transportation in Salonica.33 The proposal soon materialised, and the first ferry services
started running along the shores o f Salonica in 1907.34 Thus, public transportation
became a “sector” on its own with the establishment of tram and ferry services in the
town. The tram and ferry companies probably employed hundreds of workers. In
addition, hundreds more earned a living from carriage and omnibus traffic and many
more worked as boatmen carrying urban commuters along the quays. Salonica’s public
transportation system was exceptionally well developed in comparison to other towns of
the region. Nevertheless, public transportation was probably a growing field of
economic activity also in the other towns that had a growing and sizeable population
such as Siroz, Tikve§/KaVadar, Karaferye, Drama and Kavala. Unfortunately, we lack
the information on the extent and growth of the public transportation sector in these
towns.
2.2. Catering and Consumer Services
Urban growth brought about the need to provide basic as well as luxury services
to the urban population. Above all, providing the foodstuffs and other basic consumer
goods for the market dependent, wage-earning urban population acquired increasing
economic significance in almost every town of the region. Hundreds o f petty street.

253


traders, shopkeepers, greengrocers, fruiters, bakers, butchers and fish, chicken, milk,
cheese, butter and yogurt sellers provided basic foodstuffs for the urban residents.
Likewise, other petty traders sold certain luxury goods, such as wines, spirits, sugar,
candy, dried fruit and coffee to more prosperous residents, who were rapidly acquiring
new tastes and lifestyles in the proliferating urban areas. Also, such artisans as public
bath workers and barbers provided certain services that were essential for the well being
of the urban population. Many other artisans, such as carpenters, glaziers, well makers
and bricklayers, were employed to repair buildings and to maintain other fixtures in
almost every town.
Table 5.1 provides a detailed list of such urban occupations and indicates the
number of artisans employed in catering and consumer services in the late 1880s. Since
these statistics incorporate only the number of registered, full-time artisans, the
workforce employed in this important branch of the service sector appears smaller than
we would normally expect. For instance, the official statistics cite 25 public baths but
only nine public bath carers (hamamci) in the region. This simple observation attests to
the probable underestimation inherent in the data set. Nevertheless, the statistics
maintain the importance and diversity of the catering and consumer services in urban
economic life.
The provision of comfort, entertainment, as well as regular catering to urban
population also acquired increasing importance as new bourgeois lifestyles flourished in
the rapidly growing towns. Traditional coffeehouses, modem cafes, restaurants and
casinos provided entertainment for town residents and served as public spaces for
socialisation and recreational activity.35 Hotels, motels and inns that could be found in
almost every town provided shelter, comfort and food for visitors as well as for
bohemian residents who chose to live in the relatively sterile and liberal atmosphere of
the hotel rooms.36 Finally, cooks served food, pastry, and sometimes a shot of brandy or
ra h , or a warm cup o f tea or coffee, for the townspeople in small comer-shops or
mobile booths, particularly at lunchtime and in the “happy hour” after work. In other
words, the service sector developed by serving the “relaxation” and convenience of a

Thus, as urban centres grew, the demand for services increased proportionately,
creating new job opportunities and attracting many others to urban areas. In this sense,
the growth of catering and other urban consumer services appear as a self-perpetuating
process that was tuned to the growth of urban population and the associated emergence

of modem lifestyles. A work organisation process that revolved around in offices,
factories and warehouses sustained the vitality o f the urban consumer services.
2.3. M odern U rban Professions
One of the most important achievements of the Hamidian era was in the field of
human resource development. Political centralisation and socio-economic
modernisation were the two primary policy objectives of the Hamidian era. Sultan
Abdulhamid II and his advisers understood the importance of mass education for both
o f their policy objectives and put considerable energy and resources into reforming the
education system. New primary and secondary schools, military academies, vocational
schools, and universities were founded both in the provinces and in Istanbul in order to
train and educate new doctors, teachers, lawyers, judges, clerks, accountants,
administrators, officers and bureaucrats.38 Thousands of well-trained professionals
graduated from these institutions during the Hamidian era. This cadre of professionals
worked in private and public institutions and contributed to the modernisation and
centralisation drive in important ways.39 More significantly, they formed the backbone
of the emerging bourgeois middle-classes that played leading political roles in two
defining moments of Ottoman-Turkish history, namely the Young Turk revolution of
1908, and the foundation o f the Turkish Republic in the early 1920s.40
The growing commercial economy provided many opportunities for middle
class professionals in the Selanik region. The banks, commercial houses, insurance
agencies, and factories employed hundreds, if not thousands, of these educated
professionals as clerks, accountants, administrative assistants, legal consultants and
lawyers, and managers. We do not have detailed data on changes in the number of these
employees. However, it is possible to establish a broad trend by looking at the changes

in the number of trading houses, banks, insurance agencies, the manufacturing concerns
and schools operating in the region. The relevant data come from the provincial
yearbooks. I have compiled this data in Table 5.2 for two benchmark years for which
statistics were more comprehensive, that is for 1890 and 1907. The table points to a
considerable increase in the number of commercial, financial and other professional
institutions operating in the region during the period under consideration. Based on this
indicative evidence, it is fair to suggest that the number of professionals employed in
these establishments increased at least proportionately during the same period.

The centralisation and modernisation efforts of the Ottoman government, too,
contributed to the growth of the urban service sector in important ways. The deepening
of the government presence in the provinces and the associated improvements in local
government services created new employment opportunities for middle-class
professionals. Many high school and university graduates began their careers in
provincial governments as clerks, translators, administrators, experts and technicians.
Similar trends were at work also in Selanik. As I discussed in Chapter 3, the provincial
government expanded notably in the Selanik region during the Hamidian period. The
functions of the local government widened and new departments and government
offices specialising in different administrative and judicial tasks were established, or
expanded, at the sub-provincial and district levels. Accordingly, the number of officials
257


employed by the local government increased steadily during the Hamidian era. By the
late 1900s, provincial bureaucracy had become an integral component of the rapidly,
growing urban service sector.
In addition, the modernisation attempts of the Ottoman government contributed
to the rise o f the urban middle classes in the region. For example, we observe a
considerable increase in the number o f professionals employed in health and
educational services in the Selanik region. This development can be associated directly
with the Ottoman government’s efforts to modernise health and education services
throughout the empire. Although serious financial and institutional drawbacks continued
to impair the efficiency o f public health services until the end of the Hamidian era, the
achievements in this field were nevertheless quite impressive. The provincial
government established a number o f public and military hospitals in the region during
the 1880s and the 1890s. According to the official yearbooks, there were only three
hospitals in the region in the late 1870s.41 By the early 1900s, there were a total of 16
hospitals that provided basic health services to the general public and to the armed
forces stationed in the province (See Table 5.2) 42 We do not know the number of
doctors, nurses and other technical personnel employed in these hospitals, but their
numbers probably increased along with the establishment o f new hospitals. In addition,
private doctors, chemists and dentists provided health services to the local urban
population. The number o f these doctors, chemists and dentists increased during the
1890s and the 1900s. According to the data presented in Table 5.2, the number of
registered doctors working in the region increased from 14 to 45 between 1890-1907.
The number o f registered dentists and chemists rose to 7 and 42, respectively, by 1907.
We also see a notable improvement in education services in the region. The local
authorities established new elementary schools not only in the leading urban centres but
also in the villages during the period under consideration. In addition, new high schools
and vocational academies were established in order to train technicians and
administrators to be employed in local government offices and in the private sector. The
number o f public schools rose from 1,354 in 1890 to 1,901 in 1907 (See Table 5.2).
Official statistics on the number of teachers employed in these schools are not available,
41 1293 S.V.S., 1876, 77-79.
4^ There was at least one hospital in Salonica, Karaferye, Kesendire, Toyran, Istrumca, Katrin, Gevgeli, Drama, Kavala, Siroz, Demirhisar, Cuma-i Bala, Nevrekop and Razlik during the late 1900s. See 1324S.V.S. (1907: 293-495).
258


but it is possible that this number exceeded 4,000 in the late 1900s, whereas it probably
was at most 3,000 in the 1890s, and much smaller in earlier decades.
3. The Construction Boom and the Growth of Salonica
The construction sector emerged as one of the primary fields o f economic
activity and investment, especially from the mid-1890s onwards, when urbanisation
accelerated in the region. Thousands o f residential, commercial and public buildings, as
well as important urban infrastructures, were built to accommodate the ongoing process
of urban growth.
3.1. Regional Trends and Patterns
The Ottoman authorities compiled rich data on the number of commercial and
residential buildings existing in the leading towns of the region and regularly published
these statistics in provincial yearbooks (salnames). The data resulted from the
government’s efforts to clarify and consolidate its fiscal claims over the real estate
owned by individuals residing in urban areas.43 The authorities carefully monitored the
construction of residential and commercial buildings in order to secure the collection of.
property taxes (emlak vergisi). They systematically registered the nature, estimated
value, and the annual rent accruing from these buildings 44 The summary data published
in the salnames were probably based on these fiscal registers. I use these statistics to
demonstrate the dynamism-of the urban construction industry during the period under
consideration. The available data are quite detailed, but there are gaps in the information
provided. The provincial yearbooks for 1876 and 1882 contain ample data on the
number o f residential and commercial buildings. I rely mainly on these statistics in my
estimations for 1880. However, these particular provincial yearbooks do not contain
information on such important towns as Kavala, Gevgeli, Tikve§, Cuma-i Bala, Razlik,
Menlik, Petri?, Longaza and Katrin. In order to by-pass this statistical constraint, I rely

259


on the yearbooks for 1895 and 1896 to determine roughly the number o f buildings for
any observation missing in the earlier yearbooks and thus in my estimates for 1880.45
The resulting estimates for 1880 are slight over-representations. Probably, there
were fewer buildings in 1880 compared to the levels reached by the mid-1890s.
Therefore, carrying some of the 1895 and 1896 values over to 1880, almost certainly
inflates the earlier estimates, perhaps by as much as 10% for residential buildings, and
by 5% for commercial buildings.46 This adjustment, however, maintains the relative
comparability of the 1880 figures with the detailed statistics published in the 1907
yearbook, which covers the number o f buildings in all leading towns of the region. A
comparative analysis o f the 1880 estimates and the 1907 statistics enables me to observe,
the broad trends in the sector in a more consistent empirical framework. Table 5.3
presents the data set on which I base my observations.
Table 5.3 suggests .considerable dynamism in urban construction activity during
the period under consideration. According to the data, the number o f residential and
commercial buildings increased by 55.9% and 54.5% respectively. These numbers
slightly understate the actual dynamism of the construction industry during the 1880s,
1890s, and the 1900s. First, the overestimation inherent in the 1880 estimate leads to a
percentage figure that under-represents the expansion of the sector during the period
under consideration. Secondly, our proxy variable is not sensitive to the transformation
of architectural styles and reflects only changes in the actual number of buildings. As I
shall discuss below, the construction o f modem multi-story commercial and residential
buildings became quite fashionable in Salonica and other leading towns in the last,
quarter o f the nineteenth century. In this sense, there was an actual “deepening” of
construction activity, which our proxy variable does not represent. Finally, the proxy
variable does not take into account the contribution of such important infrastructure
investments as harbours, quays, paved streets and avenues, and water and gas works to
the dynamism of the urban construction sector (see below). All the same, the evident
The data contained in the 1895 and 1896 yearbooks were not as comprehensive as the earlier ones, but these yearbooks included valuable data on missing observations in the earlier yearbook. Therefore, I did not use 1895 and 1896 yearbooks as benchmark, but simply used the data contained in them to improve the accuracy and comparability of my estimates for 1880.
46 The available figures for residential buildings in 1880 and 1895 suggest that the number of residential buildings grew by about 38% during the 1880s and the early 1890s. The data carried over from c.1895 to 1880 accounted for about a third of the estimate for 1880. If so the values could have been inflated by slightly more than 10% in total. Similar considerations suggest a 5% overestimation for commercial buildings.
260


expansion in the number of urban dwellings and commercial buildings and the
associated (physical) growth of towns points to the dynamism o f the region’s urban
construction sector during the period under consideration.
Table 5.3 also reveals important clues about the forces underlying the apparent
dynamism of the construction industry. As I discussed above, growing integration into
the world economy, the construction of railways, and the simultaneous growth of the
commercial economy were the primary factors that underlay the processes of urban
growth in the Selanik region during the period under consideration.
Table 5.3 suggests that the same forces also fed into the physical expansion of
the towns. In order to demonstrate the impact of these factors, I have grouped the
leading towns of the region in accordance with their ideal type characteristics. I have
used three categories, namely “port-towns”, “rail-connected towns and centres of
commercial agriculture”, and “highland towns”. The pattern that emerges from the data
presented in Table 5.3 is clear. The port cities and rail-linked towns grew most rapidly
during the period under consideration, while the development o f the commercially
isolated highland towns remained more limited.
More specifically,, the number of residential and commercial buildings in
Salonica and Kavala increased by 96.9% and 83.6%, respectively, from c. 1880-1907.
Likewise, the physical growth of rail-connected towns and centres o f commercial
agriculture increased by 50.0% and 52.8%, respectively, during the same period. The
expansion of highland towns was relatively modest, and the number of commercial and
residential buildings in these towns increased only by 11.8% and 19.0%, respectively.
This should come as no surprise. The concentration o f commercial activity and
the subsequent growth of the service and manufacturing industries in port-cities, rail
linked towns and in important centres o f commercial agriculture underlay their physical
expansion. Hundreds o f new shops, warehouses and other workshops were built to
physically accommodate the growing urban economies. Thousands of residential
buildings were erected to accommodate the growing urban population, and numerous
hotels, inns, restaurants, casinos, pubs and coffee houses were built to cater to the needs
of urban residents.

The 1907 estimates are from the 1907 yearbook. 2) Towns with an asterisk are the ones for which no observation was available for c.1880. In order to compensate for this deficiency I used the data contained in 1895 and 1896 yearbooks to roughly determine the number of buildings for each missing category. Also see Text. 3) The ‘Commercial Buildings’ include: Shops, warehouses, hotels (han and otel), public baths, restaurants, bakeries, casinos, workshops and coffee houses.
Likewise, in leading towns of the region, local municipalities and other public
and private bodies put considerable effort and resources into the modernisation of urban
infrastructures, which further added to the dynamism of construction activity in these
262


leading centres o f commerce. In this respect, the physical expansion of urban centres
and the growth o f urban economies appears to have been mutually reinforcing.
This structural link between commercialisation and the physical expansion of
towns becomes more important when we consider the relatively sluggish growth of
highland towns in the same period. In general, highland districts participated in the
commercial economy only in a very limited way. Their distance from railways and
major roads underlay the relative isolation of these towns. The highland economies
specialised mainly in animal husbandry, self-sufficient agricultural production, and
small-scale textile manufacturing. Under the circumstances, the highland towns could
not capitalise on the commercial opportunities that became readily available to the
leading centres of commercial agriculture, rail-linked towns and the port cities.
Consequently, the development of the urban construction sector also remained relatively
limited in the highland towns.47 The only exception to this was the highland town of
Nevrekop, which developed rapidly as an important centre of textile manufacturing and
became one of the leading towns of the region by the late 1900s. Notwithstanding the
example of Nevrekop, we can suggest that urban growth and the concomitant
development of the construction sector took place mainly along the coast-line, in low
land plains and along the valley systems, where commercial dynamism was more
pronounced and penetrating. The commercial dynamic underlining the physical growth
and development o f towns shall become more clear when we consider the case of
Selanik, which was the leading urban centre of the region by virtue of serving as a
gateway between a vast hinterland and the world economy.
3.2. The Growth of Salonica
In the mid-1870s, Salonica was already quite a sizeable port-town with an
estimated population o f 80,000 residents. The town grew steadily throughout the
following three decades and became one o f the leading “metropoles” of the eastern
Mediterranean basin, with a population of about 180,000 on the eve of the Balkan Wars.
47 However, note that the numbers of buildings in most o f the highway towns were missing in the yearbooks of 1876 and 1882. Therefore, I had to use the 1895 and 1896 data for 1880. As I have noted above, this method has somewhat inflated the 1880 figures for highland towns and understated the respective growth rates for the period under consideration. Yet, considering that the margin o f error could have been by as much as 10%, we could still suggest that the expansion of highland towns was relatively modest in comparison to port-cities and rail-connected towns.
263


The physical transformation of the town accompanied its demographic growth.
First, the number o f buildings increased considerably. In 1876, there were about 5,200
residential and 3,144 commercial buildings in Salonica. By 1907, these numbers had
risen to 9,694 and 5,633, respectively (See Table 5.3). Secondly, the entire face of the
town was transformed within a matter of four decades. Modem impressions and eclectic
interpretations o f many different (European) architectural styles gradually replaced local
ones. By 1910, the town also boasted quite extensive modem infrastructure outlets, such
as a sizeable commercial harbour, extensive quays that stretched along the waterfront,
wide avenues, paved streets, public gardens, railway and tram networks, as well as
extensive water, gas and electricity works. With all these modem features and eclectic
architectural decorum, Salonica inspired its residents and visitors to imagine it as a
fledging Paris, or rather a Marseilles in the Levant.48 This outcome represented a
relatively rapid process of urban growth and transformation, thanks to various agents
and forces that I shall discuss below.
In the late 1860s, the city o f Salonica was still circumscribed by the old city
walls. Construction o f residential and commercial buildings outside the old walls was
prohibited by imperial decree. This legal constraint withheld the physical expansion of
the city for decades and gave way to chronic overcrowding within the town.49 The
centrally located Jewish Quarter of the town was especially cramped; narrow, disorderly
and squalid streets barely separated the residential and commercial buildings.50 The city
walls obstructed sea-borne trade and compelled ships to load and discharge their
cargoes at a nearby location situated on the western side of the town.51
In 1870, the reformist governor general o f Selanik, Sabri Pa§a, convinced
Istanbul to consent to the demolition of the city walls and to the construction of new
buildings beyond the confines of the old city quarters. This was an important
development that changed the entire facade o f the town and allowed its rapid

expansion.52 The old city walls along the waterfront were demolished in the early
1870s.53 New houses, shops, bazaars, offices, hotels and warehouses were soon built
along the seashore, as well as within the old commercial centre of the town, the Frenk
Mahallesi.54 The town also rapidly expanded beyond the old city walls. The opening of
the Salomca-Uskup railway line in 1872 quickly transformed the west-end o f the town
into an important commercial centre. Numerous commercial buildings and warehouses
were constructed around the railway terminus situated in the Vardar Kapi Quarter.55
This neighbourhood initially grew also as a promising residential centre and many
houses were built between the old city walls and the railway terminal. Soon, however, it
became apparent that the marshes of the Vardar River constituted a grave inconvenience
for residents; the malicious attacks of mosquitoes, particularly at night, and the constant
risk o f malaria soon drove many residents away from the neighbourhood.56 Moreover,
the establishment o f a number o f factories in this spacious part o f the town created
further distress among the residents of the Vardar Kapi Quarter. The noise and pollution
caused by these factories ultimately forced many inhabitants to leave the neighbourhood
for alternative residences in the northern and especially the eastern end of the town.57
Eventually, residential development came to a halt and the entire west-end became one
of the leading commercial centres o f the town from the mid-1880s onwards.
Residential development took place mainly in the north and east ends of the
town. Following the Russo-Ottoman War of 1876, thousands of Muslim refugees
poured into the empire.58 Some of these refugees settled in the northern Muslim quarters
of the town.59 The Kalameriye Quarter in the north-east end of the town was another
52 Similar legislation enabled other port towns to expand rapidly beyond the old walls. The oftcited cases in point are the port-towns o f Kavala and Volos. See, Yeralimpos, ‘Tanzimat Doneminde Kuzey”. 5 3 P.P.A.P., 1871, V.29: 544. 54 P.P.A.P., 1874, V. 32: 670-672; P.P.A.P., 1874, V.33: 953. 55 F.O.A.S., 1888, N. 394: 6-7. 56 1307 S.V.S., 1890, 90.
52 it is interesting to note that the residents o f the Vardar Kapi Quarters o f Salonica resisted the establishment o f the Torres spinning factory in the early 1880s. The residents were concerned about the residents was the pollution and noise that the factory would cause. However, the case was resolved in favour o f the Torres family; the Chamber o f Commerce and the municipality supported the entrepreneur families and the factory was eventually established in the Vardar Kapi quarter as initially planned.

residential centre that grew rapidly in the 1880s. The old walls in this part of the city,
too, were demolished, and the twelve hectare estate of a Muslim notable, §eyh
Abdulkadir Efendi, was parceled out and sold to new settlers. In the early 1880s, a new
development plan brought an additional 150 hectares into use in the north-eastern part
of the town.60 Numerous villas and spacious residential dwellings mushroomed in
Kalameriye, and the neighbourhood soon became one of the most fashionable parts of
the town.61 In 1887, the south-eastern walls of the town were demolished and a new
avenue, the Hamidiye Caddesi, was built,, connecting the neighbouring Hamidiye
Quarter directly to the city of Salonica. Similar to the Kalameriye, the Hamidiye
Quarter developed rapidly to accommodate handsome residential buildings. European
residents and diplomatic envoys working in Salonica moved to this part of the town.62
Meanwhile, considerable infrastructure construction was taking place in
Salonica. The construction of the quays along the waterfront was the largest and the
most costly project. Raising the necessary capital to finance it initially posed a serious
challenge for the local government and municipal authorities. To overcome the
difficulty, the authorities soon came up with a brilliant idea. They auctioned the land
that would be reclaimed from the sea upon the completion of the quay walls. Both
European and local speculators showed immediate interest in the auctions and parceled
out the most valuable land stretching along the coastline. Within a matter of few
months, the local government had raised almost O.L. 100,000 from the auction.63 An
Italian company took over the construction o f the quay walls. The works commenced in
1871 and were close to completion by the summer o f 1874. However, later in the same
year, the works came to an abrupt halt due to the exhaustion of funds. The full
completion of this project had to wait until 1882.64
Other main avenues of the town, namely the Vardar, Kalameriye, Islahhane and
Midhat Pa§a Avenues, were enlarged and repaired.65 In addition, the municipality

By the end of the 1880s, at least a quarter of the streets in the town was paved with lava
stone imported from Bandirma and Napoli.66 Masonry was of high quality and due
attention was paid to “secure good drainage traps at the centre o f cross streets, with a
slight inclination for the water fall”.67 British Consul General Blunt reported in 1889,
that “Salonica had the best paved streets in Turkey”.68
In 1890, a disastrous fire broke out in the Jewish and Frenk Quarters of the town
and wiped out a third o f the old city. 1,560 houses were burnt to ashes within a matter of
few hours, leaving 10,000 people homeless.69 This was a crucial twist of fate that
entirely changed the face o f the town in the following years. The quarters destroyed by
the fire were rebuilt. This time, however, the construction was carried out according to a
plan drawn out by the local municipality. Wide avenues, orderly streets and new
intersecting squares soon replaced the disorderly and enclosed public spaces of the old
city.70 New multi-story residential buildings were built within the old Jewish Quarter.
The entire neighbourhood was transformed into one o f the most expansive areas of the
town, accommodating the spacious mansions of the city’s rising bourgeoisie. A similar
development took place in the Frenk Quarter. New passages and office buildings were
erected in the quarter. The merchant families of the town built their own business
centres. The most famous o f these were the Alatini, Savol, Tiyano, Yildiz, Saias,
Rongot and Lombardo business centres (harts). Thus, by the mid-1890 the Frenk
Quarter once again became a leading business centre.71
The development o f the town towards its western and eastern ends continued
throughout the 1890s and the 1900s. In the Vardar Kapi end of the town, new factories
and warehouses were built. In the east, residential development continued rapidly. After
the fire, the local government and the representatives of the Jewish community helped
resettle the displaced Jewish residents of the town in the Kalameriye Quarter and the

79 According to one estimate, the share of public spaces in the town area increased from 17% to 29% following die fire o f 1890 (Yeralimpos, “Tanzimat Doneminde Kuzey,” 50). Also, the construction o f streets was impressive. The municipality built a total of 99,504 square meters o f pavements in the town in 1893 alone (1310 S.V.S., 1893, 208). 7 ^ 1312 S.V.S., 1895, 192; Yeralimpos, “Tanzimat Doneminde Kuzey,” 50-51.

northern side of the Hamidiye Quarter.72 Also, the Hamidiye and the associated Yalilar
neighbourhoods became increasingly popular among the prosperous families of the
town. With their extensive public gardens, wide avenues and well-planned and orderly
streets, the Hamidiye and Yalilar Quarters soon became the suburbs of the town.73 Not
surprisingly, real estate speculators purchased sizeable parcels o f land in the east-end of
the town, forcing the land prices to increase exponentially. For instance, land prices rose
from one kuru§ per ar§in in 1901 to 25 kuru§ts in 1905 in the most distant parts of the
Yalilar Quarter.74
Real estate development continued also along the coastline. Two developments
were particularly striking in this period. The first was the construction o f the new
commercial harbour. An imperial decree issued on November 31, 1887, granted to the
Civil List the concession for the construction of a commercial port in Salonica. Despite
the pressing need for the construction of a new harbour and a spacious customs house,
no action was taken until the mid-1890s. The delay probably emanated from a lack of
funds. The active resistance of the influential guild of porters, that had quite literally
monopolised the handling of goods at the port o f Salonica, also hampered the
commencement o f harbour works for quite a while.75 On July 20, 1896, the ministers of
the Civil List finally signed a contract with a French entrepreneur, Edmond Bartissol,
for the construction o f a commercial harbour in Salonica. According to the contract, the
harbour works were to be completed within the following five years. The entire project
would cost £260,000. A fifth o f the sum was to be advanced by the Civil List and the
rest was to be financed by the contractor company, Societe ottomane de Construction du
Port de Salonique. The company was granted the right to exploit the port for five
years.76 Following a brief period of logistical and financial build up, the construction
work commenced in 1897.77 A number of technical and financial difficulties caused
delays in the actual construction process, but the harbour was finally completed in
1903.78

The second development in infrastructure was the enlargement of the quays. The
rising volume of trade in Salonica and the increasing public traffic in the town were
causing serious congestion along the quays. Goods discharged from the small boats lay
along the quay walls and often occupied even the adjacent avenues, obstructing
pedestrian and carriage traffic. After the arrival of tramways in 1893 (see below), the
congestion along the quays became intolerable. The Civil List soon took steps to expand
the quays in order to solve the problem. In 1899, the authorities approached the harbour
construction company. The project on offer involved the widening of the quays from 12
to 24 meters along the coastal strip that stretched between Olympos square and the
White Tower. The harbour company welcomed the offer and estimated the cost of the
project at O.L. 34,000.79 Following intense bargaining, the harbour company and the
representatives of the Civil List finally agreed upon a substantially lower budget of O.L.
11,000.80 Necessary capital would be provided from the Privy Purse, and the Civil List
would reserve all rights after the completion of the project. The works commenced in
1904.81 and the reconstruction of the entire quay line, was completed probably by
1908.82
Other important infrastructure developments took place throughout the 1890s
and the 1900s. The most important projects were the construction of quite
comprehensive water, gas and electricity networks and the foundation of a tram service
that cut through the town from the west-end to the east.
Prior to the mid-1880s, the city did not possess a comprehensive water
distribution scheme. The residents mainly relied on underground waters and used wells
to meet their needs. In addition, two small streams passing through the town were the
primary sources o f fresh running water. However, the streams were far from sufficient
for the needs of the town, and chronic water shortages affected the city, especially in

dry summer seasons. The rapid growth of the town population aggravated the water
supply bottlenecks from the 1870s onwards.83
In 1888, a prominent notable of Salonica, Nemlizade Hamdi Efendi, received the
concession to carry water from the Vardar River to Salonica and to construct water
wells in the hilly northern quarters o f the town.84 Another notable from Karaferye, Talib
Aga, was granted the concession to build a canal to bring fresh running water from the
nearby Kel Baba and §eyh Suyu streams over to the Kalameriye end of the town. Talib
Aga completed this project successfully in the late 1880s, and a regular 20-30 mesuro
water supply for the town was thus guaranteed. Within this scheme, Talib Aga also built
a public fountain in Kalameriye Quarters to serve the needs o f local population.85 The
commencement o f the much larger Vardar project had to wait until 1891. In 1890,
Hamdi Efendi ceded the concession to Ottomane des Eaux de Salonique, which was a
joint stock company founded by a group of Belgian capitalists with an initial capital of
5,000,000 French francs. Subsequently, the Water Company and the Ottoman
government signed a contract on January 12, 1891. The contract secured the
management rights o f the Water Company for fifty-one years in return for the
construction of the project.86 Construction started in 1891 and the water canals were
completed by 1893. The water was first brought from the Vardar plain to the
waterworks situated near the Be§9inar public gardens in the west side o f the city. The
water was then pumped by, steam power to the reservoirs situated in the upper part of
the city and from there distributed to the entire city. The contractor company built five
hydrants and seven public fountains along with the main distributary channels.87
Extensions, improvements and repairs on the waterworks continued until the end
of the period. The Water Company became the main supplier o f fresh drinking water to
Salonica. Although complaints concerning the pricing policy of the Water Company
were voiced in city circles, the new network made life easier for the Salonicans.88 The
service also improved the sanitary conditions in a city where epidemics o f cholera,

typhus, and chronic diarrhoea, all emanating from contaminated water, had claimed the
lives o f many adults and infants in the past.89
The second important infrastructure project was the construction of gasworks in
the town. In 1887, the imperial government granted a concession to a British subject, Sir
Kirby, to build and manage gas works in Salonica for thirty-five years. Later that year,
Sir Kirby sold the concession to a French company, Societe du Gas, which implemented
the entire project in a short time.90 The company began to lay the first pipes along the
streets o f Salonica in 1889, and the actual gas distribution started in 1890. Construction
proceeded rapidly in the following few years. By the mid-1890s, most streets of the
town had been illuminated by gas lamps.91 The gas works continued to expand steadily
throughout the following decade. In some years, the works had to be suspended due to
lack o f funds. Still, the expansion of the network continued well into the late 1900s,
thanks to the timely credits that the local banks extended to the construction company.92
Another important infrastructure development of the 1890s was the construction
o f an extensive tram network in the town. We see, once again, a local Muslim notable,
Hamdi Bey, behind the tram project. Hamdi Bey was granted a concession to build and
run tram lines in the town of Salonica on 11 September, 1889.93 In 1892, a joint stock
company, Compagnie ottomane des Tramways de Salonique, was established in
Belgium to raise the necessary capital. Once Hamdi Bey and his Belgian associates
secured a capital of 15,000,000 French francs, they launched the project. Under the
direction of Monsieur Kaul, an engineer from Luxembourg, the construction proceeded
quickly. By mid-1893, half of the projected network was completed. Within that year,
tram services commenced. In the first six months, the trams carried 779,847 passengers,
and the company earned about 4,000 French francs in profits. Next year, the entire 8.8
km-long network was completed, connecting the east and west ends of the town. The

company was a success from this point on. Passenger numbers reached 4,000,000 and
the annual profits rose to 41,000 French francs in the late 1890s and the early 1900s.94
The development of the east-end, particularly of the Hamidiye Quarter, soon
brought about the need to extend the tram services beyond the White Tower. The
construction of a new four-kilometre line that connected the White Tower to the Depot
located at the outskirts of the Hamidiye Quarter commenced in 1897. The Tram
Company completed the project within three years, and new trams started running along
the Hamidiye Boulevard in 1900.95 Meanwhile, services on existing lines improved. The
number o f carriages running through the town at rush hours increased.96 New late night
and early morning trams were put into service. New seats were added to carriages to
secure the privacy o f Muslim women. Also, due care was taken to improve the
punctuality o f the services.97 In 1904, a new project was initiated to build a second tram .
track along the quay with a view to increasing the flow o f services between the railway
terminus and the White Tower.98 This project proceeded rapidly and was probably
completed in 1905.99 Yet, the trams could still not keep up with the rapid growth o f the
town population. Municipal authorities considered alternative measures that would help
alleviate the problem o f public transportation. In 1905, the growing need for new
electric trams for the town was voiced for the first time in city circles.100 Later in that
year, the Societe ottomane d ’Electricite de Salonique et Smyme was established in
Istanbul to set up the first electricity works and to run the trams on electricity in Izmir
and Salonica. This company, too, brought together a group of Belgian capitalists led by
Mr. Barlett and influential Ottomans, including Ziya Pa§a, who successfully obtained
the necessary concession from the central government and raised the due capital in
Europe toward the realisation of the project.101

In 1906, a group of engineers from Belgium arrived Salonica.102 Following
preliminary investigations and planning, the engineers ordered the importation of the
necessary equipment from Belgium. The engineers soon completed the project and the
first electric tram started running along the streets o f Salonica in June of 1907.103 The
Tram Company also provided electricity for the town. In 1908, apart from several
private consumers, three theatres and the Alatini Flour Mill were illuminated by
electrical power. The next year, three main avenues as well as a few principal cafes
situated around the Olympos Square and the seashore were lit by electricity.104

All these projects reflect the prosperity, technical modernisation and the material
improvements that affected the lives of Salonicans. Clearly, a considerable amount of
wealth accumulated in Salonica during the period under consideration. As we have seen,
the Ottoman government was partly responsible for the flow o f wealth into the town.
The Civil List and the local municipality played an important role in providing the
necessary capital for some of the infrastructure projects. However, the bulk of the
capital that poured into the city appears to have originated from local mercantile classes,
notables and European capitalists.
In order to better demonstrate the interests o f these agents in urban real estate
development, I present a brief list o f some of the prominent real estate owners in
102 Asir, 25.Z.1324 (19.2.1906), N. 1052: 2. 103 Asir, 25.Za.1325 (7.1.1907), N. 1144: 1-2; F.O.A.S., 1909, N. 4359: 7.

Salonica around 1910 in Appendix 6. The data are extracted from an Ottoman tax ledger
that contains information on the fiscal liabilities of the real estate in question. The
ledger is far from being exhaustive, but it reveals useful information on the involvement
of notables and mercantile classes in urban real estate development. For instance, the
common presence o f Muslim proprietors, who carry the prestigious titles of pa§a, aga
and bey, point to the heavy involvement of wealthy notables and individuals in urban
real estate development. The frequent appearance o f Muslim women with the
prestigious title of hamm in the list, likewise, confirms the preoccupation of wealthy
Muslim families in real estate business. The frequent appearance of certain Jewish and,
Greek family names on the list indicate that the town’s ethnically mixed elite shared the
costs as well as the benefits of real estate development in Salonica.
Handsome returns appear to have been the main attraction o f urban real estate
development in Salonica. The above mentioned data also reveal some useful, and quite
unique, information on the annual average yield of various types o f real estate in
Salonica. According to the data, the annual rent income that an average building
generated in Salonica could reach 18.0% of the estimated value of the building. More
specifically, residential buildings yielded an. annual rent income that equalled average
15.0% of the actual estimated value of the property, while the same figure for
commercial buildings was 19.0%. If this information is accurate, then real estate
ownership emerges as a relatively profitable and secure investment option. For example,
the leading firms and banks located in Salonica paid between 4-10.0% in dividends,
every year in the late 1900s (See Table 5.4). Between 1886-1914, the average effective
annual rate o f interest on government bonds was 5.5%. The Agricultural Bank charged
7.0% interest on loans extended to farmers. Money lending and tax farming were
profitable investments that could yield as much as 30-40.0% of profit per annum.105Yet,
money lending and tax farming involved serious risks.106 These comparative figures
indicate that real estate ownership in Salonica was probably one o f the most lucrative
and presumably the least risky of all investment options that were available to people of
economic prominence in the region. This attractiveness o f real estate development
undergirded the physical growth of Salonica and other towns.

European capitalists showed considerable interest in real estate development.
They were involved, to some extent, in the construction of commercial and residential
buildings. Even more so, they participated in infrastructure projects, such as the
construction of the commercial harbour, quays, gas and water works and trams. All the
projects carried out by European capitalists, without exception, yielded handsome
returns for the investors. These returns underlay European interest in infrastructure
projects. Also, the constant struggle between the European powers to establish a strong
foothold in the Balkans set the political and strategic backdrop against which these
infrastructure outlets proceeded in the region. In this context, the predominance of
French, Belgian and especially Austrian capital in infrastructure outlets illustrates the
political and strategic nature of European presence in the region.107
The physical development of Salonica, then, can be associated with a number of
interlocking structural processes at work. First, the moment o f “peripherisation”
encompassed the entire process of urban growth and the rapid development of the
construction industry in Salonica. The concentration of commercial activity in this
important port-city o f the Levant constituted the broad historical backdrop against
which the construction industry grew. The construction industry expanded rapidly to
accommodate physically the town’s commercial and demographic growth. Secondly,
the efforts to modernise the city fuelled the growth of the urban construction industry.
The construction of wide avenues, paved streets, water, gas and electricity works,
modem transport systems, as well as the emergence of new eclectic architectural styles
in the town marked this development. Thirdly, the local elite seems to have responded
swiftly to the emergent opportunities provided by the interlocking processes of
“peripherisation” and “modernisation”. Local mercantile classes and prominent notables
assumed active initiative in real estate development. They invested considerable sums of
capital in the construction of both residential and commercial buildings. The primary
motive behind this interest in real estate development was apparently the returns
accruing from such investments. However, the prestige and power that came with
ownership o f real estate in urban areas too must have moved the elite. The proliferation
of luxurious mansions, kiosks and other stylish buildings owned by prominent

275


individuals testify to this lavish interest in prestige and power. Probably similar
economic and political concerns incited European capitalists to invest considerably in
real estate development in Salonica, although the economic motives seem to have been
more important in their case.
4. The Growth and Transformation of the Manufacturing Industry
In the early 1870s, the region’s manufacturing base included artisanal shops that
specialised in the production o f textiles, household utensils, furniture, basic iron goods
and food processing.108 There were only a few “industrial” establishments in the region.
These establishments included a number of silk filatures, a few tanneries, a steam
engined flourmill, and a soap factory.109 The products of these artisanal and “industrial”
concerns were consumed largely within the region. The exceptions were the specialty
textile products, specifically the famed heavy woollen cloth (§ayak), silken bath towels
(pe§temal) and silken veils (<biiriimcuk), which were in demand also in the Ottoman and
Levantine markets.110 The urban manufacturing industries of the region, then, were
typically characterised by small scale artisanal production based on simple technology
on the one hand, and a high degree of concentration on products sold in the immediate
consumer markets, on the other. Mechanisation and production with a view to acquiring
a larger share for the intra-regional and international markets remained limited. Intense
European competition, technical difficulties encountered in the introduction, adaptation
and maintenance of imported technology and, last but not the least, risk averse
entrepreneurial behaviour undergirded relative isolation and the technological
limitations of the urban manufacturing sector.111

276


The late nineteenth century, however, appears as a period of growth, deepening
and diversification for the manufacturing industry.112 It is very difficult to measure the
growth performance of the sector during these years. Available output figures provide
only limited information on a few leading industries, mainly textiles, and are silent on
many important branches of the sector.113 Besides, available data is often cross-sectional
and do not allow a systematic long-term analysis.114 Thus, it is necessary to find an
alternative proxy to help us establish the broad trends in sectoral performance.
Changes in the number of industrial establishments operating in the region can
illustrate the development o f the sector. This proxy can also enable us to surmise the
changing composition o f manufacturing production in time. The proxy in question,
however, has certain drawbacks. First, it cannot fully account for the variations in the
size o f industrial establishments and therefore cannot fully account for the contribution
o f each establishment to the performance of the manufacturing sector at large. Second,
it is not sensitive to changes taking place in the level o f productivity in different
branches o f the manufacturing sector. Therefore, it is necessary to maintain a critical
distance to the implied results o f the proxy variable. Yet, the exercise, as we shall see, is
useful in reaching certain conclusions o f a more general nature.
Table 5.5 presents the number o f industrial establishments operating in the
region in ten-year intervals between 1880 and 1910. The data pertaining to 1880 are
based on the contributions o f Gounaris, Quataert and Palairet and incorporate industrial
establishments that existed in the region during the 1870s.115 As it is, the data set is
somewhat incomplete, because it does not include a number of factories that actually

existed at the time but went unrecorded in available sources. An unknown number of
silk filatures and iron works situated in Salonica, a few mechanised flour mills operating
in Karaferye, Avrethisan, Vodine, Drama and Agustos are cases in point. Therefore, the
1880 estimates do not fully represent the number of mills operating in the region and
must be considered an under-representation by at least 20 establishments.116
The data set pertaining to 1890 is based on the provincial yearbook of that year,
which provides a detailed list o f the factories operating in the region.117 I have added to
the numbers reported in the official yearbook an additional textile concern, one ice
factory, four chair manufactures, a machinery repairs workshop and three macaroni
factories, which are cited in British consular reports and also mentioned by Quataert,
Gounaris and Palairet.118
The data for 1900 are based mainly on the relatively comprehensive 1890
estimates. In estimating the number of establishments in 1900,1 simply controlled for
the opening and closure o f industrial establishments during the 1890s and adjusted the
1890 numbers accordingly, by adding or subtracting, the respective observations.
Otherwise, I assumed that' the industrial profile did not significantly change over time
and carried the 1890 values over to 1900. I extracted the information about factory
openings and closures from contemporary sources that reported such activity, namely,
the provincial yearbooks, British consular reports, and the existing secondary literature.
In addition, I referred to Ottoman archival sources, especially the State Council (§ura-yi
Devlet) and the Imperial Decree (Irade) collections, the local newspaper Asir, and the
journal o f the French Chamber of Commerce o f Istanbul, Revue Commerciale du
Levant.
Gounaris, Steam Over Macedonia, 136. For instance, we know that there were about 18 silk, filatures operating in Salonica in 1874 (E. Themopoulou, Salonique, 1800-1875: Conjoncture Economique et Mouvement Commercial, Unpublished Ph.D. diss., (Paris: Universite de Paris I, PantheonSorbonne, 1994), 459). However, it is not exactly clear how many filatures existed in c.1880. Quataert maintains that there were only two filatures operating in Salonica and an additional six operating in the nearby villages in the late 1880s (Quataert, “Premieres fumees d’usines,” 164). The 1890 Ottoman provincial yearbook cites only four silk concerns in Salonica (1307 S.V.S., 1890, 230-231). Therefore, it is difficult to exactly point out the number of filatures operating in the towns as o f 1880. Hence, I decided to keep silk filatures out o f our data set for c.1880. Similarly, according to the 1890 yearbook, there were about 12 flour mills operating in numerous towns other than Salonica, i.e. two in Vodine, one in Drama, one in Sari-§aban, one in Kavala, one in Longaza, four in Karaferye, and two in Agustos, (1307 S.V.S., 1890, 230-231). Their number in c.1880 is not exactly clear, so I left these establishments too out o f my computations. Thus, including the iron workshops etc. in Salonica, I have possibly excluded a total of 20 establishments for c.1880. 117 1307 S.V.S., 1890: 230-231.
278


Finally, the 1910 estimates are based on a British consular report dated 1911.
The report includes a list of industrial establishments operating in the leading urban
centres of the region.1191 adjusted the British data to account for the new establishments
and a number o f closures that the consular report apparently overlooked. Thus, I.
estimated the number o f industrial establishments on a cross sectional basis for four
benchmark years.
Another difficulty, encountered in the process of data compilation was to
determine what an industrial establishment, or a “factory” proper, really entailed during
the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In both Ottoman and European
sources, there was no clear indication as to the definition of a factory. Often, the
identification of a workplace as a factory was not disputable. The food processing and
textile mills that utilised steam power and employed tens and hundreds of workers could
be legitimately termed as factories. Similarly, large workshops, such as the tobacco
processing concerns that employed hundreds of workers, could be justifiably
categorised as factories. However, there was also a grey zone of manufacturing
concerns that stood very close to artisanal workshops. This grey zone included such,
workplaces as oil presses, small tanneries, flour mills, smaller brick and tile works,
numerous distilleries and small workshops producing iron goods. In order not to inflate
the estimates, I excluded this latter group of workplaces in my “factory” category.120 In
other words, I included only the sizeable and relatively mechanised establishments in
my calculations.121 This methodological choice enhanced consistency within the data
set.
F.O.A.S., 1886, N. 24: 6-7; Quataert “Premieres fumees d’usines,” 165; Gounaris Steam Over Macedonia, 135-138; Palairet, The Balkan Economies, 346-352. 119 F.O.A.S., 1912, N. 5017:4.
1^® The only exception to this were the large tanneries situated in Salonica, Vodine and Kavala, which are cited in the 1911 British consular report.
121 In the 1913-1915 industrial survey the definition o f a ‘factory’ included flour mills capable, o f grinding 100 quintals of grain within 24 hours, soap factories employing at least 10 workers, mechanised factories employing at least 10 workers, and non-mechanised factories employing more than 20 workers. Our definition is not as clear-cut. Yet, by excluding the smaller workplaces, I have improved the comparability o f the data set with the 1913-1915 survey.

Table 5.5 points to the dynamism of the region’s industrial manufacturing
sector. First, the last row maintains the growth of the region’s urban industrial base
between 1880 and 1910. More specifically, there was a minimum of ten, and possibly
thirty, industrial establishments in the region in the 1880s. On the eve of the Balkan
Wars, the estimated number of factories had increased to 148. This basic observation
280


leaves little doubt about the growth o f industrial production in the region during the
period under consideration.
Secondly, the data indicate the growing diversification of industrial production
in the Selanik region. In the early 1880s, the existing industrial establishments in
Selanik included flourmills, cotton spinning mills, silk filatures, and a few other
consumer goods industries. In contrast, the region’s industrial base included mechanised
weaving concerns, flannel, underwear and shirting factories, and a number of
establishments producing a variety o f basic consumer goods, such as macaroni,
beverages, ice, shoes, and tobacco products in the early 1910s. In addition, local
entrepreneurs established numerous sweatshops producing iron goods, cutlery and
furniture and a number of tobacco processing factories and silk reeling concerns.
In what follows, I will discuss the underlying dynamics of this growth process,
focusing on a) demand side conditions, b) factor costs, and c) entrepreneurship.
4.1. Dynamics of Industrial Growth and the Rise of the Factory System
4.1.1. Demand Side Factors
Favourable demand side conditions underlay the growth of industrial production
in Selanik. First, domestic demand for certain consumer goods and construction
materials increased quite notably during the period. Two processes of structural,
transformation underlay the expansion o f the domestic demand. First, the growing tide
of urbanisation generated fresh demand for basic consumer goods, processed foodstuffs,
beverages and other items for immediate consumption. Likewise, the physical growth of
cities and the proliferatipn of the urban construction industry generated additional
demand for certain materials, such as nails, bricks, tiles, iron frames and fittings.
Second, the growth o f commercial agriculture, especially o f tobacco production, led to a
rise in disposable cash income of the farming communities, particularly after the turn of
the century.122 Subsequently, the local demand for manufactured consumer goods
expanded even further, as cash crop producers became detached from subsistence
farming and increasingly involved in the broader circuit of commodity exchange.
122 See Chapter 2, the section on tobacco production.
281


Imports from overseas probably absorbed a good portion of this fresh demand.
As I have discussed above, imports grew steadily during the period under consideration.
Such imported goods as textiles and certain foodstuffs captured a commanding position
in the expanding domestic markets, owing much to the aggressive marketing strategy of
foreign trading houses and the expansion of credit networks throughout the region.
However, the rapid expansion of domestic demand worked also to the advantage of
local manufacturing industries, especially in the low value added consumer goods and
in commodities that directly appealed to local tastes. Indeed, the manufactured goods
produced in local factories were consumed predominantly within the region. Take, for
instance, the cotton spinning concerns of Salonica, Vodine, Karaferye and Agustos.
Local artisanal and mechanised weaving concerns, as well as peasant women weaving
cloth within the confines of the rural household economy, consumed the coarse yam
spun in these cotton mills.123 Likewise, the cotton and woollen weaving manufacturers
and the ready made cloth and footwear industries sold their products in both regional
and in growing urban, markets. All foodstuffs and beverages were consumed locally.124
Likewise, the soap factories catered exclusively to local demand.125 The industrial
sectors linked to the booming construction industry also sold their products primarily in
regional markets.126
Some consumer and construction goods industries, however, managed to expand
their market reach beyond the region and sold their products in other Ottoman markets.
For instance, the local cotton spinning concerns traded regularly with interior
Macedonia, Albania, Anatolia, and the Aegean Islands.127 Similarly, the famous
Olympos brewery in Salonica marketed its beer also in Istanbul and Izmir.128 The local

tile and brick factories, especially the large concern owned by the Alatini family, sold
their products in Izmir, Istanbul and Rhodes.129
The apparent expansion of intra-regional trade in these products can be
associated with two processes. First, the demand dynamic generated by the rapid growth
o f such leading towns of the Levant as Izmir and Istanbul appears to have provided an
important pull-factor that created ample opportunities for local industrialists. Second,
the gradual abolition o f internal customs duties during the late 1870s and the late 1880s
was a crucial development that enabled local manufacturers to take advantage o f the
opportunities offered by the neighbouring consumer markets o f the Levant.130
Another source of demand for manufactured goods, particularly for textiles and
processed foodstuffs was the Ottoman state itself. From the 1840s onwards the
Bulgarian textile industry was the primary supplier of woollen §ayak and aba cloths for
the Ottoman army. However, following the Russo-Ottoman War o f 1876 and Bulgaria’s
subsequent autonomy, the Ottoman army withdrew its orders from Bulgaria. The
Bulgarian woollen textile industry went into a period o f crisis,131 but this situation
created new opportunities for Ottoman woollen textile manufacturers. The weavers of
Selanik, who had for centuries been manufacturing a variety of woollen cloths for both
civil and military consumption, soon became an important supplier of woollen cloth for
the Ottoman army. The bulk of woollen cloth production took place within the context
of artisanal manufacturing.132 However, it is important to note here that the lucrative
sale of woollen textiles to the army encouraged a number of entrepreneurs to establish
mechanised weaving concerns in the region. In 1904, a §ayak factory was opened in
Siroz. In 1906 an integrated woollen textile mill was established in Salonica and another
concern was set up in Agustos next year. Finally, in 1911, a group of Jewish
entrepreneurs established a large mill in Salonica, catering exclusively to army
orders.133 Thus, the extra demand generated by the Ottoman army undergirded the
129 F.O.A.S., 1910, N. 4579: 12, F.O.A.S., 1911, N. 4797: 11.
130 F.O.A.S., 1889, N. 623: 9; Asir, 23.Ca.1314 (30.10.1896), N. 121: 1. Internal customs duties on goods to be transported overland within the Empire were abolished earlier in 1878. In 1889, the charges on goods to be transported over sea routes were abolished entirely. See §. Pamuk, Osmanli Ekonomisinde Bagimhhk ve Biiyume, [Dependency and Growth in the Ottoman Economy], (Istanbul: Tarih Vakfi Yaymlan, 1994), 130-131. 131 Palairet, The Balkan Economies, 70-73, 82,189-196. 132 See Section 4.2. below.

expansion of the mechanised woollen textile industry in the region, especially after the
turn of the century.
The provision of flour and other foodstuffs for the local armies also created
certain opportunities for industrialists. The third army corps stationed in the
Macedonian provinces included about 75,000 soldiers.134 At the time, the average
Ottoman soldier was given a daily ration of 960 grams o f bread.135 This meant that each
soldier consumed on the average 350 kilograms o f bread annually. The total bread
consumption of the entire third army corps, therefore, could reach up to 26,000 tons.
This was a considerable amount and required the regular provision of about 20,000 tons
of flour for the army annually. The leading cereal merchants of Salonica, the Alatini
brothers, conducted the bulk of this lucrative business in army provisions. The Alatini
brothers processed army provisions in their large flourmill in Salonica. Prominent
notables also held a considerable stake in provisioning; some owned their own flour
mills and processed and packed the produce before forwarding the flour over to the
military barracks.136
Finally, the growth of cash crop production had a propulsive impact on
industrialisation, as witnessed by the rapid growth of the silk reeling and tobacco
processing industries. As it has been discussed in Chapter 2, the appearance of the
malignant pebrine disease in Salonica and its environs led to an unprecedented decline
in regional silk production from the mid-1850s onwards. The collapse of sericulture, in
turn, forced numerous silk reeling concerns out of business in the 1860s and the 1870s.
According to contemporary estimates, there were about 35 mechanised silk filatures in
Salonica that employed a total of 2,000 workers in the mid-1840s. By the late 1860s,
there were only 15 filatures employing about 1,000 workers.137 The contraction of the
sector continued throughout the 1870s. In the early 1880s, there remained only two
filatures operating in Salonica and another six filatures operating in nearby villages.138

136 por example, the Ismail Pa§a, who was a leading contractor for the army, owned a large flour mill in the district o f Ko?ana in the neighbouring province o f Kosova (1318 K.V.S., 1901,484). 137 E. Themopoulou, Salonique, 459. 138 Quataert, “Premieres fumees d’usines,” 160-162.
284


The silk reeling industry made a notable recovery following the successful
containment o f the pebrine disease and the subsequent recovery in sericulture from the
1880s onwards.139 Gevgeli emerged as the primary centre o f silk reeling. Ottoman
provincial yearbooks report no silk concerns in Gevgeli in the late-1880s, but the 1895
yearbook reports 18 filatures operating in the town.140 In 1907, there were a total of 28
silk concerns in Gevgeli alone.141 By 1910, a total of 32 filatures were operating in the
entire Selanik region.
Most of the silk concerns were privately owned. However, the Ottoman Public
Debt Administration (PDA) set up at least three model filatures in the region during the
1890s, one near Salonica, the other in Vodine, and the third in Gevgeli.142 The Gevgeli
plant was the largest of these filatures. It was installed with the most up-to-date
technology and boasted 60 reels capable of producing 8,000 kilograms of raw silk
annually.143 Unfortunately, this factory closed down in 1899, due to prohibitive energy
costs resulting from technical flaws and poor management.144 At any rate, these
factories set an example and encouraged the establishment of new silk-reeling concerns
throughout the region.
Likewise, the tobacco processing industry grew rapidly during the period under
consideration. The growth of the tobacco trade from the mid-1880s onwards had a
propulsive impact on tobacco processing. In 1888, the tobacco Regie set up a tobacco
factory in Salonica to process tobacco and to produce cigarettes and other tobacco
139 See Chapter 2 for the recovery and growth of sericulture in Selanik. 140 1313 S.V.S., 1895, 290. 141 1324 S.V.S., 1907, 334.
142 BA, §D-Maliye, 368/51, 28.B.1314 (2.1.1897); BA, §D-Maliye, 378/42, 20.Ca.1316 (6.10.1898). 143 Asir, 3.R.1314 (11.9.1896), N. 107: 2.
144 Asir, 2.Za.l319 (10.2.1902), N. 657: 1. Usually the closure o f the PDA filature in Gevgeli is linked to rising wages (Quataert, “Premieres fumees d’usines,” 164). However, contemporary Ottoman reports point to certain technical difficulties as the primary cause o f the factory’s closure. The factory was initially designed for 120 reels and the machinery, especially the boilers, were installed accordingly. However, due to reasons unknown to us, only 60 reels were installed and had to be operated on boilers adjusted to the requirements o f 120 reels. This technical mismatch inflated the energy costs and coal expenses averaged as high as 60 francs per day. In addition, excessive remuneration o f the managers, clerks and engineers further inflated operational costs and ultimately forced the factory into closure in 1899. A sum o f O.L. 1,000 was necessary to undertake the technical adjustments that would render the factory economically feasible. However, neither the PDA nor any other private agent made an effort to reinvest in the mill. Probably, the downturn of global silk prices discouraged both the private entrepreneurs and the PDA from putting more money into the factory. Thus, possibly the largest reeling concern o f the region was abandoned to idleness.
285


products.145 A few years later, the Regie set up another tobacco processing plant in
Gevgeli.146 In the early 1900s, the leading tobacco concerns operating in the region,
namely Commercial Co. and the Hertzog Co., established two more tobacco-processing
factories in Salonica.147 The densest concentration of tobacco processing plants was
probably in Kavala, Drama, Siroz and Yenice. We do not have detailed information on.
the number o f tobacco processing plants operating in these towns at the time, but we
know that about 20,000 workers were employed regularly in tobacco processing. It is
reasonable to assume on the basis o f this figure that there were a significant number of
small, medium and large-scale workshops in these leading centres of tobacco
production.148
Overall, the opportunities that emerged in regional and intra-regional markets
and the sustained demand generated by the Ottoman army, prepared the structural
ground for the growth of industrial production in the region. However, the underlying
dynamics o f this growth process cannot be explained entirely with reference to demand
side factors. Supply side dynamics, too, must be considered.
4.1.2. Factor Costs: Wages. Energy Costs and Raw Material Prices
Given the relatively liberal trade regime of the empire, the local manufacturing
industries would not have been able to compete with their. European counterparts, unless
they could maintain a competitive edge in pricing. In this regard, the region’s industrial
establishments seem to have enjoyed, at varying degrees and in certain periods, three
primary advantages, namely low wages, access to water streams and the availability of
cheap raw materials.
In the existing literature, the availability o f cheap labour is commonly
considered one of the primary reasons underlying the growth of the sector in Selanik.
u s F.O.A.S., 1893, N. 1310: 10-11. 146 QUataert, “Premieres fumees d’usines,” 164; Gounaris, Steam Over Macedonia, 140. 147 Asir, 10.Z.1319 (20.3.1902), N. 668: 2.
148 Asir, 10.Z.1319 (20.3.1902), N. 668: 2; 1320 S.V.S. (1903: 560, 566). Consider for instance the tobacco workshop owned by a certain Alexander Efendi in Siroz, which employed about 100 workers in 1903. Similarly, a certain Na§ohik Efendi was running a sizeable tobacco processing plant near Siroz which was in excellent condition and earning good returns (Asir, 3.Za.l320 (2.2.1903), N. 754: 2-3). No doubt there were similar cases in Drama, Kavala, and Yenice (R.C.£., 1907, N.238-243: 832-833, 991
286


However, there is also a tendency to suggest that the rise in urban wages, especially in
the town o f Salonica, somewhat arrested this dynamism, particularly after the turn of the
century. It is argued that the rise in urban wages led to a notable reorganisation, or
rather relocation, within regional manufacturing industries; that is to say that, industrial
growth came to a halt in Salonica and shifted increasingly towards such interior towns
as Agustos, Vodine, Karaferye and Gevgeli, where labour costs were relatively low.149
Indeed, labour costs were notably lower in the inland towns. No comprehensive
wage data is available. However, the scattered evidence at hand does allow for a
cautious analysis of wage differentials between Salonica and inland towns. For
example, in the late 1880s, young girls working in cotton spinning manufactures in
Yenice earned an average o f 4.5d.150 Likewise, unskilled female domestic servants and
cooks earned, on the average, 5.5d per day in the interior towns.151 Young girls working
in the cotton mills o f Salonica received an average wage of about 7.5d. The situation
was slightly better for senior workers, but a notable wage gap between Salonica and the
interior towns prevailed. For example, the relatively senior and skilled female spinners
received Is Id in Yenice and the most skilled, possibly senior, domestic servant
received 7.5d in the interior. Skilled female workers employed at the Regie's tobacco
factory in Salonica earned Is 4d, that is almost twice as much. Similar wage
differentials seem to have prevailed for male workers as well. Unskilled male labourers
earned 4.5d to 6.5d, or an average o f 5.5d, in the interior towns around 1890.152 This
wage rate was considerably lower than the wages received by young boys working in
the cotton mills of Salonica, who received anything between I d and lid , or an average
of 9d. In the early 1900s, the wage gap between Salonica and the interior towns was still
in place. For instance, in 1903, the unskilled workers employed in the tobacco
processing plant owned by Alexander Efendi in Siroz received 6.5d to Is 3d.153 Their
counterparts in Salonica got 1Id to Is 6d in 1906.
It is quite probable that this relative cost advantage, inter alia, constituted a
strong incentive for setting up industrial concerns in interior towns. Yet, in my opinion,

low urban wages underlay the overall process of industrial development throughout the
region, at least until the late 1900s. As I have noted above, since no comprehensive
wage series are available, it is not possible to quantify trends in urban wages with
accuracy. However, the scattered evidence at hand does suggest that local industrialists
benefited from the availability of cheap, unskilled labour in the region at large.
In 1873, the young girls working in a silk factory in Salonica were earning daily
wages between 10d and Is, or an average of lit/.154 In 1893, the relatively skilled
women employed in the tobacco Regie received Is to Is Ad, or an average o f Is 2d,
while the unskilled girls working in cotton mills received only Ad to 1Id, or an average
of 7.5t/.155 The wages o f skilled female workers stood around an average of Is 5d, while
the unskilled young girls received only an average o f 6.5d in 1906.156 If these
observations are representative of broad trends in the region, then we can suggest that
the nominal wages of skilled female labourers increased by as much as 20.0%. In
contrast, however, the nominal earnings of unskilled girls declined consistently, by as
much as 32% during 1873-1893, and another 13.3% during 1893-1906. It is more
difficult to determine real trends in female wages, for we lack a comprehensive cost of
living index for the Selanik' region. However, using Williamson’s cost of living indices
for the Ottoman Empire, we can determine broad trends in real wages.157 According to
Williamson’s estimates, the cost of living in the Ottoman Empire increased by 15.0%
between 1893-1906. If so, the real wages received by skilled female workers probably
increased only marginally by about 5.0%. In contrast, the earnings of the unskilled
women declined by as much as 25.5% during the 1890s and the 1900s.158
The conditions were not any better for unskilled male workers. Although they
received relatively higher wages in comparison to female workers, their nominal and
real earnings also declined steadily between the mid-1890s and the mid-1900s. In the
early 1890s, unskilled male labourers in cotton mills earned wages that ranged between
l<y 6d to 2s, or an average o f Is 9d, while young boys earned I d to \\d . In 1906,

unskilled male workers received somewhat lower wages at 1Id to Is 6d, or an average
of Is 3d, per day.159 Based on these scattered observations, we could maintain that the
nominal wages received by unskilled male workers, and possibly by young boys,
dwindled by about 29.0% during this reflationary period. In real terms, the decline could
well have been as much as 40.0%.160
The relatively privileged segment o f the work force, namely skilled male
workers, received considerably higher wages during the same period. In the mid-1870s,
skilled male labourers were earning something around Is 3d per day.161 A decade later,
their wages stood somewhere between Is 10d and 2s 11J, or an average of 2s 4.5d.162
After the mid-1890s, they started earning higher nominal wages. In 1905-6, for instance,
a skilled male worker would receive an average daily wage of 3s 3d.163 If so, we can
maintain that the wages o f a skilled male worker increased by 37.0% in nominal terms
between the mid-1880s and 1906. In real terms, the increase could well have been as
much as 28.0%.164
Based on this evidence, we can suggest that the industrial sector o f Salonica
benefited from the low and declining wages, especially those received by unskilled
labourers. As we have seen in the previous chapters, distressing economic and political
conditions in the countryside forced many dispossessed peasant proprietors out of
agricultural pursuits and compelled them to seek their fortunes in growing urban areas.
Likewise, many refugee families coming from the Balkans settled in urban areas under
the auspices o f the Ottoman government. This downcast and unskilled labour force,
together with the urban poor already residing in towns, constituted the backbone of the
working classes employed in the manufacturing industries. Most of these workers were
disorganised and had little bargaining power vis a vis the factory administrations.
Young women, girls, boys, and other unskilled male workers in particular were
158 ^ estimating the changes in real wages, I assumed that maximum wages received by female workers represented skilled workers. I also took the average of the wages received by unskilled girls. Finally I simply deflated nominal values by the Williamson estimates. 159 Quataert, “Premieres fumees d’usines,” 170.
160 Again, I used Williamson’s cost o f living index to deflate nominal wages. Accordingly I assumed that the cost o f living increased by 15% during the same period. 161 P.P.A.P., 1975, V. 34: 383.

vulnerable and could be disposed of and replaced by other unskilled workers at any
time. Under the circumstances, these unskilled workers were often compelled to accept
low wages, and were exploited to the extreme under highly distressing and unhygienic
conditions that prevailed in most factories.165 The intense exploitation of the
disorganised and downcast work force clearly bestowed industrialists with a
considerable advantage in cost effectiveness, during the 1890s and the early 1900s.
The skilled labourers posed greater problems for the local industrialists during
this period. As we have seen, this relatively privileged segment of the urban workforce,
especially the skilled male workers, received higher and increasing wages during the
period under consideration. This should not come as a surprise, because skilled
labourers were scarce and difficult to recruit under modem “factory” conditions. Under
the circumstances, the factory owners paid handsome wages to skilled workers to recruit
and employ them as machine operators, foreman and supervisors. However, even the
wages received by these skilled workers lagged behind their counterparts in Europe and
the Mediterranean basin. According to Williamson, Ottoman wages lagged seriously
behind their continental and many Mediterranean counterparts at least until the early
1900s. 166 In this respect, it is fair to suggest that in general low wages and highly
exploitative work conditions provided local industrialists with a cost advantage that
enabled them to resist the tide o f foreign competition in domestic markets.
After the mid-1900s, however, a series of organised strikes hit the
manufacturing centres o f the region, especially Salonica. The liberal political
atmosphere generated 1908 revolution and the gradual erosion of real wages in the
previous decades, triggered industrial action in most parts of the region in 1908.167 The
strikes were successful in most instances. They managed to receive considerable wage
164 According to Williamson Ottoman cost o f living increased by a modest 6,8% between 1885 and 1906 (Williamson, “Real Wages and Relative,” 10). I used these estimates to deflate the nominal values cited in the text, i.e. average of 2s 4.5d for c.1885 and 35 3d c. 1905.
165 For the condition of working classes in Salonica see Dumont, “The Social Structure,” 44-45; Quataert, “Premieres fumees d’usines,” 168-173; Quataert, “The Workers o f Salonica,” 69-74; Gounaris, Steam Over Macedonia, 135-143.

166 According to Williamson the Ottoman real wage performance lagged considerably behind Europe and many Mediterranean economies. See, J. G. Williamson, “Real Wages and Relative Factor Prices around die Mediterranean, 1500-1940,” in Williamson, J. G. and §. Pamuk (eds.)

increase and were able to negotiate better working conditions.168 According to one
estimate, wages rose by about 60.0% in Salonica between 1905 and 1908.169 For
instance, following a determined and well-organised strike, the workers of the Olympos
brewery managed to increase their wages from an average of Is 4d to 2s Id in 1909. In
the same year, following another determined strike action, workers in the Alatini flour
mills managed to get a substantial wage increase from a previous average of 1j 1Id to
2s 8d. In the Alatini brick factory, average wages of senior workers increased by about
60-70.0%, reaching a high of 2s 10d the same year. Even the young female workers
benefited from such determined strike action and their average earnings more than
doubled to reach Is 3d in 1912.170 This substantial rise in wages curtailed the
comparative cost advantage hitherto enjoyed by the industrialists. In fact, after 1908,
industrial growth slowed down quite notably not only in Salonica, but also in leading
centres o f industrial production in the region. Investment activity came to a halt in many
factories, and the capital stock was left to deteriorate and a number of plant closures
took place during the late 1900s. Apparently, rising labour costs underlay industrial
lethargy and factory closures.171
Another crucial supply side factor that affected the growth of industrial
manufacturing in the region was the availability o f water-power. In specific, the inland
towns o f Vodine, Karaferye, Agustos and Siroz were located ideally along streams and
rivers, which enabled manufacturers direct access to virtually costless water power to
generate energy. Not surprisingly, the machinery installed in all the flourmills and the
cotton spinning factories located in the above mentioned towns were propelled by water
power.172 Surely, this was an important cost cutting advantage. The region had very
limited coal reserves and the bulk o f coal that would be used in steam powered factories
had to be imported from overseas, particularly from Cardiff.173 Imported coal was

172 At the time, there was only one lignite coal mine in Siroz, which produced about 100 tons of coal annually (1307 S.V.S., 1890, 64-65; 1320 S.V.S., 1903,490). This amount was not sufficient to meet the needs o f local railways and factories, and about 15,000 to 40,000 tons had to be imported annually between the late 1880s and the 1910s.
291'


expensive and probably became even more so between the 1880s and the 1910s.174
Besides, coal had to be transported to factories via railway, hence further inflating the
energy costs. Not surprisingly, energy-costs, especially when combined with poor
management or inadequate technical planning, could, and did, cause financial problems
for manufacturers. For example, inflated energy costs were one of the major reasons for
the closure o f the famed Saias spinning mill.175 The closure of the PDA’s Gevgeli silk
filature likewise was related to prohibitive energy costs.176 Thus, it can be argued that
the growth o f industrial production in leading industrial centres of the interior, such as
Vodine, Karaferye and Agustos, would most likely have been limited without the
availability of water power.}77
Local manufacturing industries also enjoyed certain cost advantages that enabled
them to carve out a niche in local markets, despite intense overseas competition. For
example, the cotton spinning industry benefited considerably from the availability of
cheap cotton supplies coming from the Siroz and Zihne districts. As it has been
discussed in Chapter 2, cotton prices declined by about 60.0% from the early 1870s to
the late 1890s. This swift decline was beneficial for local spinning concerns and enabled
them to maintain competitive prices throughout the 1890s. However, this trend was
reversed after the turn o f the century. The rapid growth of tobacco production at the
expense o f cotton production led to a swift rise in cotton prices from c.1900 onwards.
This situation increased the costs incurred by local spinning mills and put them under
considerable financial stress. Some local mills, including the spinning concern owned
by the Sai'as family, could not resist the burden of rising input costs and eventually went
1^4 Comprehensive coal price series are not available for Salonica for this period. The available figures are extremely scattered (thirteen observations for forty years) and do not allow for a robust analysis o f cycles and trends. However, unpublished research data gathered by Pamuk suggest a secular increase in Istanbul coal prices, by as much as 15%, from 1885-1889 to 1905-1910. According to his data, there is also apparent trend acceleration after c.1900. It is very likely that similar trends in imported coal prices prevailed in Salonica. I would like thank Professor Pamuk for allowing me to use his data set.
175 it must be noted that the primary reason behind the closure of the Saias mill in 1901 was the financial difficulties faced by the Saias family. In 1896, the Saias family lost 1,000,000 francs upon the collapse o f the Karamanos Bank in Marseilles, which administered the financial transactions of the family in Europe. Subsequently, the family started extracting capital from the cotton mill to meet its outstanding financial obligations and deliberately forced the management of the company into growing indebtedness. Under the circumstances, the factory management found it difficult to meet current expenses, about all the cost o f the coal and cotton used in the mill. Eventually the firm went bankrupt, and a consortium of Jewish Bankers took the company over and started operations in 1907, under a new joint stock company named Nouvelle Filature (Asir, 2.B.1319 (14.10.1901), N. 625: 2; Asir, 5.B.1319 (17.10.1901), N. 626: 2; Gounaris, Steam Over Macedonia, 142).

bankrupt.178 Nevertheless* -we can suggest that declining cotton prices proved quite
advantageous for the development of the cotton industry in the region in the late
nineteenth century. Similarly, the availability of locally produced animal skins, wool,
barley, grapes and olive oil probably supported the growth of other important industrial
sectors, such as skin processing, woollen textile manufacturing, beer and spirit making
and soap manufacturing.
4.1.3 Entrepreneurship
Dynamic entreprenuership played a determining role in the growth of industrial
production. Two socio-economic groups assumed active entrepreneurial initiative
during the period under consideration. Prominent Jewish families constituted the first
group o f entrepreneurs that pioneered industrial development in the region. These
families owned and managed almost all the leading industrial concerns in Salonica. For
instance, the Alatinis owned the largest flourmill of the town, a large silk filature, a tile
and brick factory, an ice factory and the Olympos brewery.179 The Saias, Modiano,
Torres, Savol and Misrachi families owned all the cotton spinning concerns in Salonica,
either in partnership or independently.180 The Modiano family also owned a large
workshop producing shirts, underwear, veils and umbrellas.181 The Misrachi family had
shares in the distilleries and the breweries o f the town.182 The Torres family owned a
hempseed factory.183 In addition, a number of smaller Jewish entrepreneurs had interests
1'28For instance, rising cotton prices constituted an extra burden for the Saias spinning mill and played a role in its closure (Asir, 2.B.1319 (14.10.1901), N. 625: 2; Asir, 5.B.1319 (17.10.1901), N. 626: 2). 129 The available documents that reveal the details ,of Alatini interests in industrial establishments are as follows: A general account can be found in R.C.L., 1907, N. 238-243: 991-995.

in soap making,184 woollen textiles,185 and iron foundries.186 These Jewish families had
important advantages that enabled them to assume entrepreneurial initiative. First, they
had direct access to and control over regional capital markets. Almost all of these
families acted as bankers and financial brokers and often worked in close contact, and at
times in partnership, with European financial institutions.1.87 As we have seen, especially
the Alatini family had considerable financial interests and, together with Fernandez and
Misrachi families, controlled Banque de Salonique, which was the strongest private
financial institution of the region at the time.188 Financial connections of the said Jewish
families certainly enhanced their capacity to undertake industrial investments.
Secondly, these families had firm commercial contacts, which proved
particularly useful in purchasing raw materials and in the distribution of manufactured
products both within and beyond the region. For instance, the spinning concerns owned
by Jewish families often entered the local cotton markets robustly and made mass
purchases so as to secure low prices. Similarly, the yam produced in their mills could be
mass marketed thanks to the well-established network of agents and intermediary
merchants in which these families played a central role. Their commercial contacts in
other parts of the empire, especially in Izmir and Istanbul, served as another important
marketing convenience, which helped the local industrial concerns stretch their market
reach beyond the region.
Finally, the Jewish industrial concerns benefited from the skills and expertise
accumulating within the broader community. Jewish professionals educated in new
local schools or in Europe worked in these establishments as lawyers, clerks,
accountants and even as engineers.189 They worked actively in the establishment,
operation and management o f the industrial establishments. Besides, these professionals
worked in close contact with European experts and technicians and played an important

role in the importation o f know-how and technology into the industrial
establishments.190
Another social group that assumed active entrepreneurial initiative in the region
was the Greek mercantile community. The Greek mercantile community had long
established commercial interests and controlled a wide network of marketing and credit
connections throughout the region and beyond.191 Similar to Jewish entrepreneurs, the
Greek merchants capitalised on these commercial and financial contacts. They set up
and managed manufacturing concerns in regular partnerships and marketed the produce
through their connections.
These commercial and financial connections largely explain the proliferation of
Greek-owned industrial concerns in the region, especially in inland towns of Vodine,
Karaferye, Agustos and Siroz. All the cotton spinning mills located in these towns were
owned and managed exclusively by Greek entrepreneurs.192 Also, Greek merchants
1^0 Especially the spinning mills owned by Jewish families imported machinery and technical and administrative expertise from England. For instance, the Saias mill imported machinery direct from England and it was managed by two British directors, Mr. J. Ashworth and Mr. Thomas Johnson (P.P.A.P., 1883, V.72: 97; PRO, F.O. 195/1196, 26.10.1878, Barker to Layard). The large mill owned by the Torres and Misrachi families imported all die machinery from England; the spinners were supplied by Howard and Bullough of Accrington, the openers and lap machines by Crighton o f Manchester and the engines and boilers by the Galloways Ltd. o f Manchester (BA, $D-Selanik, 2012/6, 5.R.1302 (22.1.1885); F.O.A.S., 1893, N. 1310: 21-22). Similarly the Alatini flour factory imported its machinery from Europe (BA, $D-Ticaret, 1191/34, 26.B.1308 (7.3.1891); BA, ?D-Ticaret, 1193/13, 24.Ra.1309 (28.10.1891); BA, §D-Ticaret, 1214/4, 7.Ca.l317 (13.9.1899)). Also, the brewery and the ice factory owned by the Alatinis operated on imported machinery (BA, §D-Selanik, 2048/38, 22.C.1322 (3.9.1904)). The machinery installed at the Torres hempseed factory was also imported (BA, §D-Ticaret, 1225/59, 2.Za.l326 (26.11.1908)). Likewise the woollen cloth factory owned by §alom and Benjamen imported the weaving machines from Europe (BA, §D-Ticaret, 1179/10, 10.N.1302 (23.6.1885)).

Harlaftis, A History o f Greek-Owned Shipping, The Making o f and International Tramp Fleet, 1830 to the Present Day, (London and New York: Routledge, 1996).
192 xhe first spinning mill in the region was established in Agustos in 1876 by a group of Greek entrepreneurs led by Dimitri Longo (BA, BEO-Ayniyat, 668/205, 17.S.1392 (25.3.1875); BA, §D-Selanik, 2006/10, 28.S.1292 (5.4.1875)). In 1884 a few Greek merchants established the first spinning mill in Vodine (1307 S.V.S., 1890: 230-231). In 1894 a new water powered spinning mill was founded in Agustos by a group of Greek entrepreneurs, Bili Tsitsi and Co. (R.C.L., 1907, N.238-243: 995). Next year, the owners o f the first Agustos mill, Dimitri Longo and Co., opened another mill in Vodine (BA, §D-Ticaret, 1209/12, 16.B.1315 (10.12.1897); Gounaris, Steam Over Macedonia, 139-140. In 1894, Goutzas and Karatzas established a third mill in Agustos (BA, §D-Ticaret, 1220/2, 3.Ra.l321 (30.5.1903); Gounaris, Steam Over Macedonia, 139). In 1902 a group of Greek and ‘Muslim’ entrepreneurs, Sossidis and Faik Hoca Nota, established the first water powered mill in Karaferye (Veroia) (Gounaris, Steam Over Macedonia, 140; R.C.L., 1907, N.238-243: 995). In the early 1900s two additional mills, one in Karaferye and another in Vodine, were set up by Greek entrepreneurs, Hatzinikolaki and Lappas respectively. Thus, by 1910, Greek entrepreneurs owned seven out of ten spinning m ills in the region. According to Palairet these concerns accounted for 67% of the region’s spinning capacity (Palairet, The Balkan Economies>351).
295


owned numerous factories in these towns. These concerns included woollen textile
mills, tobacco processing workshops, brick and tile factories, distilleries and ice
factories.193 Greek industrial interests did not remain confined to interior towns.
Following the establishment of a number of banks strongly affiliated with Greek
financial interests. Greek capitalists were able to set up a number of factories in
Salonica and interior towns in the late 1900s. These concerns included a few woollen
textile concerns, macaroni factories, an ice factory and a number of tanneries.194 On the
eve of the Balkan Wars, the Greek mercantile community controlled the majority of the
industrial concerns in the region.
Similar to Jewish entrepreneurs, the Greek merchants played a crucial role in the
importation and adaptation of technology, expertise and know-how. The difference
between the two groups appears to be in the degree of the diffusion of their investments
in the region. Whereas Greek interests spread throughout the hinterland, Jewish
concerns remained largely concentrated in Salonica. This situation once again draws our
attention to the importance o f community links in the establishment of industrial and
other major business concerns in the region.
Overall, industrial manufacturing grew steadily and assumed increasing
importance within the regional economy during the late nineteenth century. More
importantly, perhaps, Selanik became one of the leading industrial centres of the Eastern
Mediterranean basin by 1912. With its 148 factories that produced a wide range of
primary consumer goods the industrial base of Selanik compared well with that of
Istanbul and surpassed Western Anatolia.195However, Selanik was not, nor could it be,
a Catalonia, or comparable to the industrial zones emerging in, say, northern Italy. First,
intense overseas competition seriously circumscribed the export potential of the sector.
Local entrepreneurs simply could not compete with their European counterparts who
literally dominated global markets. Under the circumstances, the manufacturers of
Salonica, as well as those in other parts of the empire, found a niche only in local and
proximate intra-regional markets within the Ottoman Empire. As we have seen, they

succeeded in finding that market niche. However, there was tight overseas competition
even in domestic markets. This competition compelled many local manufacturers to
specialise in the production of primary consumer goods that appealed directly to local
tastes and needs. Although initially the lower end of the expanding local and intra
regional markets provided new opportunities for manufacturers, the market eventually
became saturated, leaving little scope for further expansion. Besides, most of these
consumer goods were low value added products that left a relatively small profit margin
for industrialists. As factor costs rose in the manner discussed above, many industrial
establishments naturally faced serious economic problems and the ones that were
mismanaged simply went bankrupt in due course.
At this point, it is important to address the crucial question as to why the
dynamic, experienced and relatively prosperous entrepreneurial class of the Selanik
region did not respond to the overseas challenge by investing in productivity enhancing
technology. It is probable that adverse political circumstances, growing labour
discontent and rising factor costs kept some industrialists from investing in new
technology, especially from the mid-1900s onwards. It is also likely that the
attractiveness o f alternative investment options, such as money lending, financial
arbitrage and real estate development played a role in curtailing investment in
manufacturing industry. As I noted earlier, money lending, tax farming and real estate
speculation yielded much higher returns than any other investment option available to
local entrepreneurs at the time.196 This situation increased the opportunity cost of
productive investments and entrepreneurs felt reluctant to invest in manufacturing,
where market risks were considerable, profit margins were narrow(er), and overseas
competition was tight. When industrial ventures were not, or no longer, profitable,
entrepreneurs opted to invest in these alternative and often lucrative ventures. These
preferences contributed to the technological standstill in manufacturing industries and
the subsequent failure to respond to the challenge of overseas competitors. In other
words, the institutional and economic environment that rendered speculative real estate
transactions, tax farming, financial arbitrage and other usury practices reinforced the
lethargic conditions in the manufacturing sector. The absence o f a strong and financially
sound state apparatus left a regulatory and institutional vacuum that allowed speculative
and usury activities to flourish. This institutional lacuna absorbed much o f the available

capital, leaving little for productive investment elsewhere, thereby working as a major
factor to hold the long-term developmental potential of the regional economy at bay in
this period.
4.2. Artisanal Manufacturing
Probably the most prominent part of the artisanal manufacturing sector in
Salonica was textiles. The region had a long history o f being one o f the most important
centres o f textile manufacturing in the Ottoman Empire. For example, Salonica was a
leading centre o f woollen cloth production. For centuries, the Jewish artisans of
Salonica manufactured fine woollen cloth Qayak) for the Janissary corps.197 They also
produced various kinds of coarse woollen cloth (aba, guha and kepe) that were regularly
sold in Ottoman and European markets as well as in the region. Similarly, the cotton
spinning manufacturers of Salonica and Siroz marketed their quality cotton yam in
Ottoman and European markets throughout the seventeenth and the eighteenth
centuries.198The local cotton weaving manufactures also consumed a substantial amount
of locally produced cotton. The cotton weavers of Salonica and Siroz produced
headgear (turbans), tunics and underwear for the Janissary corps. Artisans in Salonica
Vodine and Karaferye also produced a variety of popular cloth varieties such as alaca,
and bath garments and towels (pe§temals and havlus).199
By the turn o f the nineteenth century, textile manufacturers began to encounter
certain problems. As in other parts of the empire, mounting European competition put
the textile manufacturers under considerable economic distress from the 1820s onwards.
After the 1830s, competition in international and domestic markets hurt the artisanal

cotton spinning industry particularly badly. By the 1850s, the artisanal spinning industry
had almost entirely collapsed in the region, and the sector had retreated to the confines
of rural household economy.200
European competition adversely affected the weaving sector as well. Woollen
textile production was forced to retreat in the overseas markets, as British woollen
goods flooded European markets from the early 1800s onwards. Besides, the raw wool
produced in the region became quite cheap for European merchants, following the
debasement of the Ottoman silver currency during the early decades of the nineteenth
century.201 This situation encouraged European merchants to make heavy purchases in
the Salonica wool market, leaving little produce for local use.202 Local producers thus
faced serious supply bottlenecks, especially in quality wool varieties. Pressed hard
under unfavourable demand conditions and supply side bottlenecks, many Jewish
manufacturers either abandoned weaving and became directly involved in the overseas
wool trade, or specialised in the production of coarse woollen goods. In addition, the
abolition o f the Janissary corps in 1826 entailed a notable contraction in demand for
woollen as well as cotton products, because of the collapse of the military demand for
turban headgear.203 These developments put considerable pressure on local woollen and
cotton textile manufacturers and eventually forced some o f them to abandon the trade.
By the 1870s, the artisanal cotton and woollen textile industries had contracted
notably. However, both cotton and woollen weaving manufacturers managed to survive
the onslaught of overseas competition, the collapse of military demand and the adverse
effects o f currency devaluation. Many artisans responded to these crises by
concentrating on the production of either “authentic” or low-value added, coarse textile
goods that appealed directly to the tastes and the needs of the Ottoman people. For
example, in the early 1880s the woollen cloth manufacturers of Salonica, Karaferye,
Vodine, Siroz, Drama and especially of Nevrekop were still weaving coarse woollen

cloth {aba, kepe), horse cloth (gul), mgs {kilim) and carpets (halt).204 These products
were consumed predominantly within the region, although the famed abas were still
sent regularly to other Macedonian provinces, to Greece and to Istanbul.205 The cotton
cloth weavers o f Salonica, Siroz, Nevrekop and Provide continued to manufacture a
range of popular cotton cloth varieties, such as kirbast and alaca206 The artisans of
Salonica, Karaferye, Yenice and Siroz produced cotton bath garments and fancy silken,
towels {pe§temal, ipekli hamam takimi and ipekli havlu) for local people, who habitually
paid regular visits to the public baths.207 The former turban weavers in Salonica
increasingly specialised in the production of conventional veils {burumcuk and
pegekari) worn commonly- by Muslim women. The cloth weavers in Salonica and
Kavala also manufactured other types of coarse cotton cloth varieties, such as bed sheets
(yataklik bezi), regular white cloths {beyaz bez and pamuk bezi), curtains (perde) and
sofa throws {dd§eme)2m In Yenice, artisans continued to produce linen and silken cloth
varieties {keten and ipekli bez).209
According to official statistics, artisanal textile manufacturing still employed
about 10,900 full-time workers in Selanik during the mid-1880s. Most o f these workers
clustered in the weaving sector (See Table 5.6). At the time, the urban population of the
region probably stood around 150,000. Thus, full-time artisans engaged in textile
production accounted for about 7.3% o f the urban population. If these estimates are
accurate, then we can suggest that the sector still constituted an important component of
urban economic life in the region. Besides, these numbers do not include an
indeterminate number of part-time workers engaged or employed in textile
manufacturing. Therefore, normally we would expect that the sector had a greater
degree of importance than that indicated by the percentage mentioned above.
This brief account should indicate that artisanal manufacturing went through a
period of reorganisation, as well as relative decline, and adopted itself to emergent
economic conditions by focusing on domestic markets. Through a combined strategy of
specialisation in the production of popular goods and of moving towards the lower end

and continued to fulfil important economic functions. The only exception to this, as we
have noted, was cotton spinning, which collapsed almost totally.

Unfortunately, the available quantitative data do not allow a comprehensive
analysis o f the performance of artisanal textile manufacturing industries in the region in
the post-1880 period. However, qualitative sources and the limited quantitative evidence
at hand reveal the dynamism of certain branches of textile manufacturing. In this
respect, we are relatively better informed about woollen textile manufactures and carpet
and rug making. There is also evidence to assess the scope of cotton cloth
manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, of mat and fur production. In what follows, I shall
take stock o f the existing sources to outline the dynamism o f textile manufacturing
industries in the post-1880 period.
As it has already .been noted, the formation o f an autonomous Bulgarian
principality created new opportunities for local woollen textile manufactures, and
injected a new dynamism into the sector. In the late 1880s, there were 2,125 looms
weaving §ayak and aba cloth in Gevgeli, Nevrekop and Tikve§. In the entire province,
woollen cloth manufacturers produced a total of 543,000 square meters of aba and
§ctyak. This output level was considerable and compared reasonably well with the
Bulgarian woollen cloth output at its peak in c.1870, which stood somewhere between
1,400,000-1,650,000 square meters. 210
However, the real growth of woollen cloth production took place later in the
1890s. For instance, in the mid-1890s, artisans were producing an estimated 800,000
square meters of aba cloth in Gevgeli alone.211 The weavers of Karaferye produced
another 15,000 square meters o f §ayak and an additional 67,000 square meters of aba,
§ayak, and other miscellaneous woollen cloth varieties Were produced in the highland
towns of Razlik and Nevrekop.212 These gayaks and abas were sold primarily to the
military units stationed in the area, and the balance was consumed either locally or sent
to Manastir, Kosova, Istanbul and even Bulgaria.213 Besides, an unknown amount of
woollen cloth was produced and consumed locally in a number of locations such as
Avrethisan, Katrin, Kesendire, Demirhisar, Cuma-i Bala, Menlik, Provide and Zihne.214
Taking the above figures into account, it is possible to suggest, somewhat
conservatively, that the production of coarse woollen cloth reached at least 1,000,000

square meters by the late 1890s.215 If so, regional woollen cloth output could well have
grown by more than 80.0% within a decade. When we take into account the carpets,
rugs and woollen stockings manufactured in the province the overall dynamism of the
sector becomes even more apparent.216 This observation is also supported by consul
Blunt’s commercial reports, which regularly point to the growth of local woollen
industries in response to growing military, local civilian and intra-regional demand for
§ayak and aba cloths.217
Assessing the performance o f the other branches of artisanal textile
manufacturing is more difficult, due to a lack o f output statistics. Nevertheless, the
limited evidence at hand indicates that the production of a number of textiles continued
to be important throughout the period. Cotton and cotton silk mix cloth manufacturing
is a case in point. In the early 1890s, cotton cloth manufacturers in Nevrekop, Kdpriilu,
Avrethisar, Zihne, and Yenice operated a total of 1,650 looms, generating an estimated
annual revenue o f O.L. 25,000.218 Nevrekop was the leading centre o f cotton weaving,
and boasted some 500 looms that produced 10,000 rolls o f cotton cloth (bez)
annually.219 In Yenice, there were 52 looms producing bennurk cloth.220 The production
o f bath towels and garments continued in Salonica and Karaferye. In addition, there
were 50 looms producing bath garments (hamam takimi) in Ak?a Mescid.221 The
production of the alaca cloth, shirtings, tunics, sail cloth, towels and bath garments
continued in Avrethisan, where the sector employed about 100 artisans in the mid to
late 1890s.222 Cotton weaving also retained its importance in Siroz and became
prominent in Provide in the late 1890s.223 The 1907 provincial yearbook indicates that
215 This output level compares well with Bulgarian figures. Palairet (1997: 192) maintains that
woollen output of entire eastern Rumelia was, including factory production, 423,000 m2. Unfortunately no output figures are available for northern Bulgaria to make comparisons. Nevertheless the comparisons must be handled carefully due to lack of data pertaining to the weight of the woollen produce as well as the area.
216 For instance in Provi§te there were 141 looms weaving 25,000 pieces o f coarse gul cloth and rugs in c.1890. At the same date, in the entire province about 300,000 pairso f woollen stockings were produced and sold by Vlach tribes (1307 S.V.S., 189Q, 228).

cotton weaving industries were still operating in the above mentioned locations, with no
visible decline or contraction.224
The manufacturing of ready-made clothing constituted another important
component o f the artisanal textile sector. The data presented in Table 5.6 suggest that
there were about 1,900 active tailors operating in the region in the late 1880s. This
should not come as a surprise. Although ready made European outfit varieties had
become very popular among certain sections of the urban populace, many relatively
modest urban residents still regularly asked the local tailors to cut out frocks, suits,
winter coats, shirts and skirtings for occasional use.225 Urban middle classes and
government officers constituted the regular customers of the local tailors.226
It is also important to note that a specialised textile manufacturing industry
developed around the booming tobacco trade from the mid-1890s onwards. The
production o f sacks and mats to be used in the processing and packing of tobacco grew
notably from c.1890 onwards. At the time, 715 mat makers (hasirci), 620 woollen and
goat’s hair sac weavers (muytab) and 45 cotton sac (kirpas penbesi) producers were
operating in the region (See Table 5.6).227 By the late 1890s, the sector had expanded
notably, particularly in the tobacco growing districts.228 For example, more than
100,000 sacs made of goaf's hair were produced annually in Provide in the late 1890s.
In addition, between 50,000 to 100,000 straw mats were manufactured. These mats were
used primarily in the processing o f tobacco, especially in the separation, lining and the
withering o f the produce.229 In Provide alone, the industry employed 250 sac weavers
and 800 mat makers.230 Perhaps more than a thousand workers were employed in sac
224 1324 S.V.S., 1907, 221.
22^ The following example is illustrative o f the growing popularity o f ready made clothing imported from Europe, especially among die more ‘modem’ and prosperous components o f Salonica’s populace. In the early 1900s the Karamursel woollen cloth factory opened a branch in Salonica. One of the journalists working for Asir was apparently ‘struck’ by the quality and attractive prices o f the cloths sold at the Karamursel shop. He bought a couple o f ar§ms of the finest quality §ayak cloth and gave it to a local tailor, Ismail Hakki Efendi, to cut out one coat and a suit for him. The result was outstanding. The reporter then goes on to criticise the ones who chose to buy fancy, yet lower quality and less durable, European dresses just for the ‘fashion’ and ‘trademark’. No doubt the new urban consumer culture was in full swing among the middle income classes o f the town (Asir, 9.Ca.l317 (15.9.1899), N. 414: 1; Asir, 22.Z.1318 (11.4.1901), N. 574: 2).

weaving and mat making in Kavala and Drama.231 Apparently, together with woollen
textiles and possibly cotton cloth making, the manufacturing of sacs and mats for the
tobacco industry was one of the leading textile manufacturing activities in the region. It
is fair to suggest that the sector grew in tune with the booming tobacco trade, especially
after the turn of the century.

The region also possessed a diverse urban manufacturing base that went well
beyond the confines of the textile industry. In all cities throughout the region, there were
artisans working to produce various goods exclusively for the local population. The
production of primary consumer goods and household utensils was of great importance.
For instance, flour milling was possibly the most basic artisanal occupation that was
almost universal throughout the region. In every urban centre, there were a number of
small water powered mills producing flour for the local population.232 As Table 5.6
indicates, flour milling was one of the largest of all artisanal industries. The sector
employed 4,820 full time artisans in the late 1880s. Similarly, thousands of artisans
laboured to produce shoes and footwear, pots, tin cups, copper cutlery, candles, baskets,
quilts, household furniture, guns and clocks along with a number of other essential
consumer goods. Another group of artisans manufactured key iron products, bricks, tiles
and timber, all of which were basic inputs for the booming urban construction industry.
These full-time artisans employed in non-textile manufacturing industries totalled

15,000 souls and constituted another 10.0% of the region’s urban population in the late
1880s.
Lack of conclusive quantitative evidence precludes definitive statements about
the growth performance o f these diverse artisanal manufacturing sectors. However, the
existing secondary literature firmly holds the view that artisanal manufacturing rose in
importance in tune with growing urbanisation in the region. For example, Paul Dumont,
who studied the Jewish artisans of Salonica, suggests that artisanal production grew
rapidly, mainly in response to growing urbanisation and the rapid ‘modernisation’ of
lifestyles in the town.233 Recently, Meropi Anastassiadou has confirmed Dumont’s
findings and pointed to the rapid proliferation of artisanal manufacturing in response to
growing tide o f urbanisation and modernisation in Salonica.234
This view is confirmed by Table 5.7, which indicates the growth of the number
o f artisans registered in the town of Salonica between 1883 and 1898. The increase in
the number o f full-time artisans employed in the making of household goods, cutlery,
furniture and footwear is particularly striking. Among other reasons, the development of
the sector can be attributed to the growth in urban demand for the goods that it
produced. Comparable data were not available for other artisanal sectors.235
Nevertheless, considering the relatively limited nature of European competition in such
consumer goods as pots, tin cups, copper cutlery, candles, baskets, quilts and household
furniture, we would expect a similar expansion in other artisanal occupations. By the
same token, we could somewhat speculatively expect a similar expansion in artisanal
sectors in other, interior, towns o f the region, especially in rail-connected centres of
commercial agriculture where urban growth was more prominent.
Overall, a number of demand side factors seem to have created certain
opportunities that enabled local artisanal manufacturers to survive, and even to expand
233 Dumont “The Social Structure,” 38-44. 234 Anastassiadou, Salonique, 337.
235 The data presented in Table 5.7 reveals only a partial picture o f the growth process. For 1883 I used the relatively comprehensive 1886 provincial yearbook. For 1898 I mainly extracted the data for 1898 mainly from Dumont and Anastassiadou. I could only incorporate the coinciding artisanal sectors included in both data set to maintain consistency between two observations. Nevertheless, it might be also illustrative to note that the 1886 yearbook reports 1,856 full time artisans working in both manufacturing and service sectors. Dumont/Anastassiadou estimate a total o f 2,272 artisans in 1898. However, it must be noted that many crafts cited in the 1886 yearbook are not included in the Dumont/Anastassiadou series. See Dumont, “The Social Structure,” 42; Anastassiadou, Salonique, 337.

their activities during the period. The growth of local urban, military and intra-regional
demand for textiles, processed foodstuffs and other primary consumer goods was
particularly important in this respect. Also the rapid growth of cash crop production,
especially of tobacco production, had a propulsive impact on certain branches of
artisanal manufacturing. It is important to note that these were exactly the same demand
side factors that underlay the growth o f mechanised manufacturing sectors in the region.
However, the advantage of,small scale artisans was that they produced a wide range of
high and low value added manufactured goods and thus catered to the needs of the local
(urban) population from the richest to the poorest segments. It is precisely this wide, yet
specialised, market spread that enabled artisanal manufacturing to resist the tide of
overseas competition and flourish during the period under consideration.
Conclusion
The arrival o f the railways in the region and the growing tide of
commercialisation were the primary factors that underlay urbanisation in the Selanik
region. The development of the service sector and a frenzy of construction activity
accompanied urban growth. Commercial, transportation and catering services grew
rapidly in accord with the proliferation of urban areas, especially of port cities and
railway towns, which served as the nexus of marketing and distribution in the region. In
addition, new urban professions emerged and expanded in response to the growth of the
commercial economy and the ongoing process of modernisation. New commercial and
residential buildings, as well as extensive infrastructures, were built to physically
accommodate the urban masses and the growing commercial economy. Local
mercantile classes, notables and European capitalists played an important role in the
growth o f this leading urban sector and invested considerable sums into commerce,
catering, transportation, and urban real estate development.
The proliferation of the urban economies and the emergence of new urban
lifestyles also created fresh demand for consumer goods and construction materials. The
bulk o f new urban demand, appears to have been, was absorbed by imports from
overseas. However, these developments, also created new opportunities for the
manufacturing sector. In addition, the rapid growth of cash crop production created
fresh demand for new processing and manufacturing products in the region. The
308


dynamic entrepreneurial classes that had direct access to financial sources and assumed
a strong presence in local and intra-regional marketing networks soon responded to
emerging opportunities and established new factories in leading urban centres of the
region. In due course, they benefited considerably from the availability of cheap labour
power, raw material inputs and abundant water power and found a stable, if narrow,
market niche in the region, despite intense foreign competition. However, local markets
soon saturated and many industrial concerns encountered demand side problems. Also,
the notable rise in factor costs, especially in wages, put considerable pressure on local
capitalists and brought industrial expansion to a halt in most parts of the region. Many
industrialists failed to respond to the challenge by upgrading their technology and
adopting more aggressive marketing strategies that would expand their business
horizons beyond the immediate markets. In this process, a complex set of political and
economic factors helps explain the reluctance of the local capitalists. For one,
worsening political conditions and growing uncertainties in the region probably
withheld them from investing into industrial projects. More importantly, the attraction
o f usury practices, real estate speculation, tax-farming, and financial arbitrage increased
the opportunity cost of productive investments, making manufacturers reluctant to
invest in risky industrial projects.
The artisanal manufacturing sector, on the other hand, benefited from the
expansion o f urban demand. Self-employed artisans who relied on simple technology
and low capital outlays and specialised in the production of goods that appealed directly
to local tastes or on high value added products, were able to respond well to emerging
opportunities in urban areas. Also, the textile sector benefited considerably from robust
government demand for woollen textiles and from the proliferation of the tobacco
processing industry. Thus, small-sized artisanal establishments survived and even grew
in importance despite an initial period of adaptation and re-organisation during the
earlier decades of the nineteenth century.
The richness and diversity of the urban experience marks the complexity and
contradictions of the modernisation process in the Selanik region. First, the apparent
growth and proliferation o f urban economies stand in contrast with the processes of
retardation and backwardness that affected agriculture. The different impact of the
world economic forces on agriculture and modem sectors appears to have undergirded
the apparent contrast. While capitalist integration brought riches to mercantile classes,
309


notables, moneylenders, and other agents of capitalist integration, the excluded
segments and compartments of the agrarian economy paid a heavy price and fell into
severe crisis and retardation, Also, the political and institutional environment seems to
have fed into the widening contrast by allowing the persistence of speculative and rent
seeking motives. Surplus capital simply did not find its way into disadvantaged
agricultural sectors. Instead, it went into urban areas and projects, which yielded higher
returns and provided a more amenable lifestyle for men of prominence and power.
Second, the contrasts and tensions that gradually emerged within the urban
process itself underlines the complexity of the modernisation pattern that we encounter
in the Selanik region. The coexistence o f modem factories, sweatshops and dynamic
small-scale artisanal manufactures, which utilised different levels o f technology,
adopted different forms of labor procurement, and specialised in the production of
different types of goods underlined not only the richness of the urban experience but
also its transitional nature. In this transition, facets of “modernity” mesh with those of
“tradition”. Likewise, mounting political tensions and emergence of urban forms of
resistance and discontent underline the explosive nature of this transitionary process. It
can not be a coincidence that the 1908 Young Turk revolution empted in Salonica. I
interpret this movement as the historical outcome o f the political and economic tensions
that had been building up in the region along with its gradual transformation and
urbanisation. Intensifying economic inequalities, political tensions, and shifts in cultural
and ethnic identities accompanied these developments ultimately metamorphosing into
irreconcilable revolutionary movements and wars that concluded the Ottoman period of
the region’s history.

AFTERWORD
Selanik became one of most modernised and dynamic regions of the Ottoman
Empire during the late nineteenth and the early twentieth centuries. With its tightly knit
marketing networks and extensive railway systems, relatively well-developed financial
markets, fluid land market, modem factories, burgeoning urban areas and port-cities,
Selanik had clearly become one o f the leading commercial regions of the entire eastern
Mediterranean basin by the turn o f the twentieth century.
Two primary forces underlay the process of economic modernisation in the
region, namely the capitalist world economy and the reform efforts of the Ottoman
government. Enhanced integration with the world economy brought new opportunities
and helped bolster economic modernisation in the region. For instance, certain sub
sectors o f the agrarian economy, namely tobacco, opium and to a lesser extent silk
cocoon production benefited from robust overseas demand, and the institutional and
financial support provided by the Ottoman Public Debt Administration (PDA) and the
European and American trading houses operating in the region. Likewise, European
capitalists played an important role in the development of marketing and financial
networks, economic infrastructure (railways, harbours and urban utilities), urban real
estate development, and the emergence of modem manufacturing concerns in the
region. In this regard, the capitalist world economy appears to have been the prime
driver of economic modernisation and growth in the region.
The Ottoman state also contributed to the moment of commercialisation and
overall economic development. Legal reforms that largely liberalised the land-regime of
the empire and the consolidation o f property rights over land, the establishment of the
Agricultural Bank, the foundation of agricultural schools, model farms and agricultural
machinery depots were all important steps that helped enhance commercialisation and
economic modernisation in the region. Likewise, the infrastructure investments carried
out by the Ottoman government contributed significantly to the commercialisation and
urbanisation o f the regional economy during the period. In addition, timely and well
executed crisis management schemes undertaken by the government enhanced the
311


stability of the agrarian economy at large and increased its capacity to resist crop
failures and other dislocating factors.
However, processes of economic growth and modernisation proceeded hand in
hand with those o f serious economic retardation and dislocation in the region.
Ironically, the very same forces that fostered processes o f economic growth and
modernisation also undermined its long-term potential for economic development.
Enhanced integration with the world economy retarded certain key
compartments o f the regional economy. Intense European competition in overseas
markets and, more importantly, in the under-protected domestic market posed serious
demand-side problems for manufacturers and agriculturalists alike.
Foreign competition in domestic markets, for instance, circumscribed the growth
potential o f manufacturing industry and forced it to specialise in the production of low
value-added goods that appealed directly to the tastes and needs of the local population.
This situation left the manufacturing industry, especially modem manufacturing
concerns, extremely vulnerable to changes in factor prices. Rising labour costs, raw
material and energy prices quickly ate into the already narrow profit margins and put
local manufacturing concerns, especially textile producers, under acute economic
distress, forcing some into bankruptcy towards the end of the period.
Likewise, the radical reduction in global freight rates and transportation costs,
combined with the ensuing price depression in global markets left local cereal and
cotton producers exposed to intense foreign competition in both overseas and domestic
markets. Subsequently, the sub-sectors went into a period of serious and long-lasting
recession and within a matter of two decades agricultural production declined by about
30%. More importantly, the ensuing recession created serious socio-economic
dislocations in the sector. Pressed hard under distressing mortgages and debt incurred at
usury interest rates during the crisis, many farmers ultimately lost their lands and
became tenants over the property they once owned. Subsequently, dispossessed farmers
were forced to accept the exacting terms of unfavourable tenancy agreements. Others
increasingly turned to non-agricultural pursuits, especially to seasonal migration and to
by-employment, whenever these options were available. Many more chose to migrate to
cities, and still others emigrated overseas in quest o f new opportunities and remittances.
312


Clearly, such dislocations constitute the destructive creativity of modernisation
and mark the beginnings of what we can call a “Great Transformation” (after Polanyi)
in Ottoman lands. However, these socio-economic dislocations prepared the structural
background to the political and ethnic tensions that seriously disrupted economic
development in the Selanik region later from mid-1900s onwards.
The fiscal, political and diplomatic weakness of the Ottoman government gave
way to economic retardation and arrested the ongoing process o f economic development
in the region. In this context, three processes/linkages appear particularly important to
note.
First, the diplomatic weakness of the Ottoman government was a serious
problem. Bound by the trade treaties signed with European powers, the Ottoman
government could do little to shelter domestic markets from overseas competition. This
circumscribed the growth potential o f the manufacturing sector at large and gave way to
serious retardation in agriculture. Likewise, the government could not effectively
control or mediate the tariff policies o f the railway companies who charged exorbitant
fares. Inflated transaction costs, in turn, undermined the development o f the agricultural
sector, especially of cereal production, which had for centuries been the primary axis of
agricultural production in the region.
Secondly, the fiscal feebleness o f the government had a retarding effect on the
agricultural sector at large. The mammoth fiscal needs of the government put a heavy,
burden on the rural economy and put farmers under acute economic distress. Under
adverse price and/or harvest conditions, many farmers failed to meet their fiscal and or
financial obligations and eventually lost their property. Their distress accelerated the
processes of agrarian retardation and socio-economic dislocation.
Third, the fiscal weakness o f the government also circumscribed its capacity to
institute far-reaching economic reforms. Pressed hard under serious political and
financial problems, the government was compelled to concentrate its reform efforts in
such crucial areas as provincial administration, justice, and security. Under the
circumstances, financial resources available for economic reform remained limited. The
313


government failed to provide sufficient and/or regular logistic and technical support to
the farmers in the region. Thus, agriculture remained at a technological standstill, which
circumscribed the competitiveness of the sector, especially in overseas markets. When
combined with inflated transaction costs, unfavourable price conditions and rural
depopulation, technological stagnation circumscribed the growth potential of the
agrarian economy.
Finally, the fiscal feebleness and the organisational inadequacies o f the Ottoman
government left a massive regulatory vacuum within which speculative and rent-seeking
motives could be liberally manifested. The fiscal weakness of the central government
undermined its organisational capacity and prevented it from consolidating its power
over the provinces. Notwithstanding the relative centralisation drive of the Hamidian
era, the lack o f direct government control in the provinces allowed for, and indeed
necessitated, the maintenance of alternative, more indirect forms o f governance in the
provinces, whereby local agents held key positions of power and controlled processes of
economic redistribution. Under the circumstances, such rent-seeking practices as tax
farming, usury, concession hunting, and real estate speculation emerged as lucrative
means o f income generation and power consolidation. Thus, considerable capital was
tied to speculative ends. Although such practices contributed to capital accumulation,
they ultimately undermined the valorisation of capital in its broad sense. To put it
briefly, the weakness of the state left ample space for speculation and rent seeking,
which effectively hindered productive investments and thus arrested economic
development, especially in agriculture.
Thus, a dual economic structure emerged in the region towards the end of the
nineteenth century, whereby facets of “modernity” meshed with those of economic
retardation. Clearly, this duality reflects the transitionary nature of the regional
economy at large and points to the dynamic interaction of local structures with the
encompassing moment o f incorporation into the capitalist world economy. The tensions
and contractions of this transformation process ultimately fed into the ethic and political
tensions and pulled and pushed the region towards mass uprisings, revolution and
ultimately to war. The catastrophes of the two Balkan Wars and the Great War marked
the end o f a unique era o f striking contrasts; contrasts that were manifest in the
coexistence o f processes of growth and retardation, of modernisation and tradition, and
of transformation and standstill. Ironically, these contrasts did not evolve in
314


contradiction, but metamorphosed in a process of dialectic interaction and unity. It
appears that the mould, or the driver, o f this evolution process was the sweeping power
o f European capitalism.
The case of Selanik also reveals important clues about the problematic nature of
economic growth and modernisation in the late nineteenth century Ottoman Empire at
large. Enhanced integration with European capitalism certainly brought new
opportunities for economic growth in other parts o f the empire. Western Anatolia, Trace
and Istanbul, Adana and certain parts o f central Anatolia benefited considerably from
enhanced integration with the world economy and became leading centres of
commercial agriculture and economic growth, especially after the arrival o f the railways
from the 1870s onwards. In this process, rail served towns and port cities emerged as
centres o f commerce, finance and manufacturing.
However, processes of economic growth remained circumscribed and came in
sporadic fits when conditions were most appropriate. First, growth surfaced in sectors
that meshed well with the moment o f capitalist incorporation; ‘excluded’ sectors
remained largely retarded, due mainly to serious demand side constraints and
prohibitive transaction costs. Besides, growth processes could not be sustained
indefinitely, for the feebleness o f the technological base, particularly in agriculture, left
the production process highly exposed to the unexpected shifts in demand side
conditions (typically manifest in prolonged price depressions) and or supply side
shocks. Under the circumstances, it proved extremely difficult to sustain enclaved
growth processes.
The fiscal, organisational and diplomatic feebleness of the Ottoman state
apparatus also exacerbated the problems o f the Ottoman economy and circumscribed its
developmental potential at large. An excessively liberal trade regime, a heavy and rising
fiscal burden, insufficient market regulation, inadequate promotion and diffusion of new
technology, and the resilience of endemic rent-seeking motives were the manifestations
of a weak(ening) state apparatus that could do little to counterbalance the dislocating
and retarding effects o f enhanced integration with European capitalism.
Thus, the Ottoman economy emerged as a troubled, yet dynamic, one, which
was overburdened with serious institutional inadequacies, prohibitive transaction costs,
315


erratic demand conditions, and dislocating political, economic and financial effects of
enhanced integration with capitalist world economy. Under the circumstances, the
response to the challenge, of ever aggressive expansion of capitalism could not
materialise in Ottoman lands, not at least until the later years of the Unionist, or perhaps
more appropriately later in the Republican, era. Seen from a comparative perspective,
the late nineteenth century was a period of falling behind, of widening divergence, and
of deepening relative backwardness for the Ottoman economy.

APPENDIX 1
Tax Revenues and the Estimation of the Real Tax Base
1. Tithe Revenues:
For the compilation of tithe revenues I used two sprimary sources. First, I used
the regular fiscal data published by the Ottoman government. This data was available on
a provincial basis only for the period 1888-1895. Secondly, I used the fiscal data
published in provincial yearbooks to complete the series until 1905. Thus, it was
possible to compile a comprehensive tithe data series for the entire period, 1888-1905.
The data is presented in Table-1 below.

2. Compilation of the Tax Deflator:
I gathered the price data necessary to deflate tax revenues from two sources. I
mainly used Gounaris’s data on cereal prices in Selanik. However, Gounaris’s serious
had gaps for certain years, namely 1887, 1901, 1902 and 1904. To overcome this
deficiency, I used the price data regularly published in the local daily Asir. I mainly
took the first observation pertaining to the first week of each month of the lunar
calendar and then averaged the monthly estimates to reach annual figures. This effort
enabled me to compile a comprehensive price series for 1883-1909. The data is
presented in Table-2 below.

Based on the 1907 statistics, I then determined the weight of each crop in the
commodity basket (see Table-3) and then compiled a standard Laspeyres price index for
the period 1883-1909, taking 1907 as the base year. Then I compiled a 3-year moving
average, which served as proxy for a tax-deflator due to reasons discussed in Chapter-1.
By deflating the indexed nominal tithe revenues I could reach a ‘real’ tithe index, which
I used as proxy to determine production trends in cereal production.
