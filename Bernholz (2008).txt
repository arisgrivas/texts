Editorial
The South-Eastern European Monetary History Network (SEEMHN) is a
community of financial historians, economists and statisticians, established in April
2006 at the initiation of the Bulgarian National Bank and the Bank of Greece. Its
objective is to spread knowledge on the economic history of the region in the context
of European experience with a specific focus on financial, monetary and banking
history. The First and the Second Annual Conferences were held in Sofia (BNB) in
2006 and in Vienna (OeNB) in 2007. Additionally, the SEEMHN Data Collection
Task Force aims at establishing a historical data base with 19th and 20th century
financial and monetary data for countries in the region. A set of data has already been
published as an annex to the 2007 conference proceedings, released by the OeNB
(2008, Workshops, no 13).
On 13-14 March 2008, the Third Annual Conference was held in Athens,
hosted by the Bank of Greece. The conference was dedicated to Banking and Finance
in South-Eastern Europe: Lessons of Historical Experience. It was attended by
representatives of the Albanian, Austrian, Belgian, Bulgarian, German, Greek,
Romanian, Russian, Serbian and Turkish central banks, as well as participants from a
number of universities and research institutions. Professor Michael Bordo delivered
the key note speech on Growing up to Financial Stability. The participants presented,
reviewed and assessed the experience of SE Europe with financial development,
banking and central banking from a comparative and historical perspective.
The 4th Annual SEEMHN Conference will be hosted by the National Serbian
Bank on 27th March 2009 in Belgrade. The topic of the Conference will be Economic
and Financial Stability in SE Europe in a Historical and Comparative Perspective.
The papers presented at the 2008 SEEMHN Conference are being made
available to a wider audience in the Working Paper Series of the Bank of Greece.
Here we present the first of these papers, by Peter Bernholz.

GOVERNMENT BANKRUPTCY OF BALKAN NATIONS AND THEIR CONSEQUENCES FOR MONEY AND INFLATION BEFORE 1914: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
Peter Bernholz Univeristy of Basel
ABSTRACT
A difference is made between open and hidden or veiled government bankruptcies. The latter are happening if budget deficits are covered by substantial money creation leading to inflation. In this case non-indexed government debt loses its value and is inflated away. This path is not open, if the debt is not denominated in the national but in a stable foreign currency or in units of gold or silver. This is usually the case for debt owed to foreigners. But sometimes both kinds of government bankruptcies are occurring together. In the present paper several general qualitative hypotheses are tested for the Balkan countries and the Ottoman Empire

1. Introduction
Where the payment of interest and the repayment of debts in self-inflicted devalued or ruined currency brings about an improvement of the fiscal situation, not an open but a veiled government bankruptcy takes place. Veiled government bankruptcy is the modern method of national bankruptcy.
(Terhalle 1931, my translation)
If a government becomes unable to meet its obligations, there exist several
methods how to escape them. Either the debt or the interest on it is reduced more or
less openly by government decree, or by raising the taxes on interest payments.
Another method is to lower its real value by inflation. This is all related by a
tautological unpleasant financial and monetary relationship (Sargent and Wallace
1981). Historically, whereas a ruler like Philip II. of Spain declared three open
bankruptcies during the second half of the sixteenth century, the method of veiled
bankruptcy has become more and more widespread during the last century. Philip did
not touch the value of the Spanish currency, the piece of eight (peso de ocho) which
had established itself as a leading international currency and became the precursor of
the dollar.
Still, veiled government bankruptcies reducing the nominal value of debts by
inflation were certainly not unknown even before the last century of inflation
following the demise of the gold standard. Thus a well-known German encyclopaedia
explained already before 1914 (Meyers Konversationslexikon 1907) that government
bankruptcies may occur as follows:
1) Repudiation of government debts that is an announcement that the state would not pay back the total or parts of its debt or pay interest on them. Such a refusal happened in earlier times often when the government changed. The new government declared the debts incurred earlier to be illegal (some US states 1841, Denmark 1850, ... France during the revolution); 2) Discontinuation of payments for an indefinite period; 3) A unilateral reduction of interest ... that is without the creditors agreeing; 4) A unilaterally introduced higher taxation of interest amounting to a hidden reduction of the interest rate, which can also occur by interest payments in debased coins or paper money; 5) Issue of an excessive amount of paper money turned into compulsory legal tender.
(Vol 18, p. 807 f., my translation)

Point 5 obviously refers to veiled bankruptcy. The article goes on to mention as
recent examples of government bankruptcies that of Turkey 1875, of several countries
in Central and South America (here Argentina 1890 should be mentioned), Portugal
1892 and Greece 1893. But other Balkan states faced the same problem in the decades
before 1914: Serbia went bankrupt, too, and Bulgaria came near to bankruptcy. Only
the situation of Romania proved to be more stable.
In the following we will undertake a comparative study of “open” and “veiled”
government bankruptcies of Balkan countries before 1914, and of the relationship
between national bankruptcy, inflation and devaluation. In doing so we have to
differentiate between government debt expressed in national currencies and that
denominated in foreign currencies, where the latter is mostly held by foreign
creditors. For whereas the former debt can be reduced in real terms by inflation as
long as the respective state has control of its currency, this is not true for the debt
denominated in foreign money. Before 1914 most of this debt was expressed in terms
of stable gold and silver currencies, like the French franc, the British pound and the
German mark, which also scarcely fluctuated because of the gold standard among
each other. This was different for Russia and Austria Hungary until the 1890s, which
were for long periods on paper money standards during the 19th century.
2. Developments in the Ottoman Empire until 1914
We begin our comparative analysis by looking at the developments in the
Ottoman Empire until 1844 that is before most Balkan states reached their full
independence. As already shown by Pamuk (2004), the empire suffered from a
substantial budget deficit during the first half of the 19th century, which was mainly
covered by incurring domestic debt and money creation. The latter led to substantial
inflation and thus to a fall of the exchange rate (Figure 3.1). According to our
definition the period is thus characterized by veiled bankruptcy.
Unfortunately, no figures for government budget and the money supply are
available. But we know that a substantial debasement of the Kurush took place. A
look at our figure also reveals that one of the hypotheses we want to test is clearly
supported by the empirical evidence. With the flexible exchange rate to the pound as a

result of the debasement, a substantial undervaluation of the Ottoman currency
develops: The exchange rate moves up more quickly and more strongly than the price
level.

Stuttgart: Franz Steiner.
In 1843-44 the situation changed dramatically. The government took reforms
to stop the debasement of the currency and to balance the budget. Its efforts to stop
the decline of the exchange rate proved to be successful, for the new parity with the
pound could be maintained until the First World War (Figure 2.3). However, after two
years the budget again turned into deficit (Figure 2.2). This meant, of course, that the
deficit had now to be covered by rising credit, mainly by borrowing abroad, since the
inflation tax was no longer available. But foreign loans were necessarily denominated
in stable foreign money, given the British gold standard. This meant that with ever
increasing government debt open bankruptcy of the Ottoman state could not be
avoided in the long run. We will return to this event later, when we analyze the open
bankruptcies threatening all Balkan governments except Romania in the decades
preceding the First World War.

We now turn to the development of prices and exchange rate as a consequence of
these fiscal and monetary policies. According to our hypotheses we would now expect
at least a removal of the undervaluation of the kurush compared to the British pound,
and perhaps even an overvaluation since the Ottoman Empire suffered from a stronger
increase of prices than the United Kingdom. And indeed, the price level is strongly
moving ahead of the stabilized exchange rate in the years soon after the reforms. This
is quite in tune with other historical experiences. Subsequently we see a tendency of
the price level to move towards the exchange rate which seems to suggest a return to

purchasing power parity. With the beginning of the new century, however, another
rise of the price level can be observed. Does this mean that an overvaluation of the
kurush was still present in 1913?
To answer this question we have to take up two points. First, the developments
sketched in Figure 2.3 do not take into account that a substantial undervaluation was
present in 1843, so that the stronger rise of the price level might just have removed
this. Looking at the data we find that until 1913 the price level rose to 1291.89 and the
exchange rate to 1376.63, with the base set equal to 100 for 1799. Given the empirical
problems with the cost of living index and the selected base year, the small remaining
„undervaluation“of about 6% may be just an artifact.
The second point refers to the development of price levels in the stable countries of
the center. For they have to be taken into account for problems of purchasing power
parities. I have looked up the figures for the cost of living index for Switzerland. And
indeed, the above picture does not change. For the Swiss index remained stable for all
practical purposes in the long run. If we set the earliest figure for 1811 equal to 100,
the index reached 100.58 in 1913.
So, we can draw the cautious conclusion that either purchasing power parity
was restored for the kurush before the First World War, or a slight undervaluation
remained.
3. Fiscal and Monetary Developments in Four Balkan Countries
We turn now to developments in Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia and Greece and have
first a look at the development of government budgets. We learn several facts from
Figure 3.1. First, Greece and Serbia showed the most critical budgetary situations.
Second, times of severe financial distress seem to occur for Greece around the 1880s
and the late 1890s and for Serbia around the early 1880s and around 1900. Third,
Greece was experiencing the strongest budget fluctuations among the four countries.
Fourth, the Bulgarian financial situation looks precarious around the late 1890s and
the first years of the new century, but seems to be better than that of Greece and
Serbia. Finally, Romanian government finances became never dangerous, since
budget deficits were soon compensated by surpluses. Neither an open nor a veiled
government bankruptcy ever threatened.

3.1 Romanian Developments
As a consequence of its sound government finances Romania was never
motivated to manipulate its currency by debasement; its exchange rate could always
maintain its parity (Fig. 3.2). At first look it seems also that an undervaluation of the
leu occurred, which should only happen according to our hypothesis if the Swiss rate
of inflation were higher than the Romanian.1
1 To take the Swiss cost of living index for the comparison seemed to be adequate, since both currencies were fixed one to one to the French franc (Latin Monetary Union).

This seems, however, not to have been the case (Figure 3.3). Now it may
probably have been wrong to take 1887 as the base year. But we did so since no data
were available for the exchange rates of the years before. With an assumed earlier
stability of the rate2 and taking 1877 as a base year, the red line would shift up
strongly, suggesting an overvaluation of the leu, which diminished in time.
This would be in tune with our hypothesis, since the average annual rate of
inflation in Romania was 1.4% compared to -0.54% for Switzerland. So we might
again, like in the case of the Ottoman Empire, either have in the end some remaining
overvaluation or an approach towards purchasing power parity, which would
correspond to our hypothesis. We cannot be too certain about the result, since some
deviations have to be expected, given the fact that for Romania we have only an
unweighed arithmetic average of fourteen goods, mostly victuals. We see also greater
fluctuations of the Romanian price index than of the Swiss CPI, which are probably
caused by the higher volatility of food prices because of bad harvests altering with
good ones.
3.2 Greek Developments
Greek developments have been well described by Lazaretou (1995). She
describes several switches of exchange rate regimes as a consequence of budgetary
problems leading on the one hand to veiled government bankruptcy and on the other
to stabilization policies moving the exchange rate back to the old fixed parity. The
periods of financial distress can be clearly seen by looking at the figures for the
accumulated deficits in terms of annual revenues (figure 3.1). These are the years after
1833, the 1880s and early 1890s and the late 1890s. Later financial stress is again
developing with the two Balkan wars and the First World War.
Given the work of Sophia Lazaretou (1995) our paper can limit its analysis to the
validity of the hypotheses for under- and overvaluation. As she reports, Greece
suspended the convertibility of its currency four times from 1833 to 1914, but
returned always to convertibility with an exchange exchange rate fixed to the French
2 14.4 guilders of Austrian currency were paid for 100 Lei (equal to Walachian piasters) in Vienna in 1842 and 15 in 1863 (Schneider et al. 1991, p. 412). This suggests a long-term stability of the Lei.

15
franc at a parity of one to one before the First World War (Table 1, p. 30). All
suspensions of convertibility were caused by the financing of excessive government
deficits by money creation. The government reverted several times to open
bankruptcy but also used extensively money creation to finance its deficits and thus
presumably also to reduce its domestic debt by inflation. The tendency of politicians
and governments to incur deficits and to finance parts of them by money creation or
debasement is a well known historical fact explained by public choice theory
(Bernholz 2003, Chapter 2). Inflation and the abolishment of fixed exchange rates can
thus only be prevented, if the hands of governments are bound by strong institutional
safeguards. But given the international gold standard, it can be observed that weaker
peripheral countries, not only the Balkan countries, but for instance also Argentina
and Brazil always strove to return to a fixed parity. This has been explained as caused
by the aim of politicians either to follow the example of the more developed countries
of the centre (Bernholz 1987) or (and) to be able to restore their creditworthiness to
foreign creditors (Lazaretou 1995, p.48).

In testing the hypotheses for under- and overvaluation of the Greek currency we
have unfortunately to limit ourselves to the period after 1877. For data concerning the
development of food prices and of the exchange rate are only available from 1877, so
that the earlier periods of distress, namely in the years after 1833 cannot be examined.
But the remaining period from 1877 to 1914 casts at least some light on the validity of
our hypotheses.
Source: Lazaretou (1995), Table 3.4. Note: Unweighed arithmetic average of food prices.
We have seen (Figures 3.4) that fiscal distress developed in the 1880s, stayed
until the early 1890s and returned in the late 1890s. This corresponds with the
development of the exchange rate (Figure 3.5). Until the mid-eighties it remained
relatively stable near its parity. But afterwards the parity could not be maintained and
the exchange rate became flexible and moved up strongly by about seventy percent.
The price level followed more slowly, so that a substantial undervaluation developed.
With stabilization policies setting in around 1900 the exchange rate fell more
drastically than the price level and purchasing power parity was restored when the old
fixed parity was reached. This corresponds to the hypotheses to be tested.
By contrast, the development from 1877 to 1887 seems to contradict the
hypothesis that with a higher domestic than foreign rate of inflation an overvaluation

of the drachma should have developed. For since the price level fell, whereas the
exchange rate remained relatively stable, this looks like an undervaluation. But this
impression may be deceptive, since this development could be the removal of an
earlier overvaluation. We cannot know as long we do not have figures for prices and
exchange rates for the years since 1833.

3.3 Bulgarian Developments
The Bulgarian fiscal developments were less favourable than those of
Romania but better than those in Greece and Serbia (Figures 3.1 and 3.4). Periods of
financial distress were limited to the late 1890s and the beginning of the first decade
of the 20th century and again to the times of the Balkan wars. They were also by far
less severe than those of Greece (compare Figures 3.4 and 3.6). This is reflected in the
development of the exchange rate since 1879 (Figure 3.7). In fact, the parity could be
maintained until 1914. With the price level falling in the early 1880s an
undervaluation developed. When it began to rise since 1902, the undervaluation was
first reduced and then turned into an overvaluation. Both events are quite in tune with
our hypotheses. We will discuss later (Section 4) whether the financial distress

3.4 Developments in Serbia
As can be seen from Figure 3.8 there occurred three periods of fiscal stress in
Serbia since 1881. Worst in the 1880s, then around the turn of the century and finally
from 1909. Beginning in about 1901 we have a rigorous consolidation which even led
to an accumulated surplus in the following years.
Unfortunately, exchange rates were only available to me since 1886. If we
look at food prices, we cannot find evidence of an inflationary development in the
1880s (Figure 3.9), a fact which may be, however, a consequence of the earlier rise by
about 40 to 50 % in 1869 and the 1870s, which was maintained later. Around 1889 a
reduction of the price level can be observed which may be a consequence of the
strong reduction of the accumulated deficit during that time. After that period, but at
least since the late 1890s an inflationary trend can be observed again.

Note: Unweighed arithmetic average.
For the years from 1886 and 1896, respectively, exchange rates for French franc
and the Austrian guilder are available (Figure 3.10). They show that the exchange rate
for the franc and the guilder, presumably expressed in paper dinars, since the agio or
premium on the twenty dinar gold coin diminished even more, fell from 1894 until

1908. This probably reflects a move towards the parity for the gold dinar, which is
towards full convertibility. In this sense a stabilization effort for the Serbian currency
was undertaken. Together with the rising level of food prices this led probably to an
overvaluation of the dinar, quite in line with the hypothesis to be tested. But at least
part of the divergence may be just a correction of an earlier undervaluation, though I
believe that only a part of the divergence can be explained by such a correction, since
in 1908 a premium of 20.26 % on the twenty dinar gold coin remained. It had fallen to
this value from 23.1% in 1894. This is a reduction by 12.3%. By contrast the
divergence of the development of food prices and exchange rate from 1896 to 1908
amounted to more that 50% in 1908. But still, these are just speculative judgments as
long as we have no figures for earlier exchange rates.

For prices: see Figure 3.9. Notes: The exchange rates for the French franc have been calculated by using the agio on metallic dinar. The exchange rate of dinars per Austrian guilder was set equal for 1896 to that of the French franc.

4. Open Bankruptcies of Balkan Countries
With a stable monetary policy and fixed exchange rates veiled government
bankruptcy becomes impossible. The same is true if the debt or great parts of it are
denominated not in the national but in stable foreign currencies. But foreign
currencies were stable under the then prevailing gold standard. Given these
conditions, an accumulation of debt at a rate higher than that of GDP must necessarily
lead in time to open government bankruptcy. We have, therefore, to look into the
respective experiences of the Ottoman Empire, Greece, Serbia and Bulgaria which all
showed fiscal distress during periods in which they were striving for stable monetary
policies and had reached or were attempting to move towards fixed exchange rates.
As shown above the Ottoman Empire introduced stable monetary policies and
a fixed exchange rate already beginning in 1844 (Figure 2.2). But at the same time
government deficits remained sizable, so that the international indebtedness rose. As
had to be expected, open government bankruptcy followed on April 13, 1876. After
several years of negotiations the international debt was reduced from 250 to 106
million British pounds, and the interest rate to at least 1%, but with an annual
amortization of 1/3 % of this remaining debt (Meyers Konversationslexikon, vol.
19,1908, p.829). An international commission, the Conseil d'Administration de la
Dette Publique Ottoman was created. It consisted of one private member from each of
the following countries: Britain, Italy, France, Austria-Hungary and Germany. Several
public revenues were pledged to serve the remaining debt and were administered and
controlled by this commission (Meyers Konversationslexikon, vol. 6, 1904, p. 570).
But in spite of these developments public finances did not improve much and, as we
have seen, new fiscal distress arose in1888, 1896 and from 1908 to 1912. In 1906 the
international debt amounted to 129.1 million British pounds (Meyers
Konversationslexikon, vol. 19,1908, p.822). These developments pointed to a
renewed government bankruptcy, even if the First World War had not occurred.

Bulgaria Near bankruptcy New loan saved around 1900 situation
We have already seen that Greece suffered from similar problems from the
beginning of its new existence in 1832, as well described by Lazaretou (1995).
Convertibility at par was already abolished in 1848 because of an overissue of
banknotes. From 1895 a stabilization of monetary policies began which ended with a
return to the old one to one parity with the French franc. Before this time Greece had
not only reduced its real debt denominated in the national currency and increased its
revenues by an inflation tax, but also accumulated increasing debts denominated in
foreign currencies. This led to open government bankruptcy in 1893. At this time the
government debt had risen to 598 million French franc and to 152 million devalued
paper drachmas. The government reduced the interest rate on the foreign debt one
sidedly to one third during the next years . But when the fiscal situation worsened
even farther because of the defeat by the Turks in 1897, the Greek government agreed
to a European Financial Commission similar to that instituted for the Ottoman Empire
(Meyers Konversationslexikon, vol. 8, 1904, p. 310). Its members were mandated by
the governments of Germany, France, Britain, Italy, Russia and Austria-Hungary.
This commission had the right to control and to administer certain government
revenues pledged for serving and amortizing the international debt (Meyers
Konversationslexikon, vol. 6, 1904, p. 571). It also imposed a moratorium on the
issue of new banknotes and mandated the withdrawal of two million drachmas a year
from dirculation until the exchange rate reached par. These and other reforms led to

24
more healthy monetary policies and to an increase of the exchange rate of the
drachma until it had reached its original parity with the French franc in 1909. And
during this process the National Bank of Greece, led by the able Stephen Streit, was
able to establish its independence from the government, whereas the government had
still forced the Bank in 1891 to lend it most of her gold reserves (Lampe and Jackson
1982, pp. 214 and 218 f.).
If we turn to Serbian developments a similar pattern emerges. We observe
periods of financial distress in the 1880s, around 1900 and around 1910 (Figure 3.8).
The situation became so difficult in 1893 that neither public officials nor the interest
on government debt could be paid (Meyers Konversationslexikon, vol. 18, 1907, p.
362).. As a consequence the debts were consolidated into a new loan with an interest
of 4 % and a Serbian Autonomous Monopoly Administration created in 1895. It
controlled and administered several government revenues including those of the state
monopolies with the purpose to serve the interest and amortization payments on the
international debt (Meyers Konversationslexikon, vol. 6, 1904, p. 570 f.). The Serbian
National Bank was able to reassert herself against the government, and in this process
the money supply was reduced by three million dinars and further note issues frozen
until 1900 (Lampe and Jackson 1982, pp. 213 f. ) . As a consequence the exchange
rate of the dinar rose substantially during the following years (Figure 3.10).
Let us finally consider the Bulgarian financial situation. It has already been
shown that the exchange rate could be kept at par from 1890 to the outbreak of the
First World War (Figure 3.7). Financial distress developed before 1914 only around
the turn of the century. A new loan agreed on by parliament and prince in 1899 could
first not be obtained in Vienna and then in France. Thus the salaries of the officers of
the army and of the bureaucrats were cut by 7% in 1899, and 20-30% of them paid for
two years in treasury bonds. The prince agreed to forego 50% of the payments he
received by the state, and the government was entitled to issue an amount of 40
million lev in treasury bonds. But the budgetary situation remained precarious, and
led to additional insufficient savings by reducing the number of districts in 1901 and
of the number of recruits in 1902. Thus it became necessary to convert government
debts with the help of a new loan in the amount of 260 million lev in 1902. Only this
new loan could help to bridge the remaining deficit (Meyers Konversationslexikon,
Electronic copy available at: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4165367


25
vol. 3, 1903, p. 588 f.). But the budgetary situation improved afterwards and no open
government bankruptcy occurred.
5. Conclusions
Simple arithmetic relationships exist between government deficits, their financing
in capital markets and through central banks and the money supply. High inflations
have usually been caused by financing excessive government deficits which were
financed by creating money. All inflations in Balkan countries before 1914 and that of
the Ottoman Empire as well as the abolishment of their fixed exchange rates
corresponding to monetary regimes based on gold or silver standards were caused by
veiled government bankruptcies. They usually led to an undervaluation of the
respective currencies. If, however, fixed exchange rates were maintained or restored, a
tendency towards overvaluation of the currency or a removal of the earlier
undervaluation took place.
Open bankruptcies also occurred several times because of excessive deficits
financed by incurring foreign debt denominated in stable currencies. In several cases
they were combined with fixed exchange rates or motivated their restoration.
Unfortunately a lack of data prevented in a couple of cases to come to a
definite conclusion concerning the hypotheses tested.
