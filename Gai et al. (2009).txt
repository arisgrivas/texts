Abstract
This paper explores the determinants of sovereign bond yields during the classical
gold standard period (1872-1913). Using the Pooled Mean Group methodology, we Önd
that the main beneÖt of the gold standard was as a short-hand device that enhanced
a countryís reputation in international capital markets. By conveying important infor
mation to investors and enhancing the speed of adjustment of sovereign bond spreads
to long-run equilibrium levels, the gold standard allowed country risk to be priced more
e§ectively. In contrast to other studies, our results suggest that fundamental factors
were more important in determining a countryís creditworthiness in the long-run than
the exchange rate regime per se.

1 Introduction
Membership of the gold standard is often regarded as a signiÖcant factor driving yield spreads
on sovereign bonds issued during the period leading up to World War One. A seminal study
by Bordo and Rocko§ (1996) argues that adherence to the gold standard served as a ëgood
housekeeping seal of approvalí, shaving as much as 40 basis points o§ sovereign bond spreads.1
An important recent contribution, using a much larger country sample and a wider range
of macroeconomic variables, by Obstfeld and Taylor (2003) also conÖrms the role played by
the gold standard in enhancing sovereign credibility before 1914. Their Öndings also indicate
that, to a large extent, country risk was priced without much reference to fundamental
macroeconomic variables such as the level of public debt and the terms of trade.
While such results suggest that the exchange rate regime plays an important role in the
long-run determination of spreads, they shed little light on how it helps a country acquire
a reputation for Önancial probity. A countryís reputation for creditworthiness in previous
periods is likely to have a substantial bearing on its current reputation. This may be because
the ëtypeí of policymaker running the country could change over time in ways not readily
transparent to foreign lenders.2 Creditors, therefore, are required to constantly update their
beliefs about the type of policymakers that they face. With Bayesian updating of country
risk, bond spreads are likely to exhibit a high degree of persistence and deviate from steady
state levels for a long time. These deviations are likely to vary from country to country,
particularly if investors are wary of ëemergingícountries at the periphery of the international
Önancial system.
Obstfeld and Taylor (2003) tackle the dynamics of country risk using a lagged dependent
variable model with the Arellano-Bond (1991) one-step dynamic panel estimation technique
1A number of country-speciÖc studies Önd similar results. See, for example, Sussman and Yafeh (2000) and Lazaretou (2005) for the cases of Japan and Greece. 2For example, policymaker types could change unobservably over time and a reputation is gradually built as a ëdisciplinedítype separates himself from other types (Mailath and Samuelson, 2001). Alternatively, leadership changes may have a causative e§ect on economic growth and change perceptions of creditworthiness (see Jones and Olken, 2005).

estimated by the generalised method of moments (GMM). But, as Pesaran et al. (1999)
observe, the Arellano-Bond technique can lead to inconsistent estimates in heterogeneous
dynamic panels when the time dimension, T; is large. There is a risk, therefore, of misleading
inferences about the true determinants of spreads and the long-run e§ect of the gold standard
on country risk. Moreover, the Arellano-Bond approach does not permit heterogeneity in
the short-run adjustment process for yield spreads. So, little can be said about how the
gold standard contributed to reputation building by di§erent countries at the ëcoreí and
ëperipheryíof the international Önancial system.
In this paper, we examine the evolution of sovereign spreads in the pre-World War One
era using a similar (though not identical) dataset to Obstfeld and Taylor (2003). We use
the Pooled Mean Group (PMG) technique of Pesaran et al. (1999) to derive consistent esti
mates for the determinants of country risk and examine the (di§ering) speeds of adjustment
towards long-run equilibrium. Our Öndings are as follows. First, the prime beneÖt of gold
standard membership appears to arise through a more rapid convergence of spreads towards
their long-run equilibrium, suggesting that membership conveyed important information to
investors that enabled them to price risk more e§ectively. Second, and in contrast to Obstfeld
and Taylor, gold standard adherence was not, by itself, su¢ cient to drive borrowing terms.
Rather, investors appear to have attached signiÖcance to fundamental variables such as low
ináation, Öscal balances, and levels of economic development when pricing sovereign risk in
equilibrium.
Our paper is related to several recent cross-country studies of the gold standard era.
Meissner (2005) examines the timing of adoption of the gold standard and shows that coun
tries with large borrowing costs and signiÖcant trading relationships with other gold standard
members were more likely to Öx their exchange rates earlier. Mauro et al. (2002) provide
evidence suggesting that investors in the pre-World War One era paid particular attention
to country-speciÖc fundamentals when pricing risk. Flandreau and Zumer (2004) argue that
the gold standard may have played a much more modest role in the evolution of the global
3


Önancial system than hitherto assumed. But their use of feasible generalised least squares
(FGLS) with large panel data dimensions also raises the spectre of inconsistent estimates
stressed by Pesaran et al. (1999) and Pesaran and Smith (1995).
Ferrucci (2003) also uses the PMG approach to study the determinants of sovereign bond
spreads. His focus, however, is on a panel of countries covering the recent period 1992 - 2002.
He Önds that while bond spreads reáect fundamentals, non-fundamental factors also play a
signiÖcant role. Unlike the present paper, his analysis of short-run dynamics focuses on the
gap between the equilibrium and observed level of spreads and does not consider the role
played by the exchange rate regime in ináuencing the adjustment to equilibrium.
Obstfeld et al. (2005) study the extent to which the gold standard ináuenced the degree
to which countries in the international monetary system followed the world (i.e. the UK)
interest rate. Using a similar dynamic equilibrium correction technique to ours (Pesaran et
al., 2001), they suggest that the classical gold standard era was a period of limited monetary
independence, consistent with the capital market openness of the time. By comparing the
adjustment periods of country interest rates to long-run equilibrium periods, they contrast the
rapid transmission of interest rate shocks with the greater monetary autonomy of the post
World War Two Bretton Woods era. But their analysis does not consider the fundamental
determinants of country risk or how it may have evolved di§erently in ëcoreíand ëperipheryí
countries.
The structure of the paper is as follows. Section 2 describes the econometric framework
and motivates the PMG methodology. Section 3 presents the main results and discusses the
preferred parsimonious speciÖcation. Section 4 considers the robustness and sensitivity of
our results. Section 5 concludes. Details of data sources and diagnostic tests are contained
in the Appendix A and B respectively.

2 Econometric Framework
2.1 Data
Our data is annual and covers twenty-two countries between 1872 - 1913. The sample begins
in 1872 since many countries join the gold standard from the mid-1870s onwards giving a more
balanced panel dataset. We follow Obstfeld and Taylor (2003) and separate countries into
ëcoreíand ëperipheryí. The ëcoreícountries are predominantly Anglo-Saxon and European,
namely Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway,
Russia, Sweden, the United States and the United Kingdom. The ëperipheralíor ëemerging
marketícountries in the sample are: Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Chile, Greece, India, Italy,
Japan, Portugal and Spain. Our sample di§ers from Obstfeld and Taylor (2003) in that it
excludes South Africa, New Zealand, Turkey, Finland, Hungary, and Mexico, but includes
Russia and the Netherlands. The Global Financial Database (GFD) and Mitchell (1992,
1993, 2000) are our primary sources. These data were corroborated against the datasets used
by Obstfeld and Taylor (2003) and Flandreau and Zumer (2004). Some missing gaps were
Ölled by consulting other recent studies of the gold standard era, for example, the nominal
GDP. We take our measure of country risk to be the bond spread over UK consol yields.
The bond yields used are from gold or sterling bonds traded in the London capital market,
and their attributes are described in Appendix A along with details of the selected control
variables.
Figure (1) illustrates the average cost of external borrowing facing these countries in
the pre-World War One period. It is clear that countries belonging to the ëcoreí of the
international monetary system experienced much lower yield spreads than their counterparts
on the ëperipheryí. The di§erence in the average spread between the two groups is 261 basis
points and there is considerable diversity amongst countries. The ëcoreícountries typically
faced borrowing costs that were 74 basis points above the UK rate, while the ëperipheryí
countries faced interest rates around 335 basis points above the UK rate. Figure (2) plots

CORE PERIPHERY
sovereign bond spreads for selected ëcoreíand ëperipheryícountries. They conÖrm the picture
of gradual convergence in bond spreads reported by Obstfeld and Taylor (2003) for the period
leading up to 1914. This may be attributable to the rising popularity of the gold standard as
a stable and credible regime underpinning the international monetary system and integrating
global capital markets (see Figure (3)). From a statistical perspective, it suggests that certain
long-run parameters might be identical across groups.
2.2 Model
Following Edwards (1986), Bordo and Rocko§ (1996) and Obstfeld and Taylor (2003), sup
pose that yield spreads are determined by the relationship:
SP READit = i + iW SP READt + Xit + uit; (1)
where Xit captures lagged control variables commonly used in country risk analysis such
as the ináation rate, the level of real GDP per capita, the M2 to GDP ratio, as well as

W SP READt captures the e§ects of global interest rate shocks in international capital mar

is the GDP-weighted return on the global bond market portfolio.
The PMG approach to estimating (1) is appropriate for several reasons.3 First, as ex
plained in Pesaran and Smith (1995) and Pesaran et al. (1999), the procedure yields con
sistent estimates given the dimension (N = 22 and T = 42) of the panel data. Although
Arellano and Bond (1991) suggest that the full range of IVs in a GMM procedure helps ad

dress inconsistency, Pesaran et al. (1999) argue forcefully that the Arellano-Bond technique
nonetheless delivers inconsistent long-run coe¢ cient estimates in heterogeneous dynamic pan
els when T is large. This is readily illustrated by the fact that di§erent authors derive quite
di§erent conclusions on the determinants of yield spreads when using di§erent sub-country
and sub-period samples. Second, as a dynamic panel estimation procedure, it explicitly al
lows for di§ering speeds of adjustment of the convergence of spreads towards the long-run
equilibrium. The di§erent dynamics of convergence of ëcoreíand ëperipheryícountries sug
gested by Figure (2) points to the importance of taking this into account. Third, PMG allows
estimation of heterogeneous short-run responses of countries to policy changes which could
capture the nature of the data.
Our PMG model of sovereign risk is essentially a dynamic equilibrium correction equation
of the form:
SP READit = i + iSP READit 1 + 0
1Zit 1 + 2W SP READt 1 + (3)
3GSit 1 + i SP READit 1 + W SP READt 1 + 0 Zit 1 + uit;
where Zit 1 is the set of explanatory variables, i are individual Öxed e§ects, and i the
speeds of adjustment to the long-run equilibrium. For lagged dependent variables, we choose
a maximum lag of one to preserve su¢ cient degrees of freedom. The short-run dynamics of
the model are governed by the coe¢ cients of i, and 0. As with Pesaran et al. (1999), uit
is assumed to be independently distributed across i and across t.4
The long-run equilibrium of yield spread for each country is:
SP READit = 1
i
[ i+ 0
1Zit + 2W SP READt + it] ; (4)
4Although independence across t could be violated due to possible serial correlation for long time series, this problem can be addressed by increasing the lagged order on both the dependent and independent variables ñwe do not follow this approach because of the limited degrees of freedom available to us.
9


where the it are stationary processes. For a long-run equilibrium to exist, i 6= 0, and for
convergence i < 0. To obtain the coe¢ cients of the long-run relationships, we follow the
assumption of long-run homogeneity discussed in Pesaran et al. (1999). This is done by
taking the simple average of iís across countries ( ), and multiplying it by i, 0
1 and 2 to
obtain:
SP READit = 0i + 0
1Zit + 2W SP READt; (5)
where 0i = i ; 0
1 = 01 ; 2 = 2 . In the estimated models of (3) and (4), the vector of
explanatory variable enters with a lag order of one. Deviations from equilibrium are possible
in the short-run.
In Section 3, we discuss the choice of variables in Zit 1. Since the choice of suitable
explanatory variables in the sovereign debt literature is typically ad hoc, we adopt the general
to speciÖc approach (Hendry and Richard, 1983) to test the model down to its parsimonious
speciÖcation. Unless stated otherwise, these variables enter equations (3) and (4) with a
timing convention of t 1. To address potential endogeneity, we use a lag order of two for
the ináation rate and the variables that are expressed as a ratio of nominal GDP. The coding
of the gold standard adherence dummy, GSit, is subjective. To make matters simple, the
dummy is assigned the value 1 when countries formally announced their legal commitment
to gold (de jure status).
3 Results
3.1 Feasible GLS and PMG Estimation
We begin by initially estimating equation (1) with the feasible generalised least squares
method used by Obstfeld and Taylor (2003). We then compare the results against the esti
mated PMG models of equations (3) and (4). The beneÖts are two-fold. First, it checks the
10


quality of our data. Second, it acts as a robustness check of the ëgood housekeeping seal of
approvalíhypothesis on a somewhat di§erent set of countries to that used by Obstfeld and
Taylor (2003). This may be relevant since some authors (e.g. Flandreau and Zumer, 2004)
question the impact of gold standard adherence on yield spreads.
Table (1) presents results for two speciÖcations used by Obstfeld and Taylor (2003).
Regressions 1.1 to 1.4 employ variants of the gold standard as the sole explanatory variable.
In the Örst two estimations, we follow Obstfeld and Taylor (2003) and allow for the fact that
some countries in the sample may have been in full or partial default. We, therefore, interact
the gold standard dummy with a dummy registering defaults to gauge the extent to which
investors were able to di§erentiate between gold standard adherence and debt compliance.
The variable GS no def ault is deÖned as an interaction of the gold standard dummy with a
dummy for no default on sovereign bonds, while the variable GS def ault is the interaction
of the gold standard dummy with a dummy for episodes of default. Regressions 1.3 and 1.4
then consider the e§ects of the gold standard in isolation. By contrast, regressions 1.5 to 1.8
include a range of control variables, such as debt to GDP ratio, ináation, and open economy
indicators. Note that the regression results reported in 1.1 and 1.5 are directly reproduced
from Obstfeld and Taylor (2003) to facilitate comparison.5

Regression 1.2 suggests that the coe¢ cient of GS no def ault (-0.18) is comparable to
that obtained by Obstfeld and Taylor (2003). Clearly, however, this variable could proxy
for other omitted country characteristics. Regression 1.6 shows that, upon adding other
variables, the coe¢ cient remains broadly unchanged and is signiÖcant at the 5% level.6 The
key determinants of yield spreads for our sample are episodes of debt default, the level of
economic development (measured by the log of real GDP per capita), and ability to pay (the
log of exports/GDP).
This preliminary experiment is supportive of the Öndings of Obstfeld and Taylor (2003).
As a further check, we consider the de jure deÖnitions of the gold standard in isolation
instead of jointly accounting for e§ects of default episodes. In regression 1.3, gold standard
adherence lowers yield spreads by 29 basis points. The addition of further control variables
in regression 1.7 conÖrms the robustness of this Önding ñthe level of economic development
and ability to pay remain key. Mere changes in the deÖnition of the gold standard do not
appear to a§ect the estimates.
Regressions 1.4 and 1.8 in Table (1) present the results obtained with the PMG estima
tion method. The coe¢ cients reported are the long-run equilibrium relation between yield
spreads and various explanatory variables. As with regression 1.3 based on FGLS, the coef
Öcient capturing the beneÖts of adopting the gold standard in regression 1.4 is appropriately
signed and signiÖcant as a stand-alone variable. But the impact on yield spreads (around
70 basis points) is much more marked, however. Upon adding further control variables, the
gold standard dummy remains signiÖcant (at the 5% level) as does the level of economic
development at the 1% level. The good housekeeping e§ect of the gold standard, therefore,
appears to be robust across econometric procedures.
A major shortcoming of the regressions reported in Table (1) is the somewhat ad hoc
choice of explanatory variables. We therefore use the general to speciÖc approach (Hendry
and Richard, 1983) was used to test the model (see equation (3)) down to its parsimonious

speciÖcation (see Table (2)) using the PMG procedure. These regressions do not include
country speciÖc GS terms.7 Since the analysis could be sensitive to the deÖnition of the gold
standard in a dynamic setting, we consider three variants. Regression 2.1 uses the simple gold
standard dummy. The e§ect of the gold standard is interpreted as a long-run phenomenon.
In regression 2.2, the gold standard variable is interacted with yield spreads, GSSP READ.
A large and negative coe¢ cient for GSSP READ would imply that the adoption of the gold
standard shortens the time required for a country to converge to the steady state and reap
the beneÖts of reduced yield spreads. This coe¢ cient could be interpreted as reáecting the
learning behaviour of investors as they update their assessments of country risk. Regression
2.3 allows for both the long-run and adjustment e§ects of GS.
Several conclusions can be drawn from Table (2). First, there is a signiÖcant equilibrium
correction term ranging between 0.39 to 0.47. It suggests that yield spreads adjust fairly
quickly to their equilibrium levels with an average half life of some 1.5 to 1.8 years following
a shock or policy change.
Second, fundamental variables play an important role in spread determination. The level
of economic development, as measured by log real GDP per capita, is signiÖcant across all
speciÖcations. This variable is deÖned in terms of natural logarithms, so the coe¢ cient
associated with it implies that a 1 unit increase in the log of real GDP per capita reduces
spreads by 26 basis points (based on regression 2.2).8 Besides economic development, the
ratio of Öscal balances (revenue minus expenditure) to nominal GDP, F ISCGDP , and the
ináation rate, IN F L are also signiÖcant determinants of yield spreads. A large Öscal surplus
will lower a countryís cost of borrowing as revenues improve ability to pay as well as serve as
collateral. For every 1 percentage point increase in F ISCGDP , yield spreads are lowered by
around 7 basis points in the long-run. Countries with a track record of high ináation also face
higher borrowing costs ñ a one percentage point rise in ináation raises spreads by 5 basis
7This is so because most of the countries have adopted the gold standard by the 1900s (see Figure (3)). These coe¢ cients could not be estimated as they have mainly entries of zeros. 8Obtained by dividing the coe¢ cient of LRGDP P C, -2.015, by the mean of the log real GDP per capita of entire panel data, 7.64.

points as shown in regression 2.2. Perhaps surprisingly, our results suggest that common
shocks to interest rates, W SP READ, do not have a signiÖcant impact on spread levels,
though the positive coe¢ cient indicates that a 100 basis point increase in the global yield
di§erential with the UK rates raises spreads by around 50 basis points. The lack of perfect
correlation with the base rate could reáect a degree of capital immobility or the presence of
narrow bands permitting some exchange rate movement between gold points.9
Third, short-run dynamic terms are signiÖcant determinants of yield spreads.10 A coef
Öcient of approximately 0.4 on DSP READL points to a fairly high degree of persistence
in bond spreads. The size of the coe¢ cient suggests that reputations of creditworthiness in
previous periods plays a part on the formation of current reputations and the cost of bor
rowing. Deviations of a countryís yield from world interest rate could also reáect a change
in investorís risk assessment about systematic risk. The estimate (of 0.5) for DW SP READ
suggests that the transmission of common interest rate shocks to yield spreads is also not
instantaneous.
Across the three speciÖcations in Table (2), regression 2.2 is the preferred model. In re
gression 2.1, the long-run impact of the gold standard on borrowing terms is clear to see. But
without an interactive term between GS and yield spreads, it is hard to comment on the evo
lution of country risk. In regression 2.3, which models both long-run and adjustment e§ects,
we would not expect long-run e§ects to show up strongly if the gold standard was purely
a reputational device for investors to learn about a country. As regression 2.3 shows, the
long-run coe¢ cient is insigniÖcant (and incorrectly signed), while the adjustment coe¢ cient
is signiÖcant and of similar magnitude to the one in regression 2.2.
Returning to regression 2.2, the coe¢ cient of the gold standard interacted with the lagged
9See Obstfeld et al. (2005) for a discussion of this issue. In a related study on the determinants of emerging market bond spread in the 1990s, Min (1998) found that external common shock, measured by the three-month US Treasury bill, is not signiÖcant. This is also consistent with Antzoulatos (1996) who shows that the US interest rates matter little in the determination of bond áows to the Latin economies in the 1990s. 10We constrain the estimates of short run dynamic terms to be identical across countries to preserve su¢ cient degree of freedom.

yield spreads GSSP READ is estimated to be -0.16. On average, a country adopting the gold
standard found its borrowing costs converging more quickly to long-run equilibrium levels.
In general, ëperipheralícountries joining the gold standard experience a more rapid spread
convergence than the ëcoreí countries. For the sample as a whole, the imputed half life to
achieve lower yield spreads upon adoption of gold standard alone (using regression 2.2)) is
4.4 years.11 By contrast, with the interaction variable GSSP READ of regression 2.2 the
half life is 1.8 years.12 In other words, gold standard adherence may have allowed investors
to price country risk much more e§ectively.
The diagnostic tests for the three models (bottom rows of Table (2)) suggest that the
parsimonious speciÖcations may su§er from mild heteroskedasticity problems. As highlighted
earlier, the assumption of homoskedastic disturbances gives rise to consistent, but ine¢ cient,
estimates. So the presence of potential heteroskedasticity may not be severe enough to
invalidate our Öndings. Furthermore, the p-values for these tests are much too close to
us to exercise judgement on the choice of preferred model based on this criterion, especially
between regressions 2.2 and 2.3. The LM bar test on the residual shows that there is no serial
correlation. As such, a long-run cointegrating relation among the explanatory variables does
exist for all three speciÖcations. Regression 2.2 is our preferred speciÖcation on grounds
of economic intuition and for satisfying the panel cointegration test (which is more crucial
amongst the diagnostic tests).
3.1.1 Half-lives
Recall that, for the existence of long-run equilibrium, it is necessary to have i 6= 0. When
i < 0, there is convergence to the long-run steady state equilibrium for each country. Table
(3) presents the speeds of adjustment i and half-life of countries for speciÖcations reported
in Table (2). These speeds of adjustment are well behaved in 17 out of 22 countries in
11The value of half-life was imputed from the coe¢ cient of GSSP READ in regression 2.2. 12 This is obtained by 1
0:405 0:156.
17


which i 0.13 There is an anomaly for two countries, India and Sweden, where speeds of
adjustment are estimated at essentially zero. This could be because the steady state for these
two countries is not being well captured by the model, and therefore the speed of adjustment
is ill-deÖned. The overall results are not, in any case, sensitive to the inclusion of India and
Sweden.
13Countries with i = 0 are not reported in Table (3), and these are Canada, Chile and Greece.

Overall, the results from Table (3) support the hypothesis that there exists a homogeneous
long-run relationship across the countries. A small absolute value of the adjustment speed
translates to a higher half-life where a country takes longer to converge to the steady state.
A common-sense check should indicate that ëperipheralí countries take longer to converge
compared with ëcoreícountries. Across speciÖcations, the results show that borrowing costs
in Argentina took 1.4 years on average to converge; Brazil took around 1.7 years and Italy took
approximately 4 years. Meanwhile, yields in ëcoreí countries such as France and Germany
took around 0.7 and 1 year on average to converge. Based on regression 2.2, the ëcoreí
countries on average have a speed of adjustment of -0.50 which translates to a half-life of
1.8 years, whereas a ëperipheralícountry has a speed of adjustment of -0.36 which yields a
half-life of 2.5 years.
Another noteworthy feature is that Austria and Spain are estimated to have a relatively
low half-life even though they did not adopt the gold standard regime at all during the period.
This reinforces the Öndings from Table (2) which show that the gold standard serves as a
signaling device in the short-run and that fundamentals matter more in the long run.
3.2 Parsimonious SpeciÖcation
We now document the steps involved in obtaining the parsimonious speciÖcation of regression
2.2 in Table (2).14 For short-run dynamic terms, second di§erences were considered.15 These
measure the acceleration of the chosen macroeconomic variables, and so attempt to reáect
any surprises in trends. Since some of these variables could be I(2), taking second order
di§erences is a conservative practice that creates stationary variables and ensures consistent
estimates.
Regression 3.1 in Tables (4) and (5) considers all plausible explanatory variables in the
dataset. In addition to those considered in Table (2), we also included: a measure of political
14Regressions 2.1 and 2.3 were tested down in similar manner. 15These are debt to GDP ratio, ináation, Öscal balance to GDP ratio, log of export to GDP, custom revenue to GDP, M2 to GDP and log of terms of trade. We also experimented with Örst di§erences and obtained quantitatively similar results.
20


conditions P OLIT Y 2, the level of Önancial development M 2GDP , and customs revenue as
ratio of GDP, CU SREV GDP . The coe¢ cient of GSSP READ is estimated to be -0.08
which seems plausible (see regression 3.1). In regression 3.2, DDF ISCGDP , DDIN F L,
DDLT OT and DDM 2GDP were Örst dropped as they were highly insigniÖcant. P OLIT Y 2,
an index measuring the degree of democracy, was estimated to have a positive, but insigniÖ
cant coe¢ cient - so we remove the variable. DDCU SREV GDP appears to have the wrong
sign. The accumulation of custom revenues should typically reduce the cost of a countryís
borrowing rates in the gold standard era. DDLT OT , an open economy indicator for export
competitiveness, was also dropped as it was insigniÖcant.
In regression 3.3, we continue to remove wrongly signed and insigniÖcant variables from
regression 3.2. We now focus on the long-run equilibrium coe¢ cients. The measure of
Önancial development reáected by M 2GDP is negative but not signiÖcant. A high level of
indebtedness of a country, DEBT GDP , might be expected to lead to higher borrowing costs.
Again, the coe¢ cient is not signiÖcant. Finally, open economy indicators like LEXP GDP
and LT OT were also generally insigniÖcant.16 In regression 3.4, we remove CU SREV GDP
which correlates positively but not signiÖcantly with yield spreads. Since higher custom
revenues should enhance ability to repay, a positive e§ect on yield spread seems counter
intuitive.
High ináation might indicate poor economic performance and signal prospective pay
ments di¢ culties. In general, one would expect a positive relation between lagged ináation
(measured by annual change in CPI levels) and changes in yield spreads. Using the PMG
estimator, the coe¢ cient of ináation rate is unstable in regressions 3.1 to 3.4. In regression
3.5, we drop the ináation rate to examine the implications. Since the magnitude and signif
icant of the GSSP READ variable increases, it suggests potential signs of omitted variable
bias. So, in regression 3.6, we restore the ináation rate in the regression. A percentage point
increase in ináation adds 5 basis points to yield spreads.
16These variables are also not signiÖcant in Obstfeld and Taylor.

4 Robustness
To further substantiate our results in regression 2.2 from Table 2, we consider additional
robustness and sensitivity checks. SpeciÖcally, we vary the degrees of long- and short-run
heterogeneity.
In the general PMG setup, the basic speciÖcation (3) matches a short-run dynamic term
to every long-run coe¢ cient. By adopting the general to speciÖc approach, we restrict the
coe¢ cients of some of these short-run dynamic terms to be zero. We also restrict some of
the short-run dynamics to be identical across countries. We Örst add DF ISCGDP into the
regression since the long-run level e§ect of Öscal balance to GDP ratio is signiÖcant. But this
does not change the result quantitatively. Since F ISCGDP could be a fairly non-stationary
process that is often related to business cycle properties, we consider DDF ISCGDP: But
this does not change the outcome signiÖcantly. As such, Öscal balance is only important in
the long-run.
The coe¢ cient of average W SP READ is not close to one in regression 2.2 of Table 2. In
using the variable, we have assumed that the relation between W SP READ and yield spreads
remains homogeneous across countries. This may not be realistic given that di§erent countries
could have di§erent long-run beta terms. So we relax the assumption on homogeneity in the
long-run e§ects of W SP READ. In doing so, we obtain point estimates of betas for each
country. Ideally, one would expect these beta terms to be high for risky countries and low for
the more developed countries. We do obtain beta terms greater than one for risky countries
like Argentina (338 basis points) and Portugal (400 basis points). Whereas, the beta terms
are less than one for the less risky countries like Belgium (41 basis points) and USA (24 basis
points). We also obtain negative beta terms for some countries, notably Brazil and Denmark.
While it is conceivable that investments in these countries might pay o§ when the world
portfolio does not, it should be noted that these coe¢ cients may be imprecisely estimated
ñ particularly since the introduction of additional variables lowers the e§ective degrees of
24


freedom.17
As a next step, we add, in turn, DSP READi, DW SP READi, DIN F Li and DERV ARi
to evaluate the e§ects of heterogenous short-run dynamic terms. This again attempts to
identify these e§ects separately compared to Table 2 where they are restricted to be the
homogenous e§ects. In these separate experiments, the coe¢ cient of core economic vari
ables (i.e. the level of economic development, Öscal balance to GDP ratio and exchange rate
variability) remains stable and robust across speciÖcations.
We then add W SP READi and estimate with the sequential addition of DSP READi,
DW SP READi, DIN F Li and DERV ARi until we reach the general form of PMG speci
Öcation (3). The gold standard is found to reduce yield spreads by 5.2 to 6.5 basis points
during the adjustment process. These variables were marginally insigniÖcant around the 10%
level, reáecting the large number of coe¢ cient estimated. This also applies to the rest of the
key explanatory variables as well. Given limited data at annual frequency, it is best to Öx at
least some short-run dynamic terms to be homogeneous across countries.
5 Conclusion
This paper has examined the determinants of sovereign yield spreads during the classical
Gold Standard era between 1872 and 1913, in a way that takes into account the dynamics
of investor perceptions of country risk. SpeciÖcally, the Pooled Mean Group methodology
is used to consistently estimate di§ering speeds of adjustment across a panel of twenty
two countries. One rationalisation of these di§ering speeds of response is that international
investors gradually updated their beliefs about the creditworthiness of di§erent countries at
di§erent speeds.
Our Öndings are supportive of the conventional ëseal of approvalíhypothesis about Gold
Standard membership. But by using the PMG methodology, we Önd that membership of
17As ÷zler (1989) observes, betas estimated with other variables are not strictly betas in the CAPM sense. Obstfeld and Taylor (2003) do not report their beta terms, so a comparison of results is not readily possible.

the gold standard did not have a direct impact on sovereign spreads to the exclusion of
other factors. Rather, the gold standard served as a short-hand device that facilitated a
countryís reputation in international capital markets. Investors remained concerned about
country-speciÖc fundamentals, such as ináation and the Öscal balance, but relied on the gold
standard to convey this information more swiftly. By enhancing the speed of adjustment of
sovereign spreads to their long-run equilibrium levels, gold standard membership facilitated
the e¢ cient pricing of sovereign risk.

The primary source of data is the Global Financial Database (GFD). The data has also been
corroborated against Flandreau and Zumer (2004), Obstfeld and Taylor (2003), and Mitchell
(various issues) for consistency. Where not available, other independent studies have been
used to Öll in missing series and gaps in observations. Variables in logarithm form are pre
Öxed with ìLî in front of the variableís name. Lagged variables are su¢ xed by ìLî at the
end. See Table (6) for summary statistics.

The following table presents the Örst-order autocorrelations of yields:
Exchange Rate (ER)
All exchange rates are from the GFD. The original series deÖnes exchange rate to be the
price of domestic currency per unit price of US dollars. Here, the year-end value is used and
the numeraire converted to sterling pounds.
Gold Standard (GS)
The gold standard dummy takes the value of one when the country has o¢ cially an
nounced adoption of de jure gold standard, otherwise it takes the value of zero. Experimen
tation was done interacting this dummy variable with full and partial default episodes. These
were taken from Obstfeld and Taylor (2003). The main source of gold standard coding is
from Bordo and Schwartz (1996), and corroborated against Meissner (2005). The coding for
the following countries were found to have discrepancies amongst various authors.
Austria: Flandreau and Zumer (2004) suggest Austria was on gold in 1896. Meissner
(2005), and Obstfeld and Taylor (2003) code this country as not having adopted the gold
standard until 1925.

Zumer (2004) and Önd a value for 1889.
Norway: In Braga de Macedo et al (1996), gold was adopted in 1875. The observation
for 1873 was obtained from Broz (2002). Thus, we record a dummy with value of one from
1873 onwards.
Spain: We use data from Meissner (2005).
Ináation (IN F L)
Ináation is measured as the year-on-year change in the CPI index. 1913 is used as the
base year. Data are collected from GFD, and missing series are taken from Flandreau and
Zumer (2004).

Fiscal Balance/GDP (F ISCGDP )
Fiscal balance = government revenue ñ government expenditure. The main source is
Mitchell (various issues). Government revenue refers to the current revenues exclusive of
loans, with their main tax constituents. Government (total) expenditures includes capital
items which are normally Önanced by borrowing. As argued in Mitchell, the most reluctant
omission has been any disaggregation of government expenditure. But this heterogeneous
data changes in nature frequently, and is often not available in a meaningful form.
Money Supply
M1 is deÖned as the sum of bank note in circulation and deposits in commercial banks.
M2 is the sum of M1 and deposits in savings. Source: Mitchell (various issues).
34


Australia: For currency/banknotes in circulation, the Australian dollar did not replace the
pound as the currency unit until the mid-1960s (2 dollars = 1 pound), the present currency
unit employed was in the sources used. Statistics to 1900 are at approximately the end of
December, and from 1901 to 1945 at the end of June. For demand deposits in commercial
banks, Ögures are the currency deposits of trading banks, and are at approximately the end
of December to 1900 and at the end of June from 1901 to 1949. For savings deposits, original
statistics are given in pounds. Australian dollars have been converted via the abovementioned
exchange rate. Deposits at the end of the Önancial year of each bank are dated mostly 30
June.
Austria: 1872-1913: National Bank issue (million gulden and million kroner, 2 kroner =
1 gulden). 1872 - 1895 was originally in gulden. This series was converted to kroner. From
1896 onwards, units in millions kroner. For deposits in savings banks, both regulated and
post o¢ ce savings banks have been summed up.
Belgium: For deposits in savings banks, both Caisse Generale díEpargne and post o¢ ce
savings banks have been summed up.
Denmark: Units in million rigsdaler. Deposits in savings are from all savings banks.
France: Units in million francs. For deposits in savings banks, both private savings banks
and national savings banks have been summed up.
Germany: Deposits in savings banks.
Greece: Deposits in savings banks.
India: From 1872 to 1873, Ögures are notes issued. From 1874 to 1913, Ögures are notes in
circulation. For demand deposits in commercial banks, Ögures are all non-government savings
in class A and exchange banks from 1872 to 1913. For savings deposits, Ögures to 1896 relate
to government savings banks, and subsequently they are of the Post O¢ ce Savings Bank.
Italy: For deposits in savings banks, both private savings banks and post o¢ ce savings
banks have been summed up.
Japan: For currency/banknotes in circulation, Ögures to 1959 relate to government notes,
35


national bank notes, Yokohama Specie Bank, and Bank of Japan notes (exclusive of those
held as reserves for other banksíissue. For demand deposits in commercial banks, Ögures to
1945 are of non-government current account deposits of national banks, special banks (from
1880), private ordinary banks (from 1893), and savings banks (from 1896).
Netherlands: For deposits in savings banks, both general savings banks and post o¢ ce
savings banks have been summed.
Portugal: There are missing values for 1876 and 1877. Linear interpolation was used to
Öll up the gaps.
Spain: Deposits in savings banks are from all savings banks.
Sweden: For deposits in savings banks, both private and post o¢ ce savings have been
summed up. M2 is the sum of money and quasi-money. Observations from between 1873
and 1875 were interpolated to arrive a value of M1 for 1974. .
United Kingdom: For deposits in commercial, data is only available for the UK. For
deposits in savings banks, both trustee savings banks and post o¢ ce savings banks have
been summed up. Thus for currency circulation, the UK data series was used.
Russia: For deposits in savings banks, this reáects all savings banks.
Total nominal public debt (DEBT )
The main source is Flandreau and Zumer (2004) for 1880 - 1913. These debt Ögures have
a wide deÖnition - covering both short and long term debt. Missing series are supplemented
by the following.
Australia: From Obstfeld and Taylor (2003).
Canada: From Statemanís Year Book (various issues).

United States: From Obstfeld and Taylor (2003).
Russia: From Feis (1930). Units: million rubles and measures the directly incurred debt
of the Russian government. The author also provides per cent held by foreigners.
Export
Data collected from GFDís Annual Files on World Trade. Note that these Ögures corre
spond to the export of manufactured goods. Original units in national currency.
Terms of Trade (T OT )
From Obstfeld and Taylor (2003) dataset. Missing for Netherlands and Russia.
Nominal GDP (GDP )
Sources include GFD, Mitchell (various issues) and Flandreau and Zumer (2004). Missing
series supplemented by:
India: from Goldsmith (1983).
Portugal: Real GDP from Mata and Valerio (1996). This original series is converted into
nominal terms using the GDP deáator (1994 = 100).
Exchange Rate Volatility (ERV AR)
Exchange rate variability is constructed using methodology following Flandreau and
Zumer (2004). The raw exchange rate (end of month) data was collected from GFD which
provides daily data in terms of open, high, low and close. The closing price of exchange rates
was used.

Custom Revenue (CU SREV )
Custom revenue is a component of central government revenue. Sources: Mitchell (various
issues).
Political Democracy (P OLIT Y 2)
The version of data used is from POLITY IV project available from http://weber.
ucsd.edu/~kgledits/Polity.html. Polity IV contain coded annual information on regimes
and authority characteristics for all independent states (with greater than 500,000 total
population) and covers the period 1800 ñ2002. Originally, political democracy is measured
by ëPolityí taking values between -10 and 10, where -10 denotes high autocracy and 10
denotes high democracy. When ëpolityícould not function properly, it is represented by (-88)
for transition period; (-77) for periods of interregnum (collapse of central political authority);
38


and (-66) for a period of interruption. However such classiÖcation is cumbersome for time
series analysis. As such, the new variable P OLIT Y 2 has been adopted, which adjusts these
dummies to generate a smoother time series.
War
War dummies are taken from the Correlates of War 2 (COW2) database available from
http://cow2.la.psu.edu/. W ARIN T ER refers to inter-state war while W ARIN T RA
refers to intrastate war.
B Diagnostic Tests
This appendix explains various diagnostic tests essential for the PMG procedure. Given that
this is a historical dataset and there are missing observations, this unbalanced panel dataset
is a challenge for the implementation of standard diagnostic tests. Instead of brute-force
applications, the following discusses how some tests were modiÖed.
B.1 Heteroskedasticity
As discussed in Baltagi (1995), the assumption of homoskedastic disturbances in the pres
ence of heteroskedasticity gives consistent but not e¢ cient estimates. This means that the
standard errors of estimates will be biased, leading to inaccurate statistical inference. The
problem can be rectiÖed by robust standard errors like in Obstfeld and Taylor (2003). But
these authors stop short of testing whether heteroskedasticity exists in the Örst place. The
presence of heteroskedasticity is assumed.
One of the tests for panel level heteroskedasticity involves conducting panel speciÖc itera
tive GLS procedure on the disturbance terms.18 This estimates panel level heteroskedasticity
and saves the likelihood function. Next, the estimated disturbances of the model are assumed
to be homoskedastic. A log-likelihood ratio (LR) test is performed to test these likelihood
18See http://www.stata.com/support/faqs/stat/panel.html.
39


functions with the degrees of freedom determined by the number of constraints imposed,
that is, the number of groupings. When this test was applied to the data, the estimation
under panel level heteroskedasticity yielded positive log-likelihood values. This reáects the
fact that the log-likelihood function is a probability density function instead of a probability
value. On the other hand, the log-likelihood estimate for homoskedastic errors is negative.
This results in unconventional negative LR test statistics.
In what follows, panel level heteroskedasticity is tested following the White test:
ubit = 1ybit + 2yb2
it
If the null hypotheses for 1 = 2 = 0 are not rejected, the disturbances are homoskedastic.
B.2 Unit Root Tests
The common tests are Levin and Lin (1992) and Im, Pesaran and Smith (2003, IPS hereafter).
Maddala and Wu (1999) compare these tests with the Fisherís tests and favor this simple test
to the abovementioned tests in terms of practical use. One of the restrictions of the Levin
and Lin test, and the IPS test is that they are only applicable to balanced panel dataset.
Similar to the tests here on heterogeneity, synthetic versions of unit root tests are devised,
based on discussion in Levin-Lin and IPS. The Levin-Lin test was conducted by pooling OLS
regressions to test for serial correlation, the following is estimated via OLS technique:
xit = xit 1 + i + it;
where xit is the variable of interest, and H0 : = 0. Rejection of the null hypothesis means
the variable is non-stationary and is I(1) in levels. To test for stationarity in di§erences,
xit = xit 1 + i + it:
40


Acceptance of the null hypothesis suggests the variable is stationary and is I(0) in di§erence.
Table (9) shows the Levin-Lin tests for the set of variables considered in our regressions.
The tests could not reject the null of panel unit root for log of terms of trade, log real GDP
per capita and log nominal GDP. One of the limitations of the Levin-Lin test is that is
assumed to be the same for all groups, that is, all countriesívariables converge at the same
rate. Since the dataset here includes countries with diverse experiences, it is not surprising
that unit root is violated for growth related variables.
As the Levin-Lin test is restrictive, the data is tested with the IPS test (see Table (10))
which relaxes the assumption that 1 = 2 = ::: = N . Instead of pooling the data, separate
unit root tests were performed on the N countries in the dataset. A test statistic based on
the average of an augmented Dickey-Fuller regression is computed. This is also known as the
LM t-bar test. Furthermore, this method is superior to Levin-Lin since it allows for residual
serial correlation, and heterogeneity of dynamics and error variances across groups. For both
tests, only Öxed e§ects without time trend are considered. Lag length was Öxed at one.

Note: * not signiÖcant at 5% level.
From Table (10), the null of panel unit root is not rejected for M2 to GDP ratio, debt to
GDP ratio, log real GDP per capita and log nominal GDP. Due to the heterogenous nature of
the IPS alternative hypothesis (that is, each i is di§erent), IPS (2003:74) suggest a rejection
of the null hypothesis does not necessarily imply that the null is rejected for all groups. So,
41


the presence of serial correlation may not a§ect the PMG analysis severely.

B.3 Panel Cointegration
Pedroni (1999) is the standard test but is designed for a balanced panel. Again, in view of
the unbalanced nature of the data, testing is done for the non-stationarity of residuals of
each regression. This takes the form of an augmented Dickey-Fuller test on the estimated
residuals following Cameron and Muellbauer (2001). Rejection of the null hypothesis suggests
the absence of serial correlation, and the existence of a long-run equilibrium.
