A tentative estimation of the Greek terms of
trade in the 19th century (1851-1914)
Socrates D. Petmezas
(University of Crete - IMS/FORTH)
George Dertilis, as an economic historian, has been instrumental in stimulating
and encouraging research on Greek historical statistics. Already in his first book1, he
had shown his active interest in the global quantitative picture of the 19th century
economy. Later, he collected and published in French reliable quantitative
demographic and economic data on the Greek 19th century economic history, making
them available to the international academic community2. His path-breaking book on
19th century budgets has demonstrated, beyond any doubt, that it was possible for
Greek historians to collect and assess long series of reliable data on the Greek
economy3. The ongoing research and publications on Greek historical statistics,
initially financed by the Historical Archives of the National Bank of Greece and later
also supported by the Centre for Planning and Economic Research, is in fact the
result of his relentless organising efforts and pragmatist vision. Without his visionary
realism, such a coordinated research group bringing together scholars, like Kostis,
Kostelenos and others, would have been impossible. The Gross Domestic Product,
public revenues and expenses, the Public Debt and Monetary data have been part of
this huge research project, whose end results are being actually published. Almost all
the available financial data of the Greek state have been collected and assessed. New
studies on Greek historical statistics are developing directly motivated and inspired by

History without underlining the pivotal role of George Dertilis.

Curiously, foreign trade statistics have been an exception, in spite of the fact
that official published data have been long available. The 19th century Greek foreign
trade statistics were assessed by Maria Synarellis twenty-five years ago. Her
postgraduate diploma in Paris has been the core of an innovative article4, which has
been limited to a handful of publications of primary data available in French libraries.
She has been able to identify both the major trend of Greek imports and exports and
the chronic deficit of Greek balance of trade, and to correctly grasp the composition
of the exported and imported goods in major categories (agricultural alimentary
products, agricultural and mineral raw materials, manufactures). Her work's major
flaw is that she picked as reference points, for calculating mean annual rates of
growth, commercial years that were not of the same character. She calculated rates of
growth between trough and peak years, instead of calculating consistently between
trough and trough or peak and peak years. Nevertheless, her estimates5 do not greatly
differ from my own estimates (Table 1). Furthermore, Synarellis didn’t address the
question of the fluctuation of the prices of imported and exported goods, and of the
possible evolution of the country’s terms of Trade. In this paper I will try to address
this task. A more precise view of the composition of imports and exports by major
category and by trade partner is given elsewhere6.

Data quality and limitations
The foreign trade statistics are notoriously untrustworthy, and this have been
widely known7. In general, any corpus of collected statistical data has always been
(and still is) liable to under- or over-evaluation. In reality, collected statistical data are
no more than tentative estimates of unknown real magnitudes. The choice and use of
price deflators to calculate values and indices, further aggravates the problem of the
precision and comparability of data. This shortfall is particularly exacerbated in the
case of trade statistics for two reasons.
1. Data on imported and exported goods are usually collected by toll officers
or authorities controlling the legal flows of trade. Any traffic of goods that bypasses
the controlled points of entry (i.e. the contraband trade) is not assessed. The higher the
tariffs the larger the incentive to escape legal transportation networks. This may,
accordingly, lead to serious under-evaluation of the volume of traded goods.
Furthermore, even if registered quantities are relatively precise, price deflators (i.e.
the estimated values of each unit of imported and exported goods) can only be gross
reflections of the real market prices. The values per unit of imported and exported
goods declared by the merchants themselves were of little practical use. Greek toll
authorities made use of ‘common’ price deflators for major imported and exported
goods every year. Furthermore, these deflators have not always been adjusted quickly
enough, to reflect the real change in the average annual prices in the import-export
markets. The steep plunge of the price of the exported currants, in August 1893, was
not officially taken into consideration in the publication of foreign trade statistics
before 1894, even though currants may have contributed to little less than half the
registered total value of Greek exports8.
2. Furthermore, the toll officers registered only the first port of destination, or
the last port of call, of all vessels leaving from, or arriving in, Greek ports9. This was

clearly reflected in the distribution of the country's trade partners, as observed in the
officially published data. In other words, the estimation of the percentage part of each
trade partner of Greece is untrustworthy, especially for the earlier years. This makes
the task of controlling the precision of Greek data (through comparison with foreign
trade data of its trade partners) more difficult.
These remarks are not meant to negate any utility to foreign trade statistics. On
the contrary, these are some of the most useful and meaningful statistical data
collections at our disposal. We must nonetheless stress the following points:
Registered volumes of exports and imports are more secure than their registered price
deflators (and their calculated values). Quality of data was improved in more recent
years, when statistical data have been more detailed and their precision can be more
easily checked.
One should add that, in the case of Spain, Portugal and the Ottoman Empire,
researchers have compared their respective official foreign trade statistical data with
relevant statistical data of their major trade partners, and have proven that the exports
of these three countries were under-estimated, and that consequently their trade
deficits (or surpluses) were also under- (or over-)estimated10. I do not know whether
this is also the Greek case, but I do not think that such a cross-examination of data
would change the fact that Greece ran a chronic trade deficit, or that the general trend
and the major fluctuations of imports and exports observed will be significantly
altered.
Data on Greek foreign trade consist of the annual “Tables of Foreign Trade”
for the Kingdom of Greece, published annually from 1858 to 1875 and from 1886 to
the present day. Foreign Trade Tables were published in the official Government
Journal since 1851, with the exception of the years 1855-5611. The ten years gap
(1876-1885), due to budgetary cuts that dismantled the official statistical service,
which created the annual statistical tables, is very partly recuperated by the
estimations of the Finance Ministry12 or the later publications of the Greek General
Statistical Service. Separate Foreign Trade Tables were published for the newly

annexed northern provinces for the years 1913-191513. Synarellis14 and Petrakis &
Panorios15 have only used a part of these published data to collect and build their data
series16. These series are not fundamentally different from those that I use in the
present article. My data series stems directly from the originally published data, and it
is corrected (or amended) when necessary17.
The price deflators provisionally adopted in this paper are those of the “Tables
of Foreign Trade”, in spite of their deficiencies. No other long term price series is
available. The data collected by Mitrophanis and Pizanias18 cover only a handful of
import and export products, for a smaller number of years, and cannot be used as an
adequate substitute for the ‘official’ price deflators. Ideally one should cross-check
Greek exports and imports to and from each foreign trade partner, with foreign trade
data originating from the statistical services of these ‘more advanced’ countries
(whose bureaucratic administrations were usually more efficient and better organized)
and establish a more complete and precise series of exchanged goods, in terms of
volume and price deflators. Of course, in this case the cost of freight and insurance

16 Petrakis and Panorios (op. cit., p.190-1), have made a useful contribution of providing a published
series of the total value of Greek Imports and Exports, which is based on publications of the Greek
General Statistical Service. It should be noticed that copying/typing errors for the years 1872 and
1906 were made, and they are important, because the trade deficit of these years is erroneously
transformed into a trade surplus!

should have been added to exports to Greece or subtracted from imports from
Greece19. This has not been done in our case. Our approach is thus a first effort to
estimate Greek Terms of Trade.
General trends
Greek export trade showed, on a per capita level, a rapid and relatively
constant growth until the late 1880s and the subsequent currant crisis (from 1893
onwards). From trough to trough the annual cumulated rate of growth was 5.97%
(1854-1888) and each trough is observed at a clearly higher level than the preceding
one20. Rising international demand for currants (and the few other labour-intensive
exported agricultural goods, like wine, olive oil and tobacco) was the prime mover of
this phenomenon. For their part, imports were mostly related to domestic income
fluctuations. Wheat, and other staple food (like pulses, colonial goods and salted fish),
formed the largest part of imports and, while having low income elasticity, may have
suffered from income depression since the early 1880s. The rise of imports, from
trough to trough, rose at about 4.42% from 1853 to 1880. The year 1880 was a turning
point since all subsequent troughs are observed at a lower level. It is obvious that the
Great Depression and, then, the economic crisis of the mid-1880s21, had its immediate
effects on the volume of imports, which show a falling trend from 1880 to 1893 (
2.88%). In the exports the turning point is the year 1888 and exports fall
precipitously: -10.24% between 1888 and 1893. Both imports and exports resume
their upward moving trend after 1893, but they would never again show the explosive
dynamism of the earlier three or four decades. The rate of growth of imports and
exports between 1893 and 1909 is 1.69% and 2.29% respectively (from trough to

Production, Cambridge, Cambridge University Press, 1987, appendices 1 and 2, for an example and
discussion. More detail is offered in S.Pamuk, Trade, Foreign capital and the peripheralization of
the Ottoman Empire, 1830-1913, unpublished Ph.D., University of California, Berkeley, 1978.
20 We have calculated all values and prices in terms of Latin Monetary Union drachmas, which was in
metal content equal to the French franc.
21 Since 1885, the Greek banking sector greatly reduced the volume credit offered to merchants, cf.

Bank] Athens, Cultural Foundation of the National Bank of Greece, 1981, p.273 sq.

trough). In the long run, exports rose 75% faster than imports (exports per capita rose
at a rate of 3.43% annually, between 1854-1909, as against 1.94% for imports,
between 1853-1909 ) (see Figure 1). This periodisation differs little from the one
observed by Pamuk22 in the Ottoman case. The only difference stems from the fact
that Greek exports continued unabated in the 1880s, thanks to the rising French
demand for inedible currants and other raw materials for their wine industry, while the
Ottoman exports felt the impact of Great Depression immediately after 1873.
Figure 1 The per capita value of Greek imports and exports (in Latin Monetary Union
Drachmas per capita)
I have elsewhere insisted on the fact that this last (post 1893) period must be
clearly dissociated from the earlier one (ca.1850-1893) in one more respect. In the
earlier period the value of international trade23 as a percentage of the Gross Domestic
Product steadily rose to exceed 20% in ca.1880 (higher than other more developed
Mediterranean countries)24. On the contrary, in the post-1893 period, this percentage
fell and remained lower than the comparative index of other Mediterranean countries,
in spite of the fact that Greece experienced a period of rapid output and income
growth. The earlier high percentage of international trade per GDP was not a mark of
the growing integration of the country into the world markets, but of the relatively
low level of internal market integration.
The steady long term growth of Greek export trade in the larger part of the 19th
century (1850-1890) was due to a few export goods, mainly labour intensive
agricultural products and some minerals, which were traded for manufactures,
colonial goods and land intensive staple agricultural products. Greece ran a large
general trade deficit, but it also had a steady agricultural trade surplus25. The structure
of the Greek international trade was based on a relatively small number of goods and
changed little over time in this period. All this makes it relatively safe to estimate the
terms of trade.
22 Cf. Pamuk, Ottoman Empire..., pp.27-36.
23 I define international trade as the sum of imports and exports divided by two. In Greece with its
chronic trade deficit it is always higher in value than exports and lower than imports alone.

Estimating the Greek terms of trade
Usually, the terms of trade for countries with a large number of imported and
exported goods change little over time because any radical change in the price of an
imported or exported item has little effect on the overall price index. On the contrary,
in a small country, like the 19th century Kingdom of Greece, whose international
trade depended on only a few exchanged items (currants, wine, olive oil, wheat and
some minerals) any significant change in the price or demand of one or two products
had a large impact on the overall value of imports and exports and subsequently may
have caused important income effects.
Likewise, the fact that only a few products covered the greatest part of the
aggregate value of imports and (especially of) exports of Greece, makes it easier to
estimate its terms of trade. In the exports side, I have chosen eleven agricultural goods
(currants, tobacco, olive oil, olives, wine, dry figs, valonia oak, cocoons, silk, hides
and leather26) and six minerals (all of them present only after 1887) covering in
average 88% of the registered value of exports in the period 1851-191227. Currants
alone cover in average 42% of the registered value28.
Unfortunately, in the imports side, I have only been able to include ten items
that cover in average a meagre 43% of the value of imports29. These items include six
agricultural goods (cereals, rice, pulses, hides, cotton and leather), two colonial goods
(sugar, coffee) and two combustibles (coal, petrol). Imported cereals cover in average
24% of all imports in value. Unfortunately, no manufacturing goods have been
included. We can safely, I believe, presume that the unit price of imported
manufactured goods tended to stagnate or fall as productivity gains in the industrial
26 Leather and silk may also be considered as manufactured goods
27 The minimum percent of coverage is 57%, in 1914, and the maximum is 99% in 1904. The 6
mineral exports were included only after 1887. Yet they did not fundamentally change the
percentage covered or the general trend and fluctuations of the calculated terms of trade. See Table
A.1 in annex.
28 This estimate is made for the years 1851-4, 1857-77, 1881-2 and 1884-1914.
29 The minimum percent of coverage is 25%, in 1914, and the maximum is 54% in 1871. See Table
A.1 in annex. Kuznets has considered 40% to be the strict minimum for such historical-statistical
estimates, cf. Pamuk, Ottoman Empire..., p.255.

countries were, even partly, translated in lower, more competitive, prices30. Thus, let’s
keep in mind that the price index of imported manufactures should have been
decreasing in the long run.
The number and character of items included and percent of value covered are
satisfactory in the export side and relatively representative in the import side. It is of
particular interest that two items, currants in exports and cereals in imports, cover a
large part of the overall value of exports and imports respectively. Currants covered
on average 42% of the value of exports and cereals 24% of imports respectively31, and
can be used as proxies for a rough estimation of the price indices and terms of trade.
Thus, I have substituted currants and cereals for the total value and prices of
aggregate exports and imports for the years of missing data (1876-1886). It is
noteworthy that the general trend and fluctuations of the substitute indices do not
differ enormously from that of the estimated net barter terms of trade (see Figure 2).
Figure 2 The net barter terms of trade.
The long run trend of the Greek terms of trade
The general trend of the net barter terms of trade is determined by the ratio of
the price indices of export and import goods. We can see that the price index of
imports (Pm) grows steadily until ca.1875 (see table A.1 and figure 3). When
detailed data are again available, since 1887, this price index follows a mild falling
trend until the final years before the First World War. Using the price index of
imported cereals as proxy we get more or less the same trend, and we can assume that
the shift of the trend began in ca. 1875, probably because of falling freight rates. This
price index does not include manufactured goods which have probably followed a
30 This does not necessarily mean that all the gains from productivity growth in the exporting
countries are transferred to the importing ones, through the concomitant decrease of the prices of
manufactures. On the contrary, Pamuk (Ottoman Empire..., p.47-8) has shown that in the Ottoman
case European manufacturers and workers skimmed almost all the gains from such productivity
increase. An estimate of the double factoral terms of trade (moving in favour of countries exporting
manufactures) would eventually have demonstrated this fact.
31 Wheat steadily covered almost 85% of all imported cereals, but since we lack data on imported
wheat until 1872, I have decided to stick with the aggregate volume and value of imported cereals.

falling trend all along32. On the contrary, the price index of exports (Px) fluctuates
abruptly and is heavily influential on the overall behaviour of the net barter terms of
trade, especially after 1887.
Figure 3 The volume and price indices of imports and exports
In the long run, the net barter terms of trade shows a falling trend until the late
1860s and then rises gently for a decade. The 1880s is a period of abrupt fluctuations
(as far as the substitute net barter terms of trade index can show) which ends in the
catastrophic currant crisis that heavily depressed currant prices for half a decade. The
net barter terms of trade regains its stamina and gradually grows, until the beginning
of the second decade of the 20th century. This time the price of the new mineral
exports (whose part in the total value of exports expanded) were more influential in
the export price index than the price of currants33.
In the long run, the evolution of the Greek net barter terms of trade in the 19th
century does not follow the presumed pathway of depreciation of agricultural exports
and appreciation of industrial imports, which should turn against the so-called
peripheral countries. This is hardly a surprise anymore. Jeffrey Williamson has
recently insisted that the negative trend (observed by Prebisch and others in the
1950s) is only produced after the turn of the 20th century. The volatility of the
fluctuations of the index around its trend is according to this author of far greater
importance in explaining the divergence among developed and underdeveloped
peripheral economies34. The volatility of the Greek export price index (and
32 Once again, this is only a speculative hypothesis that needs to be verified. The data on 19 th century
prices, published by Pizanias and Mitrophanis (op.cit., p1052 and pp.1062-63), offer us only
relatively long series of current drachma prices of blue and yellow “strantza” tissues in the market of
Piraeus, since 1884 and 1895 respectively. If we deflate the prices and express them in golden terms
(in French Francs) they both show a rising trend since circa 1896. The available data on blue
‘strantza” tissues, indicate a previous falling trend from 1884 to 1896. For the ottoman case and the
price index of imported textile manufactures, which is showing a falling trend, cf. Pamuk, Ottoman
Empire..., p.174-5: Table A2.2.
33 This makes the substitute net barter terms of trade much less representative of the overall movement
of the index in the post 1893 period than before that date.
34 Cf. J.Williamson, “Globalization and the Great Divergence: terms of trade booms, volatility and the
poor periphery, 1782–1913”, European Review of Economic History, 12/3 (2008), pp.355–391.

consequently of the net barter terms of trade) points to this direction, but this question
can not be raised in this paper.
Furthermore, Greece is not a good example of a peripheral economy exporting
low value added agricultural and importing high value added industrial goods. The
country was also a major importer of land-intensive agricultural products and an
exporter of labour intensive agricultural products. Its major export product, currants (a
quasi natural monopoly), was favoured by a relatively inelastic international demand
protecting it, from abrupt fluctuations of the exported volume of currants, until the
1890s35.
Figure 4 The income terms of trade
In fact, until the early 1890s, Greek trade suffered from the price volatility of
its major export good (currants) but this did not hamper its volume growth (Qx),
which seems to increase until 1890 (see figure 3). The income terms of trade,
produced by multiplying the net barter terms of trade by the estimated volume of
exports index (Qx), measures the gains (or losses) of a country from foreign trade. In
the Greek case, the income terms of trade followed an ascending trend until the
outbreak of the currant crisis (see figure 4).
The currant crisis led to a complete reverse of the trend. Between 1891 and
1895, the income terms of trade fell by almost 50%! This measures correctly the
extremely harsh impact of the adverse evolution of prices and the chronic diminution
of the volume of exported currants. The income terms of trade stagnated until 1903
and begun their rapid ascent after 1903-1905. The evolution of the income terms of
trade after 1900 is decoupled from the evolution of its substitute index (which, I
repeat, is produced using solely the currant export trade as proxy). Once again (as in
the case of the net barter terms of trade) the export trade of currants provided, since
the beginning of the 20th century, the pattern of short term fluctuations but not the
growth trend of the income terms of trade.
The above-mentioned evolution is a clear signal of gradual, yet real, changes
in the Greek foreign trade. Greek export trade became less dependent on just one
product (currants). At the same time the ratio of the value of international trade to the

gross domestic product slightly regressed, because foreign trade grew less rapidly
than the domestic output. The national market of goods and services became more
integrated, while the economy remained strongly related to international markets.
Greece profited from world trade more than the Ottoman Empire, in spite of the fact
that it depended excessively on just one product for the whole 19th century. This
favourable development was most probably due to the capacity of the Greek
economy, in the beginning of the 20th century, to reply more adequately to the
challenges of international markets and, thus, to maintain its modest position in the
international division of labour. This again is a story best explained by George
Dertilis36, himself, than anyone else.
