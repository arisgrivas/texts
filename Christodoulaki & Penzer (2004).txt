News from London: Greek Government Bonds on the London Stock
Exchange, 1914-1929*
Olga Christodoulaki &Jeremy Penzer
Abstract
Statistical analysis of Greek sovereign debt denominated in gold and traded on the London Stock Exchange from the outbreak of the First World War until the advent of the Great Depression is employed to explore the way that historical events including political and institutional changes shaped investors’ expectations of the capacity of the Greek government to honour its debt obligations. No a priori specification of important dates is made. Military defeat and its aftermath exerted a strong negative impact on the value of Greek sovereign debt. The statistical analysis shows that investors acted upon news of public debt, fiscal performance and money supply. Unforeseen political events also influenced bondholders’ expectations over future payments. By contrast, institutional innovations such as the adoption of the Gold Exchange Standard and the establishment of a central bank de novo did not produce any quantitative market response. Stabilisation and the concomitant institutional reforms however, were factored into the market price of Greek sovereign debt traded in London.

1. Introduction
‘Greece has always lived beyond her resources’.1 Not only has she
borrowed heavily but by 1932 she had defaulted on her sovereign debt four
times.2 As a consequence the country experienced financial embargoes,
foreign intervention into its monetary policy and control of its fiscal revenues.
A Byzantine relationship arose between Greek governments and foreign
financial markets, making an historical examination of the way that market
prices of Greek government bonds fluctuated even more compelling.
The aim of this paper is to explore the way that historical events
including political and institutional changes shaped investors’ expectations of
the capacity of the Greek government to honour its debt obligations. The
underlying assumption is that information that affects a security's expected
pay-off is incorporated into its price.3 Hence, this work contributes to a
recently growing literature which combines historical data with statistical
evidence, to study the way that news interacts with capital markets to
determine asset prices.4
Four time series of Greek government loans denominated in gold and
traded on the London Stock Exchange, have been constructed to
demonstrate movements in the price of Greek government bonds on the
London market. Three of the time series, that of the Monopoly Loan, the

Bonds Loan and the 1914 Loan are from monthly data and span the period
from the outbreak of the First World War until the advent of the Great
Depression. The fourth time series, that of the Refugee Loan, represents
daily observations and covers the period from 1925 until 1929. The period in
question is historically complex. For Greece in particular it includes wars,
military triumph and final defeat as well as political and monetary upheaval.
It ends with Greece experiencing, albeit short-lived, political and monetary
stability.
This is the first time that market prices of Greek government loans
have been compiled and presented in such a systematic way.5 The data
was collected by hand from the Investor’s Monthly Manual and the Stock
Exchange Daily Official List and has been considered in isolation from its
historical context. No a priori specification of important dates was made. A
structural model was employed to identify the location of two types of
unusual behaviour in the time series under consideration, namely outliers
and level shifts.
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2
provides a brief history of the period under consideration while in Section 3
the data employed are described. In Section 4 research into the British press
demonstrates that information about developments in Greece was available
to investors in the London market. The method followed in the statistical
analysis is developed in Section 5 and the results are presented. In Section
6 the unusual points located in the time series are discussed and correlated
with news that shifted investors’ expectations. The findings of the statistical

analysis are also related to historical events that played a prominent role in
the political and economic historiography of the period in question and to the
news on Greece in the British press that the Council of the Corporation of
Foreign Bondholders collected to assess the creditworthiness of the Greek
government. The paper finishes with some concluding remarks.
2. Historical Context
When the guns fell silent on the western front late in 1918, Greece
was on the victorious side and her government was led by Eleftherios
Venizelos, an able and forceful statesman. ‘Unprecedented prosperity and
reckless optimism’6 prevailed as the end of the Great War coincided with
territorial expansion and economic prosperity. The creation of a Greater
Greece in the Near East, a long-standing national aspiration that had been
embraced by most political leaders since Independence, seemed within
reach. In May 1919 Greek troops disembarked in Smyrna and the Treaty of
Sévres granted Greece sovereignty over Thrace as far as the Chatalja line.
At that time the drachma maintained its pre-war parity and had become a
symbol of the economic vigour of the country.
Careful analysis however, shows up contradictory evidence of
macroeconomic weakness. Between 1914 and 1919 the price level had
more than tripled and the currency in circulation had increased by more than
fivefold. The increase in the money supply did not raise any concern with
the monetary authorities who believed at the time that the stability of the
drachma was indisputable. This faith in the stability of the drachma was
based on the operation of a law, introduced in 1910, which authorised the

Issuing Bank to increase the currency in circulation on the condition that
these freshly printed banknotes were fully covered by foreign exchange.
This law known as ‘GXMB’, was used by the government to finance active
participation in the Great War. Under an agreement signed in early 1918,
Britain, France and the United States opened book credits in equal shares to
the Greek government to a total value of 750 million French francs.7 On the
strength of these Book Credits the National Bank of Greece printed banknotes
that were used by the government to meet the expenses of the armed forces
during 1918. These Book Credits could be drawn upon by the Greek
government from their Allies six months after the conclusion of peace.
The jubilation of victory at the end of the war temporarily concealed
the extent of the national schism created by the Great War.8 This schism
had literally divided the country into two; the Premier of the country
Eleftherios Venizelos, had aspired to a policy of intervention on the side of
the Allies while the King had been in favour of the country remaining neutral.
The Premier believed in the final victory of the Entente which would bring
territorial gains to Greece whilst the King had faith in the military supremacy
of Germany. This crisis had come to a head in 1916-17. King Constantine
was forced to leave the country and in June 1917, the Venizelos government
declared war on the central powers .
A few months after the signing of the Treaty of Sévres, in November
1920 Venizelos was overwhelmingly defeated in a general election.9 This
general election that brought the Populist Party to power together with the
7 In May 1919 a supplementary agreement was signed and a further 100 million French francs of Book Credits were granted to Greece by the Allies under the same terms and conditions as those of the 1918 agreement. 8 For more see Bochotis, "Domestic Policy," pp. 83-95; and Yanoulopoulos, "Foreign Policy," pp. 125-129. 9 For more see Bochotis, "Domestic Policy," p. 98-100; and Yanoulopoulos, "Foreign Policy," p. 132.

unexpected death of the young King Alexander who had succeeded his
father, paved the way for the return of the exiled King Constantine to Athens.
Following a referendum held on 22nd November (Julian)/5th December
(Gregorian)10 1920, King Constantine was officially returned to the Greek
throne. Immediately, the Allied governments warned Athens that the
repatriation of King Constantine meant that they were no longer bound by the
Treaty of Sévres. Greece would also encounter a financial embargo and
cancellation of the Book Credits.11 Political historiography and military
sources correlate subsequent events in Asia Minor with the return of King
Constantine to the Greek throne. Careful examination, however, of
geopolitical developments in the area late in 1920 does not support the view
that the outcome of the election had a catalytic effect on the course of
history.12 Economic history literature on the period links the cancellation of
the Book Credits with the depreciation of the drachma and the difficulties the
country faced in raising capital from the financial markets in the 1920s.13 With
hindsight, the return of the exiled King to Athens, served as an excuse on the
part of the Allies to cancel the Book Credits at a time when their domestic
preoccupations prevailed over international agreements.
The Greek army marched into the interior of Asia Minor meeting little
resistance but giving time to Mustapha Kemal to prepare his army for an
10 At the time, Greece was following the Julian calendar which lagged 13 days behind the Gregorian that was used by almost all of the rest of Europe. Greece introduced the Gregorian calendar on 16th February 1923, which became 1st March. During the period in question when Greece was following the Julian calendar dates are given on both calendars. It should be emphasized that the data collected, both the time series employed and the press cuttings gathered, come from London publications where the Gregorian calendar was followed.

attack. In August 1922, the army of Ataturk launched its final offensive.14
Hundreds of thousands of people fled the Turkish advance. Many of them
headed to Smyrna believing that they would be protected there. On 27th
August (Julian)/9th September (Gregorian), the Turkish army entered
Smyrna in pursuit. What followed is vividly described in history books and in
the press of the day. The panic and desperation culminated on 31st August
(Julian)/13th September (Gregorian) when Smyrna was set on fire. A mass
of destitute refugees, allegedly 300,000 people, had already gathered at the
port, desperately seeking any kind of craft on which to escape the horror.15
Hundreds of thousands of refugees, chiefly women, children and old men
reached Piraeus or the Greek islands near Asia Minor. In January 1923, the
Treaty of Lausanne provided for a compulsory exchange of populations
between Greece and Turkey, recognising in this way, an event that to a
great extent had already occurred.16 In a very short period of time, the
population of Greece increased by twenty per cent.17
The ‘Catastrophe,’ as the Asia Minor debacle is known in Greece, had
an immediate impact upon Greek politics. A military faction of officers,
supporters of Venizelos, formed a Revolutionary Committee, deposed the
Royalist government in Athens and assumed power on 15th (Julian)/28th
September (Gregorian) 1922. King Constantine was forced to abdicate, this
time in favour of his eldest son, and left Athens for the last time.
At first private initiative and philanthropic organisations provided relief
for refugees. However, it soon became apparent that huge resources would

be needed for the settlement of more than a million of people that had
crossed the Aegean Sea from Asia Minor. As Figures 1, 2, and 3 show, the
creditworthiness of the Greek government on the London market was very
low late in 1922. In London, market rates of Greek public debt had rocketed
to nearly 22 per cent, reflecting the political, economic and financial distress
that prevailed in Athens. In February 1923 Greece approached the Council
of the League of Nations hoping to float an international loan under their
aegis for the settlement of refugees. The negotiations with the League were
protracted and a Geneva Protocol was only signed in September 1923.18
The League scheme that was implemented in Greece as a result, was
mainly confined to the settlement of refugees. For this purpose, an
autonomous organisation was established, namely the Refugee Settlement
Commission. This handled the proceeds of the First Refugee Loan and was
made responsible for the settlement of refugees primarily in rural areas.19
The period that followed the Asia Minor campaign is characterised by
political and monetary instability.20 One short-lived government after another
assumed the governance of the country until June 1925 when General
Pangalos with the help of a few officers seized power and established a
dictatorship. Fourteen months later, General Pangalos was himself
overthrown by a military coup d’etat organised by another officer, General
Condylis. Condylis immediately declared himself in favour of a return to
normal political conditions by holding parliamentary elections. In December
1926 and for the first time since 1915, Venizelists and Anti-Venizelists,
Republicans and Monarchists co-operated and formed a coalition

government. The priority that united these politicians, in spite of their deep
rooted differences, was the stabilisation of the drachma, the Greek currency
having lost approximately 95 per cent of its pre-war value by mid-December
1926.
The Greek authorities resorted to the League of Nations for a second
time, in the spring of 1927 in order to obtain an international loan under its
auspices to stabilise the drachma and to continue the work with the refugees.
The reconstruction scheme prepared by the Financial Committee was a
typical League stabilisation plan, comprising institutional reforms focused
mainly on the central banking system and the flotation of an international loan.
In the Greek example, however, there was a domestic twist on the League’s
norms; reorganisation of the issuing bank in Greece as recommended by the
Financial Committee led to the establishment of a fully-fledged central bank
de novo, the Bank of Greece which opened its doors for business on 14th
May 1928, two days after the drachma was de jure stabilised.21 Prior to this,
on 31st January, the flotation of a Stabilisation Loan was launched
simultaneously in London and New York. This loan is also known as the
Tripartite Loan as one third of the proceeds was allocated to repaying a part
of the state debt to the central bank and in this way to strengthen its reserve
position. Another third was used for paying off outstanding budget arrears
and the remainder was allocated to the further settlement of the refugees.
3. Overview of the Data
Four times series, each representing a Greek Government loan
denominated in gold and traded on the London market which was the most

important borrowing market for the Greek government in the 1920s, have
been compiled for the purpose of the analysis in this paper. The data are
hand-collected from sources extensively used by contemporaneous market
participants to assess the creditworthiness of the Greek government. The
four Greek Government loans employed are presented in Table 1. They are
the Monopoly Loan of 1887, the Bonds Loan issued in 1910, the five per cent
Loan of 1914 and the Refugee Loan of 1924. The first three time series cover
the period from 1914 until June 1930, are monthly observations and have
been collected from the Investor's Monthly Manual, 1914-1930. The
observations represent the latest price as a percentage of par value quoted at
the end of each month on the London Stock Exchange. The last time series,
that of the Refugee Loan are daily observations and come from the Stock
Exchange Daily Official List.22 This time series starts on 29th April 1925, the
first day that the Refugee Loan was traded on the London Stock Exchange
and finishes on 31st December 1929. The data gathered represent each
day’s final transaction. If the number of transactions that took place each
day is used as a yardstick, then the seven per cent Greek Refugee Loan
was one of the most popular loans on the London market during the period
in question. Moody’s Manual of Investments which at the time furnished
investors with ‘a key to the relative security and stability of particular
investment bonds,’ valued the Refugee Loan as a safer investment than the
other three Greek loans examined. Under their system of ratings, the
Refugee Loan carried a ‘Baa’ rating whilst the Monopoly Loan, the Bonds
Loan and the 1914 Loan carried a ‘Ba’.23 The four time series constructed
are plotted on Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4.

The loans used were issued at different historical points primarily to
finance the budget deficits of the Greek government and the rearmament of
the country.24 The only notable exception is the Refugee Loan, the proceeds
of which were used for the settlement of refugees that came to the country
after the Asia Minor debacle. All four loans contained several features
designed to minimise the risk of default and to ensure smooth repayment.
These loans were denominated in gold and were paid off semi-annually

according to the terms of their contracts. In spite of the economic and
monetary turmoil in the country, the Greek government serviced its debt
obligations according to the terms and conditions applied throughout the
period. In fact, a 19th century institution, the International Financial
Commission (I.F.C.), was responsible for the service of the loans used in this
paper. The I.F.C. was established in 1898 by the ‘Law of Control’ that was
introduced following the Greek government’s default of 1893. It was an
international body and its members were originally appointed by the
governments of Great Britain, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy and
Russia.25 This Commission assumed responsibility for the service of the
Greek public debt that was placed under its jurisdiction. Accordingly, the
Greek government assigned a large part of its public revenues to the I.F.C.
and the latter administered these in accordance with the terms of the ‘Law of
Control’.26
25 After 1921, the I.F.C. was confined to members of Great Britain, France and Italy. 26 Wynne, State Insolvency, pp. 320-25; Andreades, Works, pp.482-86; and "Greek Law of Control," pp. 11-13.

The ‘Law of Control’ introduced a rescheduling of public debt
contracted before 1897. The debt readjustment plan that was developed
defined the minimum interest rate to be paid to the bondholders of the
Monopoly Loan at 43 per cent of the original interest rate of this loan. In other
words the minimum interest rate that the I.F.C. should pay the holders of the
Monopoly Loan was 1.73 per cent. The I.F.C. however, aimed at increasing
both the interest paid and the sinking fund for the loans under its control to
their full contractual level using public revenues earmarked for this purpose.
The rate of interest paid to holders of bonds of the Monopoly Loan during the
period in question, exceeded the minimum interest rate fixed by the ‘Law of
15


Control’ and varied from year to year according to the disposable revenues of
the Commission.27 Bondholders were informed via announcements in the
British press in February or March each year of the additional coupon rate or
plus value as it was known to investors, that the I.F.C. would pay on top of the
minimum rate fixed by the ‘Law of Control’.28 Customarily the plus value was
payable on the coupon of the first half of the year on the strength of the
surplus revenue of the year before. The interest rate paid to Monopoly Loan
bondholders during the period in question is presented in Appendix I, and as
Table A11 shows the interest paid in 1920 and 1921 was at the full
contractual level for the first time since the introduction of the ‘Law of Control’.
Subsequently, it retained either its original level or remained close to that
level.
The Bonds Loan was issued in 1910; its interest rate was four per cent
and the amortisation period fifty years. Although this loan was secured by tax
revenues assigned to the I.F.C., it was not placed under their direct control.29
In accordance with the terms of the Bonds Loan the Greek government could
increase the drawings or pay off the whole loan at par after January 1921.
The five per cent Loan of 1914 was the largest borrowing operation that
Greece had entered into, prior to the outbreak of the Great War. After the
Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 the country was in urgent need of capital not only
to liquidate the floating debt incurred during the war years, but to provide for
27 The coupon rate thus paid to the Monopoly Loan bondholders fluctuated within a band from 1.73 to 4 per cent, from year to year, depending on the volume of the surplus revenues of the I.F.C. For this reason, the Monopoly Loan is not suitable for assessing sovereign risk after the introduction of the ‘Law of Control’. See for example Obstfeld and Taylor, "Sovereign Risk," p. 256 and p. 269. 28 See Council of the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders, Greek Extracts, vol. 6th (27th October 1904-25th September 1916); and Council of the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders, Greek Extracts, vol. 7th (25th September 1916-31st October 1931). 29 Wynne, State Insolvency, p. 348; Andreades, Works, pp. 552-54; Aggelopoulos, Public Debt, p. 30; and Stefanides, The Inflow of Foreign Capital, pp. 202-03.

administrative expenses in the newly annexed territories and to carry out
infrastructure programmes.30 The sum of £19,850,000 or 500,000,000 French
francs was authorised but in the end owing to the outbreak of the Great War
only £13,402,960 was issued. From the total amount issued 51.84 per cent
was reserved for Paris, 12.59 per cent was reserved for London and 9.63 per
cent for New York, Athens and Egypt.31 The remaining 25.95 per cent of the
total amount issued was given by the government to the National Bank of
Greece, the central bank in the country prior to 1928.32 In this way, the
government cleared part of its debt to the Bank of Issue. The 1914 Loan was
placed under the direct control of the I.F.C. and its service was secured
against additional tax revenues assigned to the Commission. The Greek
government reserved the option of redeeming the whole or any part of the
loan after March 1924.
The Refugee Loan was issued under the auspices of the League of
Nations late in 1924. This loan was raised to provide funds for the settlement
of refugees that came to the country after the Asia Minor debacle. A special
body, the Refugee Settlement Commission, was established to administer the
proceeds of this loan. The Refugee Settlement Commission was an
autonomous body, its statutes having been developed by the Financial

A substantial part of the loan (£7,500,000) was issued in London. The rest
was floated in almost equal parts in Athens and New York.
Archival material shows that policymakers in Greece observed the
market price movements of the 1914 Loan and the Bonds Loan in order to
evaluate the creditworthiness of the country on the London market.35 It also
reveals that the National Bank of Greece, possibly in co-operation with the
government, attempted to manipulate the market prices of Greek bonds twice
during the period in question.36 Certainly an organised intervention by the
National Bank began in September 1924, a couple of months before the
flotation of the Refugee Loan.37 A second intervention seems to have been
planned to coincide with the issue of the Stabilisation Loan.38 The available
information on these two market adjustments is summarised in Table 2.

4. Developments in Greece: The Fleet Street Perspective
The main objective of this work is to use historical statistics to
evaluate market response to news. Analysis of the statistical results,
however, presupposes that research into the press establishes how well
informed market participants in London were about developments in Greece.
As information is by nature asymmetric, only research into the press of the
period in question will eliminate asymmetries of information between present
day economic historians attempting to answer the kind of questions posed in
this paper and contemporaneous investors. Economic historians have the
benefit of ex post historical information established by research into archival
material that might have not been available to the period’s contemporaries.
Research into the press of the period will verify the timing of information,
19


which was important to market actors in evaluating country risk, being
disclosed by policy makers to the public.
The Council of the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders, besides
publishing an Annual Report, systematically collected invaluable information
from the British press on countries at the centre of their interest. This
published material, tracked down in a wide range of mainly daily press, was
neatly organized in a continuous format in the form of cutting books.39 The
material on Greece consists of nine volumes, covering the period from 1867
until January 1971. Volumes six and seven, full of information that appeared
in the British press during the period in question, have been used for the
purposes of this article.40 In addition to the Greek Extracts, the Economist of
the period and the Times of 1922 were examined.41
The Greek Extracts provide ample evidence that British investors were
able to be well informed about developments in Greece and promptly. They
also indicate the kind of qualitative information that an investors’
organisation whose principal objective was ‘the protection of the interests of
the holders of foreign securities’42 observed to evaluate the creditworthiness
of a country, in this case Greece. The information that is collected in the
Greek Extracts is presented in Tables 3 and 4 and Table A12.
39 These volumes, adding up to a total of 503 volumes, are kept at the Guildhall Library, London. The cuttings are almost entirely in English, taken primarily from British daily newspapers, the weeklies and the financial press. 40 Council of the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders, Greek Extracts [hereafter Greek Extracts], vol. 6th (27th October 1904-25th September 1916); and Council of the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders, Greek Extracts [hereafter Greek Extracts], vol. 7th (25th September 1916-31st October 1931). The cuttings that appear in these two volumes come from the Times, Financial News, Financial Times, Morning Post, Daily Telegraph, Board of Trade Journal, Stock Exchange Journal, Stock Exchange Gazette and Evening Standard. There is also a small number of cuttings from the Message d’Athenes.

Notes: (1) This table shows the absolute number of press cuttings on Greece, per month and per year, that were gathered in
the Greek Extracts. (2) The number of press cuttings gathered for the first six months of the year is generally higher than that
for the second half. (3) The total number of cuttings for the first half of 1914 is considerably higher than the average number
observed during the first six months of each subsequent year during the period in question and is, to a large extent, explained
by the flotation of the 1914 Loan which attracted a lot of publicity in the press. In addition, the number of press cuttings
clustered as ‘National Issues’ in Table 4 during the first semester of 1914 is substantial both in comparison with other years and
the second part of 1914. (4) 1922 is the year of the Asia Minor debacle.

Table 3 shows the absolute number of press cuttings per month and
per year that the Greek Extracts include during the period under
examination. Table 4 illustrates the wide range of issues covered by the
press cuttings in the Greek Extracts. It also shows the wealth of issues
associated with Greece that the British press thought worthy of coverage. At
the same time, Table 4 indicates the kind of news that the Council
considered important in evaluating the creditworthiness of the Greek
government.
The system employed to compose this table was to read the Greek
Extracts and then divide the issues tackled in the cuttings into categories.
Often, one press cutting refers to more than one topic related to Greece.
For this reason the total of Table 4 is different from the total of Table 3 which
is simply the number of press cuttings per year that the volumes include.

Notes: (1) The system employed to compose this table was to read the Greek Extracts and then divide the issues tackled in the
cuttings into categories. One press cutting related to Greece may refer to more than one issue. For this reason the total of
observations in Table 4 is different from the total of Table 3 which shows the absolute number of press cuttings per year
included in the Greek Extracts.
(2) ‘National Issues’ is a generic term that contains news on foreign diplomacy, reports on Greek minorities in the Near East and
the Balkans, Greek War debts as well as the issue of Book Credits and rearmament.
25


(3) Cuttings grouped as ‘National Issues’ in 1914 refer mainly to minority issues of Greek populations in surrounding areas not
belonging to Greece and to a strained relationship between Greece and Turkey. In 1925, 1926 and 1927 ‘National Issues’
includes news on the negotiations for the settlement of War Debts with Great Britain, France and the United States.
(4) News in the Greek Extracts on the macroeconomic situation in Greece are divided into the following categories: Economic
Conditions where general references on economic progress and development have been classified; Primary Sector, containing
information on agriculture and minerals; Industry, Trade, Shipping as well as Infrastructure which contains news on
infrastructure projects proposed or underway and on railways; Stabilisation, the Exchange Rate, the Money Supply and the
National Bank which was the central bank in Greece until 12th May 1928; and finally, the Banks where references to banks
other than the National Bank are included.
(5) Information on macroeconomic conditions can be separated into two groups: news on the real economy (Economic
Conditions, Primary Sector, Industry, Trade, Shipping and Infrastructure) and monetary and financial information (Stabilisation,
the Exchange Rate, the Money Supply, the National Bank and the Banks).
(6) The Greek Extracts include press cuttings with information for British investors on entrepreneurial opportunities in Greece.
(7) Miscellaneous primarily contains information on foreign direct investment in Greece.

It is apparent that the Council pedantically collected information on
Greek government debt as it appeared in the British press. References to
public debt account for between one third and over half of the total
references to Greece in a year. If information on public debt in the Greek
Extracts is thematically disaggregated, as in Table A12, news on the service
of the debt predominates. Special consideration was also paid to gathering
announcements in the press that described efforts of the Greek government
to raise fresh capital both on the international financial markets and in
Athens. In retrospect, reports in the press on fresh borrowing and its terms
might have been instigated frequently by Greek officials in an attempt to
influence market expectations. Ex post, having the benefit of archival
research, reports on new loans during periods that the Greek government
faced difficulties in borrowing or a financial embargo as the London market
‘was not the free market of the pre-war days’43 illustrate the method and the
terms on which Greek officials wished to borrow.44
The information presented in Table 4 demonstrates that public finance
comes after government debt in terms of importance. References to the
finance of the Greek government vary from 14 percent to nearly 29 percent
of the total theme references of a year. In the 1920s, it was customary to
report the budget presentations of the Greek Minister of Finance in the
British press. In these reports, the tenor was positive and expenditure
typically met revenues. Public borrowing was added up with ordinary
revenues to present a budget in equilibrium, a practice that was not
overlooked by newspaper correspondents.45
43 Atkin, "Official Regulation," p. 326. 44 See for example Greek Extracts for 1921 and Greek Extracts, F. News, 8th April 1927. 45 See The Ecomomist, 2nd September 1922.
27


Citations on politics vary from no reference at all in 1919, a year of
political stability, to twelve and a half percent of total citations in 1924 which
was a year of constitutional change as the country became a republic, and
had only short-lived governments. The collection of press cuttings in the
Greek Extracts on the political situation is eclectic and hardly paints the
picture of political crisis and bitter polarisation that characterised these
times. Having said that however, one can find press cuttings on all major
political changes or general elections of the period.
War and refugee problems have serious implications for fiscal
equilibrium. It is therefore surprising that both these issues, as Table 4
demonstrates, are hardly covered by the press cuttings collected in the
Extracts. Cuttings on the Greek presence in Smyrna or on the advance of
the Greek army in Asia Minor and ultimate defeat are scarce in the Greek
Extracts. By contrast, events in Asia Minor and the debacle were more than
adequately reported in the British Press.46 In addition, despite the refugee
problem in Greece being ‘more acute ... than in any other country’47 and at
the time attracting wide-spread attention, press cuttings on refugees
included in the Greek Extracts are limited and mainly related to the Refugee
Loan of 1924.48
News on the macroeconomic health of the country can be divided into
two parts: news on the three sectors of the economy and monetary and
financial information. In the 1920s, a period of high inflation in Greece, news
on monetary conditions dominate. Information on fluctuations of the
drachma is provided as well as articles that discuss the root of that problem.
Economic and policy changes are reported and there is plenty of information
46 See Palmer's Index to the Times Newspaper (1922).
47 Cited in Pentzopoulos, The Balkan Exchange of Minorities, p. 77-78. 48 By contrast the Economist reported regularly on the refugee question in Greece.
28


on the central banking reforms that led to the establishment of a fully fledged
central bank. In total, news on the three sectors of the economy together
with monetary and financial news fluctuates between six and a half percent
of the total observations in 1918 and over thirty percent in 1925.49 Both in
qualitative and quantitative terms, news on macroeconomic developments
gathered in the Greek Extracts plays a more central role than information on
the political situation, supporting the assertion that ‘economics, not politics,
were a key factor in allocating [...] exports of capital’.50
A secondary objective of the Council of the Corporation of Foreign
Bondholders was to provide information on ‘the economic and financial
condition’ of states that were at the centre of their interest.51 They never
attempted to develop a system of formal rating.52 However, they collected
ample information to enable investors to assess sovereign risk. The cuttings
from the British press collected in the Greek Extracts indicate that news on
public debt took precedence over any other issue and public finance
followed. News on macroeconomic conditions was also a vital component of
the information gathered in the Greek Extracts. The question arises
therefore as to whether this kind of news, collected in the Greek Extracts by
the Council to encapsulate events, really influenced investors’ expectations
and determined prices of Greek government bonds on the London market as
indicated by the statistical analysis of the time series employed in the
following section of this paper.
49 In 1918, all references are on the economy and trade opportunities in Greece for British merchants. In 1925, the emphasis is shifted to the exchange rate and to news on the money supply; nearly 24 per cent of the total references are on monetary and financial issues whilst only eight per cent refer to the economy. 50 Flandreau, "Caveat Emptor," p.31. 51 Corporation of Foreign Bondholders, Annual Report. 52 See Flandreau, "Caveat Emptor," for a 19th century attempt to provide formal ratings to monitor sovereign risk and Moody, Moody's Manual for creation of sovereign ratings in the 1920s.

5. A structural approach to detecting turning points
5.1. Method
Willard, Guinnane, and Rosen53 use rigorous statistical analysis to
detect unusual points in historic data. Their method, based on the work of
Banerjee, Lumsdaine, and Stock,54 involves fitting autoregressive models in
a moving window and identifying breaks sequentially. Wells and Wills55
apply this idea using a vector autoregressive model. The moving window
approach is appropriate for long series with an autoregressive structure.
However, the detection process involves somewhat arbitrary choices
including the order of auto-regression and the width of the window. No
consideration is given to single outlying points which may exert strong
influence on the parameter estimates. Repeated model fitting is not the
most efficient method particularly for shorter series or when observations are
made with lower frequency.
Figures 1, 2 and 3 are time series plots of the data under
consideration. The salient features include levels which change over time
and seasonal behaviour. A basic structural model is appropriate for these
data.56 The model is based on the classical decomposition, for t=1,...,n,
, { } ~ NID(0, 2 ), (1)
yt = μt +γt + εt εt σε

We use the basic structural model (1) as our null. Our aim is to detect
and categorise departures from the null model. Two common types of
unusual behaviour in economic data are measurement outliers and level
shifts. A measurement outlier, often referred to as just an outlier, is a single
point which does not fit in with the rest of the data. A permanent change in
the underlying level of the series is known as a level shift. Once we have
detected an outlier or level shift, we account for them by including additive
interventions in our model. Interventions are dummy explanatory
variables, , which have simple forms. For an outlier at time ,

The usual regression t-statistics based on the estimated magnitude
associated with a fitted intervention are used to determine significance.
Our diagnostic statistics are based on moving an intervention along
the series. For example, in order to detect an outlier we could sequentially
fit the intervention (2) and evaluate the corresponding t-statistics. A large t
statistic at point i is indicative of an outlier at that point. Regression t-statistic
based diagnostics can be evaluated very efficiently using the output of the
Kalman filter and associated smoother. This approach avoids repeated
fitting of intervention variables. Details are omitted here but can be found in
De Jong and Penzer.57
For sample sizes over 30, the distributions of the diagnostics under
the null are closely approximated by standard normals. However, we are
simultaneously testing n points, so the usual 5% critical values of -1.96 and
+1.96 will give a test with a much larger size. Critical values which yield a
better size of test are generated easily using the first Bonferroni inequality.
Suppose X1, . . . , Xn are random variables with identical marginal
distributions, and X(n) is the last order statistic, that is, the largest value.
Using the Bonferroni inequality, we can show that if k is a point such that
P(X1 > k) = α/n then P( X(n) > k) : α. Hence, using k as a critical value for
the maximum gives a test with significance level less than or equal to α.
57 De Jong and Penzer, "Diagnosing Shocks in Time Series."
32


Table 5 gives values of k such that P(X1 < k) = 1 - α/n. Thus, critical values
of -3.5 and +3.5 will give an approximate 5% test in a sample of size 100.
These results are confirmed by simulation experiments.58 For samples of
the order of 102, we consider points with t-statistics greater than 3.2 in
absolute value which corresponds to a significance level of approximately
10%. This is an arbitrary choice which can be adjusted to suit the situation.
Practical experience indicates that 10% provides a good compromise
between size and power in detecting historical breaks.

The series analysed in this paper contain several unusual points. We
use a stepwise approach to detection in which significant interventions are
introduced one by one. The process is divided into forwards and backwards
steps.
58 Penzer, "Critical Values ."
33


a) Forward steps
(i) Fit the current model and generate diagnostics statistics for outliers
and level shifts for every point in the series.
(ii) Locate the single largest value from both sets of diagnostic
statistics.
(iii) If this is significant, update our current model by including an
appropriate intervention. For example, if the largest statistic was in the
outlier diagnostic series we would add intervention (2) to our current model.
b) Backward steps
(i) Fit the current model and evaluate the t-statistics associated with
the intervention which are in the model.
(ii) If any interventions have ceased to be significant, update current
model by removing them and go to step i.
The procedure is initialised with the null model and repeated until
there are no more significant outliers or level shifts left unaccounted for. The
output is a final fitted model and a set of points at which unusual events may
have occurred, categorised as outliers or level shifts. Computational results
were produced with code written in Ox59 using Ssfpack60 and with the
package STAMP61.

diagnostic statistics are given in Table 6. For each of the series most of the
variability is in the level component. The slope components in these models
are not significant so the trend is reduced to a random walk. The residual
based diagnostic checks are the Bowman-Shenton test for normality, the
Durbin-Watson test for serial correlation and the portmanteau Box-Ljung Q
statistic based on the first 11 sample residual autocorrelations. Approximate
critical values for these statistics in test with significance level 5% are given
in brackets. It is clear that there is no evidence of serial correlation in the
residuals. However, for each series, there is some indication that the
residuals are not normally distributed. This non-normality may be attributed
to the presence of unusual points.

Figure 4 is a series of daily observations from Wednesday 29th April
1925 to Tuesday 31st December 1929 (1180 observations). The key feature
of this series is regularly spaced, biannual drops in the level of the series.
These can be seen clearly from Figure 5, the plot of first difference of the
series. Level shift intervention variables are included at approximate six
month intervals starting on 4th May 1925. The series is of order 103 so using
critical values –3.8 and +3.8 gives an approximate 10% significance level to
test for the presence of unusual points. Several outliers and levels shifts are
detected in the series and presented in Table 10. However, the key feature
of these data, once the regular downward shifts in level have been
accounted for, is the non-normality of the residuals. A QQ-plot, as in Figure
A9, indicates that the residuals are heavy-tailed. A distribution with higher
kurtosis than the normal, such as a t-distribution with low degrees of
freedom, may be suitable for the error process of the series. This is an
interesting direction for future work.

Notes:
(1) In April 1920, a public loan denominated in drachmas, the 5% Lottery Loan, was floated in Athens with great difficulty in spite of concessions from the government to encourage subscription. See also the text. (2) The I.F.C. announced payment of the interest and sinking fund for the loans under its jurisdiction beyond the minimum rates fixed by the ‘Law of Control’. See also the text. (3) In March 1927, a serious dispute arose between the Greek government and the I.F.C. as to the method of calculating the plus values payable in 1927. The Greek government demanded arbitration. Pending the outcome, coupons maturing on the loans issued prior to 1893 were paid at their minimum rate. In November 1928, a few days after the decision of the umpire was made known, the I.F.C. announced the additional interest rates due on these loans. (See Greek Extracts, F. Times, 28th November 1928.) The Monopoly Loan is one such and its market price jumps from 53.50 per cent of its face value in October 1928 to 60.50 per cent at the end of November of that year. Source: See the text.
The three time series shown by Figures 1, 2, and 3, present a
consistent picture of the period in question. The statistical analysis,
however, reveals that there is some discrepancy in the behaviour of the
three loans. It is evident from the results presented in Table 9 that the 1914
Loan distinguishes itself from the Monopoly and Bonds loans. This
difference in the behaviour of the three loans could be a ‘guide to the
38


labyrinth’62 of the Greek public debt and at the same time could show the
complexity of the way that markets operate. It is consistent with the efficient
market hypothesis, in particular with the weaker form of this hypothesis.63
This feature does not manifest itself if only one historical time series, as has
been the case in the literature, is employed or an index of the values of
government bonds is used to examine market response to news.64
The discrepancy in the behaviour could be explained by different
attributes of each loan that are not always readily apparent. For example,
the seniority sequence in the service of these three loans was dissimilar; the
Monopoly and the 1914 loans were under the direct control of the I.F.C. but
the Bonds Loan, although secured by public revenues assigned to the
Commission, was not placed under their direct control. Knowing the identity
of the ultimate buyers and sellers of Greek government bonds on the
London Stock Exchange could also shed light on why there is a discrepancy
in the behaviour of the three time series.
The statistical analysis indicates that the two organised interventions
of the National Bank to manipulate market prices of the Greek government
bonds in London described in Table 2, did not produce any statistically
significant market reaction that would indicate a change in market
expectations. As Tables 9 and 10 show, no positive level shifts and outliers
occurred during the attempts of the National Bank to improve the market
price of Greek sovereign debt and in this way to influence the terms of
borrowing of the Greek government on the London market, as the organised
62 The Economist, 27th January, 1923. 63 See Fama, "Efficient Capital Markets." 64 In Brown Jr and Burdekin, "German Debt Traded in London" two loans are examined, the 7% Dawes Loan of 1924 and the 5.5% Young Loan of 1930, and the statistical analysis shows some difference in their behaviour. See p.657 for their comments on this. For the use of a weighted index of market values of government bonds see Frey and Kucher, "History as Reflected in Capital Markets."
39


interventions coincide with the two most important borrowing operations of
the Greek government in the 1920s.
In the text that follows, the level shifts and the outliers detected by the
statistical analysis are related to historical events that shaped investors’
behaviour on the London Stock Exchange.
6.1. Expectations and Reality: Political Rhetoric versus Market Forces
The jubilation stirred up by the Great War victory soon faded away.
During the summer of 1919, the first doubts about the presence of Greek
troops in Asia Minor were openly expressed, particularly by France.65 In a
report, prepared for the Overseas Trade Department in Britain on the
economic situation in Greece that summer, reservations were expressed
about the capacity of Greece to carry out her financial obligations even if
taxation was increased. This report was never circulated because it
provoked a strong negative reaction from the Greek government. The three
loans under scrutiny here, present a falling tendency after June 1919, a
month after Greek troops disembarked in Smyrna, and by the end of 1919
there had ‘been considerable reduction in the quotations of Greek loans on
the London market’.66 Two of the three time series analysed in this paper,
those for the Bonds Loan and the Monopoly Loan show a sudden level shift
downwards in December 1919, demonstrating a change in that month in the
investors’ perception of the fiscal health of the country. This drop indicates
that as early as December 1919 investors considered it possible that the
Greek government would not be able to service its debt and at the same time
to pursue its territorial aspirations in Asia Minor.
65 History of the Greek Nation, p.152.
66 Greek Extracts, D. Telegraph, 1st January 1920.
40


Geopolitical changes in the area generated ‘uncertainty as to the
measure in which the [Greek] national claims [would] be satisfied’.67 This
uncertainty coupled with the economic and military capacity of Greece to
sustain its presence in Asia Minor stimulated the sustained downward trend in
the market price of Greek government bonds on the London Stock Exchange.
News, however, in December 1919 of the fiscal situation of the Greek
Government must have caused the sudden negative effect on the value of the
Monopoly and Bonds Loans, at the end of that month. The uncomfortable
‘discrepancy between revenue and expenditure’68 that was disclosed, coupled
with the presence of Greek troops in Smyrna encouraged investors to sell
Greek government bonds and perhaps restructure their portfolios, taking
advantage of the opportunities that the London market offered at the end of
1919. During the last two months of 1919 the London market enjoyed a
short-lived boom in overseas issues as regulations introduced by the
Treasury to control the City were repealed in November 1919 and the Bank
of England had not yet come into the picture to regulate intermittently the
flotation of new overseas loans.69
Analysis of the 1914 Loan distinguishes it from the Monopoly and the
Bonds loans. The 1914 Loan presents a sudden downward level shift for the
first time in April 1920. In April 1920, a public loan denominated in drachmas,
the 5% Lottery Loan, was floated in Athens with great difficulty, in spite of
concessions from the government to encourage subscription.70 This was the
last attempt of the Greek government to issue a public loan on the Athens
market before the stabilisation of the drachma. This downward level shift also

coincides with the end of the Allied conference which took place at San
Remo, in Italy. The outcome of this conference catalysed the course of the
war in Asia Minor.71 This time series of the 1914 Loan also displays a
downward level shift in December 1920. This downward level shift coincides
with developments in Greece, described in Section 2, that the political
historiography views as crucial to the course of history on the Asia Minor front
and that the economic history literature sees as central in explaining the slide
of the drachma.
The 1914 Loan level shift in December 1920 reflects beliefs in the
conventional historiography. The question that is raised is why the decrease in
the market value of the 1914 Loan mirrors history in its conventional form.
Light could be shed on this question if it was known who were the ultimate
buyers and sellers of Greek government bonds on the London Stock
Exchange during the period in question. Knowledge of the volume of
transactions that took place would also be helpful. This is evidence that it
may not be possible to find for the period in question. Research, however,
shows that at the time one of the major bondholders of the 1914 Loan was the
National Bank of Greece.72 In addition, the amount of this loan traded on the
London Stock Exchange in 1920 as quoted by the Investor’s Monthly Manual
is small.73 Hence, it can be safely assumed that the downward level shift in
the market prices of the 1914 Loan in December 1920 and possibly also in
April of that year, mirror the expectations of a specific group of investors in
Greek government bonds.

6.2. The Debacle
Figures 1, 2 and 3 demonstrate in a graphic way why Greek
governments faced great difficulties in the financial markets in raising capital
to finance the Asia Minor campaign, beyond the politics and embargoes
referred to in the literature. After 1919, Greek government bonds sustained
their downward trend and consequently the risk premium on Greek
government debt rocketed, reflecting the decreased credibility of the Greek
government as a borrower on the London market. The Economist repeatedly
reassured holders of Greek government bonds that although the situation in
Athens, both financially and politically, was critical there was no reason to
suppose that this would affect the service of public debt.74 Market signals
were also encouraging to investors: in 1920, the I.F.C. paid holders of
Monopoly Loan bonds their full contractual interest rate, as Table A11 shows,
for the first time since the introduction of the ‘Law of Control’.
The Asia Minor campaign ended disastrously for Greece in the late
summer of 1922. The effect of this outcome along with the political changes
in the country that followed the military defeat are illustrated dramatically as
the market value of the bonds in each of the three time series presented
here plummets. The statistical analysis reveals that both the Monopoly and
the Bonds Loan present a level shift downwards in November 1922 while the
1914 Loan shows a negative outlier in that same month.
The Revolutionary Committee, as it is known, that is the military
faction of officers supporting the Liberal Party that assumed power after the
debacle, immediately searched for an answer to what had caused the
military defeat of the Greek army in Asia Minor. They responded to the
debacle in the conventional way by seeking out those ‘responsible’ for the
74 The Economist, 22nd October 1921, 4th March 1922 and 5th August 1922.

tragedy. The trial of five prominent politicians close to King Constantine 
three of whom had served as prime ministers and two as ministers- and the
last Commander-in-Chief of the Greek Army in Asia Minor began on 31st
October (Julian)/13th November (Gregorian). The charge was ‘high
treason’. The trial ended on 14th (Julian)/27th November (Gregorian) and
the court announced its decision in the early hours of the following morning.
In the case of each defendant the sentence was death and the executions
took place a few hours later at 11.27 a.m. on 15th (Julian)/28th November
(Gregorian) 1922.75 There was an international outcry at this development
and Britain immediately recalled her ambassador from Athens.76
Clearly, developments on the Asia Minor front influenced decisively
the value of the country’s sovereign bonds traded in London. Political
developments in the country and the determination that the Revolutionary
Committee showed in handling domestic issues had a strong impact on
investors’ confidence that the Greek government would continue to honour
its debt obligations. The value on the London market of the Bonds Loan, for
example, fell to 17.50 per cent of face value indicating a dramatic decrease
in public confidence in the Greek government. This market value of the
Bonds Loan amounted to a sovereign risk of nearly 19 per cent, a country
risk indicating a government approaching bankruptcy.77

76 On 29th November 1922, the day after the execution of the Six, the leading article of the Times of London entitled ‘Greece in Peril’ was devoted to the latest events in Athens. The act of execution was strongly condemned and deemed as damaging the interests of Greece abroad ‘at a moment when [the] country more than ever need[ed] support and aid’. See the Times, 29th November 1922; and Greek Extracts, Times, 29th November 1922. 77 Country risk is measured by a loans spread in London relative to the British consuls at the end of November 1922. The country risk that the Bonds and the 1914 loans indicate is respectively 18.51 and 15.26 per cent. As has been explained, the coupon rate paid to the Monopoly Loan bondholders fluctuated within a band, from year to year, depending on the
44


6.3. Credibility, Commitment and Institutions: Market Reception
Figures 1, 2 and 3 clearly show that late in 1922 market actors
believed that the Greek government was approaching default. By contrast,
none of the Greek governments of the period, despite the difficulties they
encountered in financing public expenditure, considered default an option.
The humiliation of the military defeat in 1922 combined with the transaction
costs and the embarrassment of the 1893 default that still loomed large in
politicians’ minds in Athens, as well as the belief that foreign aid would be
forthcoming, led governments to opt for controversial measures to cover
expenditure rather than ceasing to honour their interest bearing
obligations.78 Even the Revolutionary Committee ‘though they had not
flinched at taking the lives of six of Greece’s most prominent citizens,
astonished the world by the subsequent moderation ... of their rule’79 and did
not behave differently.
The three monthly time series analysed present a swift reversal in
their trend after the November 1922 events in Athens and subsequently as
Table 9 shows, exhibit a significant statistical change in March 1923. The
Monopoly and the 1914 loans show an upward level shift in March 1923
while the Bonds Loan takes precedence and presents a positive level shift in
February 1923 followed by a positive outlier in March. It is difficult to explain
why the Bonds Loan has a lead over the other two loans and is the first to
show a positive change in the investors expectations about future service of
Greek government debt.
surplus revenue of the I.F.C. Using therefore, the coupon rate paid to Monopoly Loan bondholders in 1922, this loan points to a country risk of 10.76 per cent. There is again a discrepancy between the three loans; the three loans point to a sovereign risk with a difference between the lowest and the highest of nearly eight basis points. 78 The most controversial measure adopted was the Forced Loan of April 1922. The experiment was repeated in 1926. 79 Morgenthau, I Was Sent to Athens, p. 106.
45


Good news on the service of public debt caused these optimistic
structural shifts.80 After the Asia Minor debacle, the customary
announcements on the service of Greek public debt appeared in the British
press on time and debt service obligations were met on schedule. The
shaky fiscal position of the Greek government and a rapidly falling drachma,
however, jeopardised the prospects of the future incomes of bondholders, in
particular the income of holders of old Gold Loans whose coupon rate
fluctuated within a band depending on the surplus revenue of the I.F.C.81 In
March 1923, the I.F.C. announced the payment of interest and sinking fund
beyond the minimum rates fixed by the ‘Law of Control’ on the loans under
their jurisdiction.82 Yields were higher than anticipated because of a
concession by the Greek government to the I.F.C. This was a deliberate act
on the part of the Revolutionary Committee to change market expectations
to their advantage during a period when they desperately sought capital
abroad. It is therefore possible that news on the service of public debt
produced favourable impressions on the market and changed investors’
assessments regarding future debt service of the Greek government.
80 In an earlier version of this paper -see Christodoulaki and Penzer, "News from London"it was argued that these positive level shifts were due to the fact that the Greek government had approached the Council of the League of Nations hoping to gain their support to float a loan for the settlement of refugees. Research in the press of the period suggests that talks with the League were kept confidential and were not disclosed to the press. As an article in the Economist (16th June 1923) states, news that the Greek government was negotiating with the Financial Committee for a League loan, was first announced to the public early in May 1923. It was however, well known to investors at the time that the Greek government had been searching for sources of capital without success, at European capital markets. They also sought capital for public works. See Greek Extracts: Financial News, 26th February 1923; Financial News, 22nd March 1923; and Financial News, 24th March 1923. 81 25th August, 1922 the drachma stood at 142 drachmas to the pound sterling; 2nd March, 1923 it was 440 drachmas to the pound sterling in London. (Source: the Economist.)

The extended period of restoration of the institutions of the country,
both political and economic, is delineated by the three time series of monthly
data analysed here. They all present a steady recovery. The statistical
analysis of the three monthly time series however, does not reveal any
structural changes between March 1923 and the implementation of a League
of Nations stabilisation plan in 1928. (The exception being again the 1914
Loan which shows a positive outlier in January 1924, when Venizelos
returned to Athens and for a short period became the Premier, and an upward
level shift in April of that same year when the country was declared a
republic.) It is apparent, however, in Figures 1, 2 and 3 that eventual
stabilisation and the concomitant institutional reforms had already been
factored into the market value of the bonds. At the end of 1928 the market
value of the bonds of the Monopoly Loan in London was 60 per cent of their
par value, the Bonds Loan 62 per cent and the 1914 Loan 77 per cent.83
Given that the statistical analysis of the three monthly time series
shows that central banking reforms and the de jure embrace of the Gold
Exchange Standard in Greece in 1928 did not prompt any statistically
significant market response, daily prices of Greek government debt on the
London Stock Exchange have been employed to provide further insight into
the way that investors responded to news of currency stabilisation and
institutional changes in Greece in the late 1920s. (The daily observations of
83 A comparison of the risk premium of the three loans at the end of December 1928 with their risk premium in November 1922 conveys the improvement of the credibility of the Greek government on the London market. In December 1928, the sovereign risk of the Monopoly Loan –the coupon rate paid in 1928 is used to estimate the country risk of this loan- is 2.08 per cent, the Bonds Loan 2.01 per cent and the 1914 Loan 2.05 per cent. It is noteworthy that by 1928, there is convergence in the risk premium that the three loans indicate. By contrast to 1922, this time the lowest country risk is indicated by the Bonds Loan.

Notes:
(1) The Press reports of this month painted an optimistic picture of the economic situation in Greece. It was also reported that a new Refugee Loan under the auspices of the League was imminent. (See Greek Extracts, June 1926.) (2) News of this coup d’etat appeared in the London Press on 23rd August 1926. (See Greek Extracts, F. Times, 23rd August 1926.) (3) It is not easy to explain the timing of this positive structural change. At the end of January 1927 the Committee of Greek Experts, appointed by the coalition government to suggest measures for fiscal and monetary stability, submitted its report. News on the measures suggested and steps to be taken by the government to overcome obstacles to stabilisation dominated the British press. (See Greek Extracts, 25th January to 15th February.) It would perhaps be far fetched to argue that this positive structural change shows the confidence of the London market in the coalition government in achieving fiscal and monetary stability. (4) The Monopoly Loan examined in this paper belonged to this category of Greek foreign loans. The Monopoly, the Bonds and the 1914 loans also presented a drop at the end of March 1927 after having shown a significant recovery in January 1927. The statistical analysis, however, of these monthly time series does not reveal any structural change. (5) A mixture of fiscal and public debt news might have produced this positive outlier. An official announcement from the Minister of Finance stated that the financial year that had just expired ended in surplus. In fact, it had resulted in deficit although small, both in terms of its size and as a percentage of GDP. (6) It became known late in October 1929 that an agreement signed between the Greek Government and Seligmans for the flotation of a loan for public works had been cancelled by mutual consent. The official reason given for the termination of this agreement was that the I.F.C. had refused to assume responsibility of the service of this loan. Service by the I.F.C. was a condition in the contract for the opening of the credit and the flotation of the loan. The Refugee Loan market price started dropping after this statement. News of an intended increase in the money supply might have influenced a further decrease in the market price of Refugee Loan bonds. The reasons used by the Government to justify this proposed increase in the currency in circulation were reminiscent of the arguments used in the 1920s for employing the printing press. This intervention by the Government violated the independence of the Bank of Greece, the newly established central bank, and the Geneva Protocol. In the end it was announced, the Bank of Greece also making a statement, that the printing press would not be used as a monetary policy tool. The Central Bank would be in charge of the situation and banks were encouraged to avail themselves of the rediscounting facility of the Bank of Greece. It is interesting to note that the Monopoly, the Bonds and the 1914 loans all present a drop at the end of October and then an increase at the end of November 1929.

Table 10 presents details of the statistical analysis of the Refugee Loan
and suggests events that might be responsible for the statistical deviations
detected. The key feature of this daily time series is regular spaced, biannual
49


drops in the level of the series that occur on the first day of trading after each
of the First of May and First of November.84 Figure 5, which is the plot of the
first difference of the time series, captures graphically these biannual drops
whilst Figure 4 shows the market price of the Refugee Loan as a percentage
of par. The biannual drops in the level of this series of the Refugee Loan
coincide with coupon payments and redemption of bonds drawn by lot. After
each 1st May and 1st November coupons were paid off at Hambros Bank in
London. Simultaneously, bonds drawn by lot for redemption could be
redeemed.85
84 The London Stock Exchange was closed on Saturdays and on the First of May and First of November during the period in question. See City Diary and Almanack. See for the origin of these holidays on 1st May and 1st November Duguid, The Story of the Stock Exchange, p.83.
85 Draws of bonds of the Refugee Loan took place in Athens twice a year in March and September, commencing in September 1925. The numbers drawn were announced in the press including British newspapers and repayment at par could take place correspondingly after 1st May and 1st November each year.

In addition to these regularly-spaced drops, several level shifts and
outliers are also detectable, as Table 10 demonstrates. Column three of
Table 10 suggests events that might have triggered the level shifts and the
outliers exposed by the statistical analysis. News on the service of public
debt, fiscal and money supply announcements, as well as unexpected
political changes produced the non-regularly-spaced level shifts and the
outliers for the Refugee Loan. These events that elicited an immediate
market response are also reflected in the information about Greece collected
from British newspapers by the Council of the Corporation of Foreign
Bondholders and summarised in Table 4. By contrast, no level shifts or
outliers correspond to events that the literature regards as playing a
significant role in achieving monetary stability; that is the elections of
52


November 1926, settlement of war debts with Great Britain86, resort to the
League of Nations in 1927, and finally the flotation of the Stabilisation Loan
in 1928. Crucially, there is no statistically significant change to coincide with
the establishment of the central bank and de jure stabilisation of the
drachma.
Central banking reforms and the adoption of the Gold Exchange
Standard in Greece in 1928 could hardly surprise investors.87 Both events
were publicised in the press. In addition, there was generally a lengthy time
span between the first, and possibly informal, announcement and the
promulgation of the reforms. Statements about the intention of the Greek
government to stabilise the drachma appeared in the British press as early
as July 192588 and then, as Table 4 illustrates, it was frequently in the news
until de jure stabilisation. The formal announcement and the timing of de
jure stabilisation of the drachma close to its market value was therefore
anticipated by market participants. The drachma had been de facto
stabilised for a whole year before May 1928 and monetary authorities as well
86 Pepelasis overemphasises the role of the settlement of the War Debts with Britain in opening the road to stabilisation. See Pepelasis Minoglou, "The Greek State and the International Financial Community". 87 Sussman and Yafeh (2000) argue that by contrast to innovations in Japan such as the establishment of the Bank of Japan in 1882 that failed to elicit an immediate market response, the adoption of the Gold Standard in 1897 did significantly reduce the perceived risk associated with Japanese bonds traded on the London Stock Exchange. They conclude that in sharp contrast to the Gold Standard which was a well-understood economic rule, institutional changes were difficult to evaluate at the time and therefore had no effect on the London market’s perception of Japanese debt. The few reports in the press on these institutional changes in Japan did not help to win investors’ appreciation as credible signs of development or of the government's ability to repay its foreign debt. The swift reduction, however, in the risk premium at the time of the introduction of the Gold Standard in Japan, so vividly illustrated in Figure 1 of their article and detected by the statistical analysis, could be attributed to debt restructuring that took place to facilitate the financial and monetary reform endorsed by the Coinage Law of 1897. See for similar comments Flandreau and Zumer, "Sovereign Risk and Reputation," pp. 13-14. 88 Greek Extracts, F. News, 6th July 1925. See also the Economist, 10th January 1925.

as government officials involved, advocated at every opportunity, legal
stabilisation without ‘revalorisation’.89
News about possible central banking reforms in Greece appeared in
the British press on the same day that the Greek representatives in Geneva
officially asked the Council to authorise a stabilisation loan for Greece. The
Financial News of 15th June reported that the National Bank, under the
League’s scheme, ‘would be transformed into an issue bank and would
engage a foreign advisor’.90 Some central banking reforms would in any
event, have been anticipated by the markets as they were an integral part of
all the League-sponsored reconstruction schemes that had preceded the
Greek stabilisation plan. Three weeks later, the Economist published a long
article on the negotiations between Greek officials and the Financial
Committee of the League. It was reported that a prerequisite for the flotation
of a League sponsored loan was that the Greek parliament authorised ‘the
gradual conversion of the National Bank of Greece into a central bank of
issue of modern type’.91 By that time, however, not only the manner of
central banking reform in Greece had been agreed upon, but the statutes of
the New Bank of Issue had been drafted.92 Discussions between the Greek
side and the representatives of the League were difficult as there was a

fundamental disagreement over the way that each side envisaged central
banking reforms taking place in the country.93
The architects of the reform at first withheld and then influenced the
release of news of the establishment of the Bank of Greece. On 17th July,
the day that the Ministers of Finance and Foreign Affairs returned to Athens,
the first reference to the creation of a New Central Bank appeared in the
Greek press as an option under consideration.94 The first public
announcements by the Minister of Finance to the press stated clearly that
two plans were being considered: the government was thinking either of
transforming ‘the National Bank into a pure bank of issue by transferring all
its other functions to another bank’ or of forming ‘a new independent bank of
issue’.95 By early August 1927, details of the sweeping reforms had been
made publicly known as had been the opposition of the leader of the populist
party to the arrangements provided by the Geneva Protocol. As a result, the
populist party withdrew from the coalition government objecting to the
establishment of a new fully-fledged central bank. Political opposition did not
endanger the reforms. A reshuffled government brought the stabilisation plan
to parliament, which ratified it the following December, the Populist Party
being absent. Previously, the Council of the League had approved the
scheme in its September session.
The London press reported developments in Athens as they unfolded.96
A statistically significant and not necessarily positive, market reaction might

be expected to occur at the time at which news of the imminent establishment
of the Bank of Greece was announced. In fact, the statistical analysis of both
the daily observations of the Refugee Loan and the monthly data of the three
loans employed, show that financial market actors’ behaviour was not
dramatically influenced by the news. However, market prices of Greek
government bonds, as Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 show, did respond to available
information. Bond prices drifted gradually upwards as news of institutional
changes in Athens reached the market. Between the end of December 1926
and May 1928 the market price of the Monopoly and the 1914 loans rose by
more than 17 and 19 per cent respectively, while that of the Bonds Loan
recovered by nearly 26 per cent.
Political authorities expected that institutional developments that
ended with the establishment of a central bank and the adoption of the Gold
Exchange Standard would facilitate an influx of foreign capital essential for
economic growth. The impact, however, that these institutional reforms
could have, at least in the short-run, on the cost and of course the volume of
Greek borrowing ‘should reflect external circumstances as well’.97 By May
1928 the Greek government was over-borrowed and the international
economy was about to enter the most severe depression that has ever been
experienced. A few months after the adoption of the Gold Exchange
Standard by Greece, in December 1928, a loan for public works with a
nominal value of four million pounds was issued on the London market, on
similar terms to the Stabilisation Loan. Only one third of this loan was
covered. A month later, in January 1929, the Greek government signed an
agreement with Seligman & Co for a loan with a nominal value of up to 54

million dollars.98 The agreement provided for the flotation of a loan on terms
similar to the Stabilisation Loan. The I.F.C. would assume responsibility for
its service and Seligman would take any part of the loan that remained
uncovered. On 30th October 1929, the Evening Standard announced the
cancellation of this loan.99 The official reason for the termination of this
agreement was that the I.F.C. had refused to assume responsibility for the
service of this loan.100 The timing of the termination of the agreement is
more revealing than the official announcement.
7. Conclusion
This work contributes to the literature that focuses on the interaction of
historical events including institutional changes and capital markets. The
evidence presented is for the impact of political and economic developments
on asset price determination and consequently on the cost of sovereign
borrowing. Statistical analysis has been applied to evaluate capital market
responses to historical events and in this way to offer new insights into
understanding the difficulties that Greece faced in raising capital from the
financial markets during the period in question.
The three time series of monthly data examined, provide a coherent
picture of the period under examination despite discrepancies in the results
obtained from the statistical analysis. Geopolitical events in the area
98 The nominal value of this loan in sterling was approximately eleven million, close to that of the Refugee Loan of 1924. This means that the Seligman Loan was potentially a bigger lending operation than the Stabilisation Loan. 99 Greek Extracts, 30th October 1929. 100 Greek Extracts: M. Post, 2nd November 1929; F.

impacted on the value of Greek sovereign debt on the London market. The
value of Greek bonds traded on the London Stock Exchange decreased
dramatically in response to developments in Asia Minor. News related to the
military campaign in Asia Minor was a proxy for fiscal news, an important
determinant of the capacity of the country to sustain the service of its
sovereign debt. A level shift downwards of the 1914 Loan in December
1920, coincides with domestic political events that conventional
historiography regards as having a decisive effect on the course of history.
The Asia Minor debacle as well as domestic political developments
exerted a strong negative effect on the market price of Greek sovereign
debt. The aftermath of the military defeat created uncertainty among holders
of Greek government debt over future payments. By contrast, punctual and
encouraging announcements regarding the service of public debt altered
market perceptions of the capacity of the Greek government to honour its
debt obligations.
It is a genuine challenge, using advanced statistical analysis, to
attempt to understand what caused changes in investors’ expectations over
future payments of sovereign debt, in particular during such a complex
historical period. The analysis both of the monthly data on Greek
government loans examined and the Refugee Loan daily observations,
clearly shows that investors acted upon news on public debt and fiscal
performance. Unexpected political events that created uncertainty among
the bondholders over future service of public debt exerted a negative impact
on the price of Greek loans on the London market. The analysis of the daily
observations also indicates that news of the money supply played an
important role in influencing market prices of the country’s sovereign debt
traded on the London Stock Exchange.
58


Institutional innovations such as the adoption of the Gold Exchange
Standard and the establishment of a central bank did not produce any
quantitative market reaction. This is confirmed by the statistical analysis of
the daily observations of the Refugee Loan that cover the long period
towards stabilisation. The statistical analysis shows that the introduction of
the Gold Exchange Standard and central banking reforms did not produce
any immediate market response. Research into the press shows that
market participants were able to be very well informed about the nature and
the implementation of the institutional reforms. Formal announcements on
institutional changes such as the adoption of the Gold Exchange Standard
and the establishment of a central bank could hardly contain new
information. These reforms generally take a long time to be promulgated
and need to be ratified by parliament. Market actors observed and
evaluated every step taken towards stabilisation carefully. As a result,
stabilisation and the concomitant institutional reforms were factored into the
market price of Greek sovereign debt traded in London.
If the results of the statistical analysis are juxtaposed with the
information on Greece collected from British newspapers on behalf of the
Council of the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders, an organisation whose
prime objective was to protect the interests of investors in sovereign bonds,
then it is evident that both sources point to similar influences on
bondholders’ expectations during the period in question. The statistical
analysis shows that public debt and fiscal performance, two key macro
economic fundamentals, played an important role in determining investors’
expectations. These two determinants are equally prominent in the Greek
Extracts.

public debt which includes announcements of place and dates for coupon and bond payments; news on raising fresh capital
from the international markets and Athens; summaries of reports of the I.F.C.; Actions of the I.F.C. which includes news related
to the Commission and Others.
(2) It is worth noting that summaries of the I.F.C. reports provided detailed information on the collection of the public revenues
assigned to the Commission and were often published on behalf of the Council of the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders.
(3) Every year, in February or March the I.F.C. announced the interest rate that they would pay beyond the minimum rate fixed
by the ‘Law of Control’ for loans under their jurisdiction contracted before 1897.
