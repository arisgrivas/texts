10 Economic thought and monetary policy in nineteenth-century Greece
Yiorgos Stassinopoulos
Introduction
The study of monetary issues, especially those raised during the nineteenth century, has been flourishing in the last few years. Modern scholars of this subject attempt to draw conclusions for contemporary monetary problems, identify and explain how historians of economic thought approach these issues. Many consider the nineteenth century as the period during which the foundation of monetary science occurred (Schumpeter, 1954: 688). A significant quantity of books, pamphlets, articles etc. was published almost exclusively – in one country, Great Britain, the leading and most dynamic industrial state of the time. Britain’s serious problems in its monetary system from the beginning of the century up to the 1850s, triggered long and controversial debates. The British controversies led to the formulation of the so-called ‘monetary orthodoxy’ (Fetter, 1978), which coincided and influenced the creation and the course of significant credit institutions in Continental Europe (Kindleberger, 1987: 100–51). Although there is a vast bibliography on monetary thought in Great Britain, the dissemination of these ideas has not been studied thoroughly in Continental Europe, especially in less developed countries. The repercussion of monetary controversies reached Greece, a newly established and small country at the time. The Greek intelligentsia used these controversies while trying to analyse the monetary problems of the country. The transmission of economic ideas to Greece took place through various channels (e.g. translations of relevant literature, articles in newspapers etc.). The most important input came, however, from the work of the Greek economists who incorporated European ideas into their work. It is now widely acknowledged that this transmission is not only a simple transfer of ideological schemes; it also comprises social, cultural and other elements. Especially in Greece, the arrival of political economy marched alongside liberal political ideas (Kitromilides, 1988) and many of its doctrines were used for the rationalization of the political and economic procedures during the formative years (Petropulos, 1968).

This chapter outlines aspects of Greek economic thought during the nineteenth century, as a contribution to a comparative history of the evolution of monetary policy and the diffusion of economic ideas across Europe throughout the nineteenth century. It focuses especially on the policy followed by the National Bank of Greece, which was the issuing bank and the most powerful economic institution in Greece during that period.
Origins of the Greek banking system
The Greek state faced serious problems concerning its economic organization from the very first moment of its formation. The long revolt against Ottoman rule (1821–7) and political conflicts between the local leaders for the leadership’s take-over obstructed the growth of the Greek economy (Petropulos, op. cit.). Loans that Protecting Powers provided to the Greek government (1824–5) (that reached Greece truncated) were not sufficient to cover the needs of the Greek economy in money. The production was agricultural and the rudimentary exchanges were made mainly through barter. The existence of usury as a result of the scarcity of capital, and an old-fashioned taxation, delayed the development of agriculture. Ioannis Kapodistrias, the first state Governor, tried to face that scarcity through the foundation of a state-bank, which would issue inconvertible notes and have the responsibility of public finance. It was only a few years later when the Bank collapsed leaving behind social scepticism for paper money. The new leadership under the kingship of the young Otto von Wittelsbach from Bavaria dissociated the new attempts for the foundation of banks from public finance administration. The new government concept was fourfold. (1) The new bank should belong to private interests and follow the widely accepted sound banking principles. (2) The state should avoid issuing paper money. (3) The paper money issuing activity would be undertaken by a private bank. To this end the state would grant a singleissue privilege to the Bank. (4) The state would set restrictions upon the Bank, in order to avoid the danger of over-issue. The cautiousness was obvious and expressed in the rules that governed the new bank and the appointment of a Royal Commissioner on its Board of Directors. The new bank named National Bank of Greece, was founded in 1841 and was the result of combined actions by J.G. Eynard, a banker with close connections with French banking interests and the wealthy Greek Diaspora. The presence and participation in the Board of Directors of Louis Lemaitre, a French banker, further substantiates the French influence on the establishment and operation of the Bank. Lemaitre assisted the organization of the Bank and transmitted the Continental banking spirit to the Board (Vacalopoulos, 1979: 92–7). Although the state was a major contributor to the Bank’s capital, it did

not have any voice in its management and merely confined itself as a supervisor. The transactions between the Bank and the state were limited since the austerity fiscal policy of King Otto left no room for government loans from the Bank (Petrakis, 1985: 39–43). Nevertheless, the Bank was restricted by statute to grant two-thirds of its capital to long-term mortgage loans and only one-third to other kinds of loans (Valaoritis, 1902: 10). The issuing operation of the Bank was subjected to a binding constraint. The state allowed the Bank to issue notes in return for providing capital to the agricultural sector of the economy. To facilitate the diffusion of its notes, the government changed the single-issue privilege to an exclusive one and made the notes acceptable as legal tender. The concession of issue privilege to the Bank provided an exchange medium to the economy since there was nothing else but worn foreign coins. The increasing money needs from the peasantry and the merchants as well were never fully met by the Bank. The state set an upper limit in the Bank’s interest rate (which was far lower than the market rate) in order to constrain usury. The restriction of the Bank to fluctuate its interest rate was an intrinsic impediment, since the demand for discount and mortgage loans was large and pressing and the Bank could not respond accordingly. To confront the extensive demand, the Bank followed a conservative credit policy, lending mainly solvent merchants by discounting bills of exchange with maturities not exceeding sixty days and bearing at least three signatures by reliable guarantors. Moreover, the agricultural sector did not enjoy a significant capital flow. This could be attributed, inter alia, to two reasons: first, the shortterm loans were favoured by the Bank’s issuing operation and that operation determined, grosso modo, the morphology of its grants to the private sector. There was a firm belief in the Board of Directors that if the Bank allowed mortgage loans on a large scale, liquidity pressure would possibly incur on its assets holdings. Second, because of the vagueness of the property rights and property registration, the Bank was unwilling to satisfy the extensive demand for mortgage loans. As the Ottomans withdrew from Greek territory, the newly established Greek state was left with substantial new land. The state granted only a small part of this new land to the landless peasantry. Consequently a large-scale land grabbing occurred, which was further aggravated by the lack of a cadastre. Thus, the Bank was unwilling to dispose an extensive part of its capital to mortgage loans, since they were neither secured nor could the assignment of the mortgages be checked. As explained by an executive member of the Bank in a parliamentary session, investigating that issue, ‘the Bank could not find the proper securities for the mortgage loans, which are the most wanted from the public’.1

The issuing policy of the National Bank of Greece
As mentioned earlier the National Bank of Greece was operating mainly as a discount rather than as a mortgage bank. Its main object was the monetization of economic exchanges and the penetration of its notes in traditional economic activities. The Bank faced hostility in this attempt from the local moneylenders, who feared that they would lose the predominance they enjoyed, before its foundation, in the political and economical sphere. They antagonized the Bank hard, forcing it to incorporate them in the Board of Directors. Furthermore, the Bank tried (and finally succeeded in) using the usurers as intermediaries in order to expand the circulation of its notes. The spreading of its notes gave the Bank the chance to collect the various coins in its vaults, which were either circularized or hoarded, and to employ them as a metal reserve. The maintenance of convertibility and the sound management made the use of notes attractive and lent them credibility. In order to assist the spreading of its notes the bank created overdrafts, a ‘novel’ short-term credit instrument (Thomadakis, 1985: 59–60). That policy was the vehicle used by the Bank to maximize the volume of its outstanding notes. The issuing activity, in turn, constituted the most profitable source of its operations and it was this activity that gave high dividends to shareholders and made the Bank’s shares attractive to the public eye. Moreover, it created the conditions to augment its capital and consequently its social power. The Bank’s issue policy resembled those of the eighteenth-century country banks in England and nineteenth-century provincial banks in France (Niebyl, 1946: 22 et seq.; Nishimura, 1995: 537–43), a practice that was theoretically backed by the supporters of the Banking School. The main exponent of that policy was Efthimios Kehayias (1819–85), a practising banker and a gifted orator who succeeded in becoming Deputy Governor of the Bank, member of the Parliament and responsible for the Exchequer (1862–3 and 1866–7). According to Kehayias, the quantity of circulating notes was determined by the public demand or, viewed from a different angle, it was the level of economic activity that set the demand for notes. The Bank lacked the power to influence the quantity of notes in circulation. Its role was confined to maintaining and monitoring a balanced relation between notes and metal reserve; thus minimizing the likelihood of upsetting their convertibility. Even if the Bank issued more notes than needed (by the public), the unwanted amount would return to its coffer resulting in a demand for coins. Thus the law of the market prevented the Bank from depreciating its notes by issuing them to excess:
The Bank issues more notes than enough, but they remain in circulation only as long as the needs and the volume of exchange allow; those in excess return to the Bank’s vaults . . . No matter how many

notes the Bank issues, the exact amount in circulation is determined by the needs of exchange, because banknotes are only an instrument of exchange. (Kehayias, 1927: 25–6)
It is clear, that the above-mentioned approach contains a version of the socalled Law of Reflux.2 The dominant conception of the Bank’s Board of Directors was that the retaining mechanism of notes by the public was responsible for the volume of the outstanding notes, rather than the discount of the short-term bills by the Bank.3 The Bank’s preference in maintaining short-term assets in its portfolio was based on the perception that these securities were more flexible in cases of market’s panic, when the public wants to hold specie instead of notes. In such cases the pressure on its metal reserve would be more limited if the Bank retained short-term securities, which could be easier to liquidate and assist the contraction of the currency. In other words, the volume of the discounted bills was not, in the Directors’ perception, the criterion, which allowed the Bank to avoid over-issuing its liabilities, as the Smithian analysis implied (Smith, 1976: 304). In a borderline case, a contractive policy could reduce danger by the tightening of grants and by demanding its claims to be paid. The short-term grants helped the Bank to influence the liquidity of the market, in contrast with long-term mortgage loans, which were not easily liquidable. A necessary condition for the operation of that mechanism was the existence of a large metal reserve by the Bank, which could maintain the convertibility. That’s why the Bank never tempted to issue notes without keeping a sufficient quantity of specie to answer for payments. An explicit rule of thumb of the Directors of the Bank was to contract loans in periods of crisis and keep a large metal reserve. This was considered as an adequate safeguard against over-issuing. The Bank’s administration therefore regarded the restrictions set by the Bank Charter Act as unnecessary.
The bank as lender of last resort
The term lender of last resort belongs to the nineteenth-century economic literature, and means the willingness of a bank ‘to give assurance that it would lend in time of crisis’ (Fetter, 1978: 262). The first time the National Bank was asked to play a similar role was during the 1848 crisis. The origins of this crisis can be traced in the 1847 English crisis and the political events taking place in Continental Europe at the beginning of 1848. The Greek merchants were in great need of sending specie abroad, because of the contraction of foreign mercantile credit. At the same time, the Bank suffered a large run on its reserve, which was reduced to 60% in one month. The situation was extremely dangerous and the Bank appointed a Committee to investigate the causes and find appropriate solutions. The Governor of the Bank was eager for suspension of pay

ments in order to protect its bullion. On the other hand, the press tried to force the Bank to buy gold at a premium to meet the demands and to redeem its notes in terms of gold. Finally the committee agreed with the Governor’s propositions and the Bank asked the government to suspend the convertibility of its notes. The government allowed the Bank to postpone redemption, regarding its notes as six-month 10% interest bearing bills. This measure was burdensome to the Bank and as a response it led to a dramatic contraction of loans to the private sector (Palamas, 1930: 22–4). During the suspension the main issue was the policy of the National Bank and its responsibility towards merchants. Two opposing arguments for the proper banking policy appeared during that period. On the one side we find the merchants–shareholders, who argued that while credit collapsed, the Bank ought to act as lender of last resort. Loukas Rallis, a wealthy merchant, asked that liquidity be increased to relieve the market from pressure and to help the healthy part of commerce. He also believed that the Bank should overcome the crisis along with commerce rather than move the effects of the crisis on the merchants. Another merchant, Michalis Iatros, supported the idea that the Bank should follow open market operations in an effort to dampen the amplitude of the market crisis.4 On the other side were the leading members of the Board of Directors, most prominent were Kehayias and Ioannes Soutsos. Soutsos (1804–90) was the first academic economist who taught classical political economy from the podium of Athens University for nearly half a century. He was also a shareholder of the Bank and served as an influential advisor for many years. He is considered as the patriarch of Greek economists and was respected by both scientists and politicians. His primary concern was to minimize the effect the crisis had on the Bank, since a liquidity shortage could lead to a credit distortion. That’s why he argued for the contraction of the grants in order to avoid credit expansion, which could make the return to convertibility impossible. This view was dominant within the Bank and subsequently this policy was adopted for six months.5 The choice of the Bank was also based on its wish to reduce the extent of speculative activity upon its notes. The Bank not only refused to accept the responsibility of the lender of last resort in 1848, but also never did so until the end of the century. Given the restrictions on the interest rate, the Bank was unable to exert an effective influence on paper circulation unless through contraction in discounting. The maintenance of banknotes’ parity contradicted with the role of lender of last resort, even if the Bank had the potential to smoothen the consequences of the crisis. The liquidity could only be safeguarded by holding a sufficient amount of specie and by reducing advances to its customers (bill discounting and overdrafts). For example, during the 1858 crisis (which was the echo of the 1857 world crisis)

assistance to the merchants was limited, because, as the Bank claimed, it would violate the ceiling on maximum circulation set forth by the government (Valaoritis, 1902: 30). Another striking example of its stance was the closure of the overdrafts in 1875, for minimizing the pressure on its notes during that year’s crisis. A later (and most eminent) exponent of the Bank’s responsibility towards the productive sector of the economy was I. Zografos (1844–1927), a student of K.H. Rau and professor of public finance at the University of Athens for a short period of time. Zografos was of the opinion that the Bank systematically overlooked the dual role which had been entrusted on it by the state, as supplier of loanable funds and currency as well. It also held a central position in the economy and ought to undertake the responsibility implied by its institutional role in the financial system. That is why he opposed the policy of liquidity shortage during a crisis, because that policy resulted in market suffocation and the ruin of entrepreneurs. In addition, Zografos claimed, the Bank lacked incentives for the encouragement of the productive forces as it could rest on gains from the issue privilege. For that reason he put forward the idea of the Bank separating its activities to banking and issuing departments, following the example of the Bank of England (Zografos, 1925: I, 114). That idea however, was never seriously considered from the political leadership during the nineteenth century. Zografos should not be considered as an adherent of the Currency School. On the contrary (following the spirit of the German historical school) he was a firm believer of the ‘productive credit’ and the Bank’s responsiveness to the needs of trade and industry. He believed in the power of the banking sector to vitalize the productive activity, without any inflationary pressure in the monetary side of the economy.
The state interference in monetary policy
The ascension to the throne of young King George I, as well as the political changeover of 1864, cultivated new hopes for the development of the Greek economy. These expectations were partly verified by the facts of the following years. The production recovered while the remarkable, over 50% increase of population in a short span of time, reflected the new dynamic (1,096,810 inhabitants in 1861 to 1,679,470 in 1879 (Andreades, 1939: 185)). At the same time, the first signs of state interventionism came to the fore, such as the modernization of the tariff system and the monetary reform, both in 1867. A broad public discussion concerning the encouragement of infant Greek industry and the role of the state in this procedure was raised (Psalidopoulos, 1994). The inflexible policy of the balanced budget was also abandoned during this period and a more flexible policy was adopted as far as the public debt was concerned. After the expulsion of King Otto, and the

increasing fiscal deficits during the years 1862–5, led to a new relationship between the state and the Bank. From that moment on, a relation of mutual dependence existed. The Bank kept the issue privilege, and the state could borrow from the Bank to finance its fiscal deficits. Subsequently, whereas in 1858 the state owed nothing to the Bank, in 1867 the public debt to the Bank was raised to huge levels (Valaoritis, 1902: 43–4). That practice became permanent during the following years. The autonomy of the Bank was seriously jeopardized in 1868. The Cretan revolt, which broke out in 1866, was at its peak at the end of 1868. The situation was crucial and Prime Minister D. Voulgaris pressed the Bank to lend the state its total bullion immediately in order to help the Cretan fighters. The Bank refused and the government threatened that it would issue fiat money, repealing de facto the Bank’s issue privilege. The Bank gave in and the government suspended convertibility for the second time (Palamas, 1930: 29–30). The 1868 episode proved to the Bank’s directors that the issue privilege could not be taken for granted any more. In other words if the Bank wished to maintain its preferential position, it should give in more easily to governments’ claims. In the 1870s the Bank increased loans to the public sector by complementary reductions in private borrowing. To be more specific, in the period from 1861 to 1865, private borrowing represented 97% of the total Bank’s loans while in the period from 1876 to 1880 it was reduced to 62% and in the next five years to 52% (Thomadakis, 1981: 111). Moreover from 1874 on, treasury bills could back the banknotes. That potential changed the portfolio composition of the Bank. While in 1871–5, 62% of the portfolio of the Bank consisted of short-term bills of exchange, in the 1880s that proportion decreased to 30% (Thomadakis, 1981: 120). Soutsos criticized the repeated and relatively easy state resorts to the Bank’s funds and argued ‘the Bank’s sacrifices for government should not be unlimited’.6 He opposed the yielding by the Bank’s directors to the state’s demands, fearing that increased public borrowing could lead to a never-ending over-issue. Soutsos reminded the directors that the Bank issues notes against bills of exchange rather than exchequer bills. Thus, the volume of the outstanding amount should be equal to the number of discounted bills existing in the Bank’s portfolio. He also believed that an issuing Bank’s portfolio ought to consist of liquid securities in order to avoid the suspension of convertibility and the lack of public confidence (Soutsos, 1884: I, 459). Moreover, he opposed credit expansionist views, such as those articulated by Stamos Trikaliotis, with the argument that such a policy would end in monetary distortions. Trikaliotis taught as ‘ifigitis’ (reader) political economy for several years at the University of Athens. He relied on Macleod’s theory of banking in order to prove the power of banking to increase the productive capital of the country. Trikaliotis viewed banknotes as credit instruments in themselves that were acceptable by the public because of mutual consent.

Consequently their value was only determined by the quantity, which was in circulation (Trikaliotis, 1868). If the Bank allowed more advances to farmers and small businessmen, it could heal the scarcity of money and help the efforts of the government to fight the widespread usury. It could also provide the small Greek industries with productive capital and give employment to many labourers who remained inactive in the rural areas. Trikaliotis’s main concern was the promotion of the infant Greek industry and the stimulation of native production. Trikaliotis was an eager supporter of the Scottish banking system and an advocate of the vital role that credit could play in an under-developed country such as Greece. It was not before the mid-1870s that the policy of the Bank was seriously questioned. The significant augmentation of its capital and the tremendous expansion of its assets were obviously in contradiction to the comparative backwardness of the economy. However, it was also apparent that the Bank did not want to act as the ‘locomotive’ for the infant industry and agriculture. On the contrary, as Zografos pointed out, the Bank was willing enough to supply extensive loans to the state instead of the productive agents of the economy. This policy brought, for Zografos, inflationary pressure to the economy and progressively made the state unable to pay off its liabilities to foreign debtors. A clear-cut example was the increasing price of foreign exchange. Zografos was convinced that this increase was directly related to the issue expansion and the imprudent policy of the Bank. The warning sign in the form of premium at foreign exchange would be sufficient to induce the Bank to corrective steps. However, the Bank’s policy was far different (Zografos 1925: I, 100–15). Another economist who castigated the close relationship between the Bank and the state was Aristides Economos (1835–90), editor of the scientific journal Oikonomiki Epitheorissis (Economic Review), and proponent of the classical school (Psalidopoulos, 1996). For Economos and other liberal writers such as Soutsos and A. Vernardakis (1844–1912) the problem was rooted in the monopoly situation created by the granting of the issue privilege from the state to one single bank. Moreover, they considered the growing lending of the Bank’s capital to the state as the main source of the stagnation of Greek economy and the poor development of the native industry; the only alternative was the establishment of a free-banking system. Vernardakis characterized the existence of one single bank of issue as retrogressive and a feudal residue. He also proposed the establishment of a Mortgage Bank (according to the French Credit Foncier), which would issue mortgage-bonds that could operate as money, assisting the landowners to escape from usury (Vernardakis, 1885: 283–95). The cooperative banks were also very popular as an idea among Greek economists, an idea stemming from Prussia, where many such banks had been established as a result of Hermann Schultze-Delitsch’s initiative (Kindleberger, op. cit., p. 129). It was widely believed that these banks would cultivate a saving-habit among the workers and petty merchants and

thereby provide capital to commerce. The intellectual and politician D. Mavrocordatos saw in the formation of the cooperative banks the remedy to the emerging Social Question, which would result ‘in the increasing depression of the working class’ (1869: 21–2).
The establishment of inconvertibility
At the end of the 1870s, a number of upheavals took place in the Balkans. The Eastern Question was at its height. The warlike preparations of the Greek government reflected its agony to take advantage of potential border changes and to liberate the remaining Greeks who were still under the Ottoman rule (Dakin, 1972). The influence of ‘the Megali Idea’ (namely the vision of a big Greek state that could embrace the Greek Diaspora living in the Balkans) was widespread among people and politicians alike. Nevertheless, the state, once more, was unable to finance these expensive preparations. Subsequently, the government not having other options suspended the convertibility of banknotes for a third time in a span of forty years. This time however, it was not for a short period. The government made use of the extensive internal borrowing and the opening of foreign money markets (after a compromise between the Greek state and the debtors upon the loans granted during the War of Independence), to finance public works. These works, such as the making of a railroad net, the opening up of the Corinth Canal etc. improved the infrastructure of the Greek economy and, alongside the inflationist policy in effect at the same time, were used by the Greek government for the mobilization of the dormant potentialities of Greek economy (Vergopoulos, 1994: 142). However, that policy was open to criticism as being responsible for a number of negative phenomena, such as the premium upon the foreign exchange and the surcharge of the foreign-debt amortization. The large majority of Greek economists and the press as a whole claimed for the resumption of the convertibility. At the same time, dissenting arguments in support of the advantages that a forced currency could bring to the Greek economy appeared. One of the proponents of these arguments was Nikolaos Gounarakis (1852–1932), reader (and later professor) at the University of Athens and champion of the weak bimetallism movement in the country. Gounarakis favoured the encouragement of the domestic production and questioned whether the resumption could heal the macroeconomic problems of Greek society or not. He considered that the excess supply of money was offset by a corresponding demand in the real sector of the economy. He claimed that despite the short-term side effects that the money-increase could cause in the monetary circulation, long-term benefits would be more advantageous to the whole economy. At the core of his arguments lay a version of the forced savings doctrine. According to him, the increase in the quantity of money would decrease the labour cost (because of the

fixed incomes) and entrepreneurs could invest that surplus in additional production. It could also lead to the proportional increase of exports since the Greek products would be cheaper to the foreign markets (Gounarakis, 1913: 227–8). He also believed that only the gradual improvement of public finance alongside with the promotion of industry would lead to the development of the Greek economy. The journalist G.S. Floros, another adherent of Macleod, expressed similar views. Floros was of the opinion that the merits of the suspension could be found in the use of a cheap medium, free from the limitations a convertible banknote was subjected to. The use of an inconvertible banknote, under particular limitations, could induce the economy into growth. Moreover he feared that the resumption of convertibility would be disastrous for the whole economy and depressive for the market, because the withdrawal of a big part of banknotes, along with the lack of specie, could cause a liquidity vacuum. He claimed that an increase in money supply would stimulate the commercial activity and consequently augments the bulk of production (Floros, 1883). The aforementioned arguments had limited influence on the political leaders of that period. The Prime Minister of the 1882–5 period, Harilaos Trikoupis (1832–96), declared that nothing was most desirable than the rapid abolition of the cours forcé. For that purpose, he raised loans in specie from abroad. In addition, he tried to enforce the state to repay the loans to the National Bank of Greece. Trikoupis regarded the lack of specie and the depreciation of banknotes as the two sides of the same coin and he believed that the only way to escape from this vicious circle was the return to convertibility. He adopted the propositions of the liberal economists (such as Soutsos) and regarded as an evil the continuance of government lending through inconvertible banknotes. We can thus identify a strong influence of liberal economists on his policy, as they believed that the redundancy of paper money distorted the economic process. In their view the absence of metal coins was convincing enough of an excessive supply of the inconvertible paper money. These liberals were however sceptic on the reckless restoration of convertibility. The budget was not yet balanced and the repeal of inconvertibility was not a sufficient enough condition to restore the equilibrium and promote economic growth (Soutsos, 1985: II, 691). At the same time, the Bank argued for the postponement of the resumption, at least for two years or so, in order to augment its capital. Under such circumstances, the transaction to a convertibility régime not only would be smoother, but it would also help defuse the pressure on the markets. However, the government did not take heed of that warning and the Bank as a vindictive response moved to restriction on granting credit, creating a liquidity shortage. At the end of 1884, the convertibility was resumed and the Bank faced a massive drain of its bullion by a rapid conversion of its notes to specie. In

January 1885, the Bank’s reserve stood at 48 million drachmae and after five months it had shrunk to 26 million (Valaoritis, 1902: 94). That fact, alongside the change of government and the new warlike preparations, led the economy to the old régime, i.e. the suspension of convertibility once and for all. However, this time the effects of the cours forcé would be disastrous. The financing of the fiscal deficit through the issuing of notes led to the insolvency of the state and the 1893 crisis, when under the pressure of the culminating debt, the state defaulted on its foreign debt. The most important outcome was the imposition of foreign supervision in 1898, so Greece could meet its obligations to foreign lenders.
Conclusion
The aim of this chapter was to sketch out the way the monetary problems of the newly established Greek state were examined by the Greek economists. An attempt was also made to trace influences of other contemporary economists and how these were assimilated in their discourses. On a strict theoretical level, even though the analysis tried to avoid the rather narrow – and sometimes ‘procrustean’ (O’Brien, 1993: 3) schemes of Banking-Currency Schools classification, we should notice the wide acceptance of the Banking School doctrine among Greek economists. At the same time, the total absence of supporters of the Currency School could be regarded as a deviation from the canon of monetary orthodoxy. On the one hand this situation could be attributed to the particularities of the Greek credit system, that resembled the assumptions of the Banking School, and the influences coming from Continental Europe where the Banking School enjoyed a wide acceptance (Rist, 1966: 229–38). On the other hand dissenting theories (such as those of Macleod) in which credit plays a significant role, found eager audience in a society that was starving for capital. The above analysis reveals that the theoretical approach of Greek economists should be examined within the socio-economic context of the times. Attention should also be given to the institutional development of the function of money throughout the century. Thus, while in the first period the banknote constituted the medium for the monetization and modernization of the whole economy, from the early 1870s it was used as a financing source for the fiscal deficits. This transformation on the character of the medium reflects the ever-changing reality of the Greek economy and the goals set by the political leadership. The Greek economists did not remain passive in this process. Much economic literature of this time has focused on policy recommendations since the monetary policy was directly associated with the question of the development of the Greek economy. Generally speaking, we could identify two opposing approaches regarding the monetary action that should have been followed by the National Bank of Greece and the state. The liberal perception alleged that state interference in the money supply

endangered monetary stability and consequently distorted the market’s operation. The high price of bullion was the result of growing government debt, which was directly associated with war-related financing and extensive investment policy (adopted by the state in the 1880s) based on foreign and internal lending. Moreover, the liberal perception also argued that the close association of the National Bank of Greece with treasury needs deprived a considerable volume of credit from the productive process. Modern scholars underscore the increasing public borrowing and delineate its impact on the economic development of Greek society (Zolotas 1926; Agriantoni, 1986), while others claim that the potentialities at least for industrial enterprises were missing (Hadziiosif, 1993). On the antipode many intellectuals, impressed by the development of the German economy and the contribution of the German banks to this process, considered the unwillingness of the banks to finance industrial clients with investment funds as the main cause of the backwardness of the Greek economy. For them a ‘universal banking policy’, along with state intervention, would strengthen the infrastructure of the Greek economy and help the state escape from the economic and social stagnation. The increasing financial difficulties that the state faced at the end of the century, in connection with the major monetary problems, was the starting-point of a new round of debates upon the establishment of a sound monetary system on the eve of the twentieth century (Katselides, 1902). Parallel to these debates, the National Bank of Greece readjusted its position and progressively accepted a more central role in the Greek economy.
