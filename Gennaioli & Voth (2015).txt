Powerful, centralized states controlling a large share of national income only begin to appear in Europe after 1500. We build a model that explains their emergence in response to the increasing importance of money for military success. When fiscal resources are not crucial for winning wars, the threat of external conflict stifles state-building. As finance becomes critical, internally cohesive states invest in state capacity while divided states rationally drop out of the competition, causing divergence. We emphasize the role of the "Military Revolution", a sequence of technological innovations that transformed armed conflict. Using data from 374 battles, we investigate empirically both the importance of money for military success and patterns of state-building in early modern Europe. The evidence is consistent with the predictions of our model.

Capable states cannot be taken for granted. States as we know them today only appear 1500 in Europe. Earlier European rulers possessed limited tax powers; there was no profes bureaucracy; armies were largely composed of mercenaries; and powerful elites were of above the law (Tilly, 1990). Within three short centuries, however, European powers lai foundations for modern states, especially by surging ahead of the rest of the world in ter fiscal capacity.

2. HISTORICAL BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
War was common in early modern Europe. Between 1500 and 1700, a Great Power war w underway in 95% of all years, as shown in Table 1 (Levy, 1983). And yet, numerous war also fought elsewhere and in earlier periods. Europe saw extended conflict during the med period, from the Reconquista in Spain to the Hundred Years War between England and Fran to innumerable wars between Italian city states. Similarly, China experienced prolonged c during the "warring states period", between 475 BC and 221 BC, and Bali in the pre-colon saw frequent wars (Hui, 2005; Nordholt, 2010). In neither medieval Europe, nor Bali, nor e China did frequent warfare coincide with the creation of highly capable and centralized s Why did "war make states" in Europe after 1500, but fail to do so elsewhere? Our answer to this puzzle is that aggressive state-building was shaped by an interacti between European political starting conditions and changes in military technology, the called "Military Revolution". Before describing it in more detail, we briefly summarize explanandum - the rise in state capacity in early modern Europe.
3. Our contribution also touches on the vast literature studying the economic consequences of institut (Acemoglu et al., 2001, 2005; Acemoglu, 2005; Delong and Shleifer, 1993; Greif, 1993; North, 1989). This lite does not explicitly consider the role of external conflict, but it sometimes argues that war can overcome domesti problems that stand in the way of better institutions (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2006).

2.1. The rise of state capacity
Two features of state-building in Europe after 1500 stand out - a large increase overall, and growing divergence in the cross-section. Figure 2 plots tax pressure in major European powers over time (which we define as the per capita tax take as a multiple of the country- specific urban wage). Tax pressure in England increased 10-fold, from 1.5 to 15.5; in the Ottoman Empire, on the other hand, it actually fell from 1.7 to 1.5. 4 In combination, differences in tax pressure and growth increased variation in the cross-section of European powers considerably. In 1500, Poland's total revenue was half of England's. In 1780, it was equivalent to only 5%. The overall tax take grew strongly because of both population growth and rising tax pressure. In 1500, the combined revenue for all major European powers was 214 tons p.a. Some 280 years later, this had increased by a factor of twenty, to 4400 tons p.a. New administrative structures facilitated the rise in income. Medieval rulers largely financed their expenses with domain income (Landers, 2003). After 1500, this became increasingly impossible. To raise sufficient revenue, states needed to levy taxes on a substantial scale. This entailed administrative capacity-building and reform. For example, by 1780, Britain had centralized collection of excise and customs taxes, and was about to introduce the first successful
income tax in history. France, on the other hand, continued to use tax farming for both direct and indirect taxes all the way up to the French Revolution (Bonney, 1981), and numerous tax exemptions hamstrung attempts to raise revenue. Nonetheless, it succeeded in raising tax pressure. Changes in tax collection were part of a broader pattern of administrative reforms. Old privileges in composite states increasingly came under attack, but the pace and success of reforms
4. The value of silver declined, but only gradually. The real increase was still by a factor of more than 1 3 (Hamilton, 1934).

Spain, on the o fragmentation of its internal market, or to extend taxation 1963). Reforms in Poland foundered on the unanimity nobles.
2.2. The "Military Revolution"
The use of gunpowder was a turning point for military technology. The spread of cannon after 1400 meant that medieval walls could be destroyed quickly. Fortresses that had withstood yearlong sieges in the Middle Ages could fall within hours. In response, Italian military engineers devised a new type of fortification - the trace italienne. It consisted of earthen bulwarks, covered by bricks, which could withstand cannon fire. These new fortifications were immensely costly to build.5 The existence of numerous strongpoints meant that wars often dragged on for long
periods of time - winning a battle was no longer enough to control a territory.6 The introduction of standing armies also added to rising costs. Due to the need for firearms training, states began to organize, equip, and drill soldiers, effectively investing in their human capital. Starting with William of Nassau's reforms during the Dutch rebellion, soldiers were garrisoned and trained continuously. In combination, these changes drove what some historians have called a "Military Revolution" (Roberts, 1956; Parker, 1996) - war became much more costly because of technological change, growing army size, and increasing professionalization. Military capacity also grew over time, but diverged sharply between different powers (Table 2). At one end of the spectrum, England's armed forces tripled in size between 1550 and 1780. France's army increased by a factor of five, and Austria's, by a factor of 28. In contrast, Poland was partitioned out of existence as a result of military impotence caused by internal strife and fiscal weakness.
5. The fortress of Besancon was so expensive that when informed of the total cost, Louis XIV allegedly asked if they were made of gold (Parker, 1996). 6. Roger Boyle, the British soldier and statesman observed in the 1670s (Parker, 1996): "Battells do not now decide national quarrels, and expose countries to the pillage of conquerors, as formerly. For we make war more like foxes, more than lyons; and you will have 20 sieges for one battell." [original spelling]

European states not only fought with great frequency; t losers to winners. This took three main forms - conquests overseas possessions, and war indemnities. At its most from the map, as did Poland. Even in less extreme substantial. In the 42 main peace settlements in Euro million square kilometers were redistributed - equivalen Conquests in Europe like Silesia, Alsace-Lorraine, and th tax revenues to their new rulers, as did the transfer of massive overseas territories like Canada.
In the long run, the newly incorporated territories were often taxed according to the new ruler's fiscal system (Prussia doubled the tax revenue from Silesia). In the shorter term, however, the existing tax infrastructure was used by the occupying power. Revenues could be substantial Frederick the Great extracted 55-82 million Thaler from occupied Saxony, Mecklenburg, and Pomerania during the Seven Years War, enough to cover between 1/3 and 1/2 of the cost of the war (Szabo, 2013). Similarly, in redistributed colonial possessions, the new rulers typically benefitted from pre-existing investments in productive assets (like sugar plantations) and tax infrastructure. Finally, war indemnities produced substantial revenues as well. These did not constitute the wholesale seizing of another state's revenue base, but a transfer of resources accumulated as a result of earlier, effective taxation. Again, these could be high, such as the 5 million Riksdaler received by Sweden at the end of the Thirty Years War (Lee, 1991).

3.1. Production
There are three dates rÌ = 0, 1,2. A country consists of a measure 1 of identical districts i G [0, 1] located on a unit circle, each of which is inhabited by a density 1 of agents who are risk neutral and do not discount the future. Agents obtain utility by consuming the only perishable good produced in the economy. At t= 1,2, an agent can undertake either local (/) or market (m) production.8 Local production yields output A/ and occurs in an agent's own district. Market production is more profitable, it yields Am>AlÌ§, but requires the agent to carry out some steps of the production process such as input purchases in a neighbouring district (e.g. the left or right adjacent one). Agents can also engage in home production (/i), the least profitable activity ( A Â¿ < A/). If a share nx of agents undertakes activity jc = /,m,/z, where nm-'-ni~'-nh = 1, the country's total output is:
Y = nmAm + niAi + nhAh . (3.1)
Output is maximal when everybody produces for the market (nm =
3.2. State-building , taxation , and output
A self-interested ruler finances his expenditures using his domain in are no financial markets.9 The ruler can tax local and market product be taxed. The equilibrium pattern of taxation depends on the degree Consider first a fully centralized country. The ruler sets uniform ta where rx is the tax on activity jc = /, m . Since market production yie production, the optimal taxes (r*, r*) seek to: (i) discourage local a extract productive surplus. This is attained by setting:
^ Al-Ah * _ Am -Ah /o
1 - ^ Al ' m~ * _ Am â¢ ( /o '
At these taxes, nm = 1 and the ruler extracts the full surplus (Am -Ah) from market production. Consider the opposite benchmark of a fully decentralized country. The administration of each district i is delegated to a local power holder (e.g. a nobleman) who sets taxes (rij,rmj) on local and market output. There are two differences with respect to centralization. First, market production initiated in district i is now taxed also in the neighbouring district i' where it occurs: an agent operating in districts i and i' pays a total tax rate of + and his net income is - - Local production is only taxed at home. Secondly, control over taxation allows each power holder to grab a share of tax revenues for himself. For simplicity, power holders keep all local tax revenues for themselves, but our results extend to milder assumptions. Appendix A proves that in a symmetric equilibrium where each power holder i noncooperatively sets optimal taxes (r ij, rmj), we have:
Lemma 1. There always exist symmetric equilibria in which all districts set taxes Â¿ = (A/ Ah) /Ai and > 1 - (A' +A/l)/2Aw. In these equilibria , everybody engages in local production.
8. As we will see later, the model assumes that production occurs at t= 1,2 because at / = 1 fiscal revenues are used to finance war, while at t = 2 they are used for the ruler's consumption. 9. Our results go through if the ruler has some ability to borrow/lend in financial markets. A ruler's ability to borrow today increases in the fiscal revenues he can generate in the future. Thus, adding borrowing would fundamentally change our analysis (other than allowing rulers more flexibility to finance spending).

In our model, state formation is shaped by the tension between the advantages of a national market and the opposition against central rulers by local princes, cities, and estates. This rationalizes the notion that marketization and the "commercial revolution" contributed importantly to the rise of capable states in early modern Europe (Tilly, 1990; Karaman and Pamuk, 2010). Throughout, we assume that B > (Am -Ah)/(AÂ¡ - Ah), which implies that fiscal revenues are below (Am -Ah)' in other words, centralization in autarky is interior, Kaut < 1.
4. WAR AND STATE-BUILDING
There are two-countries, "home" H and "foreign" F. At t= ' they enter armed conflict wi probability 0. If 0 = 0, peace is guaranteed and each ruler makes decisions in autarky; if 6 = war occurs with certainty. Parameter 6 captures war triggers unrelated to rulers' economic pay such as empire-building motives, religious conflict, and inter-ruler rivalry. We assume that events always trigger war. In Section 5.2, we allow rulers to choose whether or not to go to conditional on the realization of a trigger. War is costly. It absorbs the fiscal revenues of both rulers while it is fought, and redistribu fiscal revenues from the losing to the winning ruler thereafter. Denote by Rj the fiscal rev available at t = 1 , 2 to the ruler of country J = //, F . If at t = 1 there is a war, each ruler spe Rj to wage it.14 At t = 2, the winner is awarded the fiscal revenues of the two countries Rh The loser obtains nothing.15 As a result, at t = 0 the consumption utility of ruler J is equ D - Cj(Rj ), where Cj(Rj) is the cost of his reform. If war does not break out, the ruler consu

At rÌ = 2, the war outcome is determined ruler consumes nothing if he loses, and he consumes Rh +Rf if he wins. The war outcome is stochastic and depends on the military strength of contestants. T

The revenue of country J: (i) drops in own domestic division (ii) increases in domestic divisions abroad c-j if and only if country J is the less cohes namely cj>c-j.
The case of symmetric countries underscores the key role of the military technology. The higher is AÌ, the greater is the rulers' investment in state-building. When warfare becomes more reliant on making large technological and organizational investments, rulers have a stronger incentive to centralize to boost their revenues and predate on their competitor. Critically, though, when the level of money sensitivity is low, X ^ 1, the presence of a war threat stifles centralization relative to a peaceful world. Formally, centralization falls with the probability of war 0. Intuitively, when X is low even the richest ruler becomes a prey with high probability, which reduces his incentive to centralize. This is the exact opposite of the conventional wisdom, according to which war necessarily fosters state-building (or leaves it unaffected). Domestic divisions are also important. Consider property (/): the ruler facing less domestic conflict (i.e. lower cost cj) is the more aggressive state builder and the more likely winner of war. Because power holders are atomistic, external conflict does not automatically transform state-building into a common interest public good. As a result, the ruler of a divided country may be unable to respond to external war as much as a cohesive opponent, creating divergence in state-building. On the other hand, property (ii) highlights that when X < 1 there are effects mitigating the extent of divergence in state-building: the ruler of the cohesive country centralizes less when his divided opponent centralizes more. This effect is due to a strategic interaction. As the divided ruler centralizes more, the cohesive ruler faces a higher risk of losing the war, which in turn reduces his incentive to centralize. This effect critically relies on having a low money sensitivity: the risk of losing to a poorer opponent is sufficiently high only when X is low. Formally, when X < 1 the reaction function of the cohesive country is negatively sloped, while that of the divided country is positively sloped. Hence, if the reaction function of the divided country shifts up, state-building in the cohesive country drops. Figure 3 shows this effect when F is the cohesive ruler (i.e. c/r <c//). What happens when money sensitivity is high? As discussed above, we cannot characterize the equilibria for X > 1 under the non-linear contest function in equation (9). Yet, even in this case, the above analysis allows us to make two useful remarks (these are proved in the Proof of Proposition 1). First, consider the case in which countries are symmetric (i.e. ch=cl). Then, if a symmetric equilibrium exists, its revenues are pinned down by in equation (16). In this case, then, a higher probability of war 0 increases state-building for X > 3. When money sensitivity is high, external war causes state-building to go up, in line with conventional wisdom. Secondly, consider the case in which countries are asymmetric (i.e. ch^cl). Then, if an interior equilibrium exists, stronger centralization by the divided ruler increases the incentive of the cohesive ruler to centralize. When money sensitivity is high, the cohesive ruler is very keen in centralizing to conquer a better prey. As a result, external war causes strong divergence in state-building.

Figure 3
Revenue-raising and military success
In sum, the military technology is critical in determining the effect of external wars on statebuilding across countries. When the money sensitivity of war is low (i.e. X < 1), military conflict causes a race to the bottom reducing state-building in all countries, and strategic interactions among reforms dampen inequality in state-building across countries. When money sensitivity is high, military conflict causes a race to the top, so that - if an interior equilibrium exists - the properties of Proposition 1 are twisted. Rulers of cohesive countries have a strong incentive to centralize, and rulers of divided countries "give up", reducing their state-building as their competitors grow stronger. To study globally the equilibrium for AÌ > 1, and to analyse in detail the interaction between military technology AÌ and inequality in domestic divisions ch/cf , we turn to a linearized version of our model.
4.2. Linearized contest success function
We linearize (4.1) around the point where both countries win with probability 1 /2, and obtain:17
P(RH,RF ) = J * (RH - Y EÌRF)- (4.8)
The money sensitivity of military strength X pins down the slope of the win probability with respect to fiscal revenues. The relative army size Lf/Lh shapes the relative effectiveness of revenues in country F, because y = (Lf /Lh)01^ . This is due to money labour complementarity.
17. Formally, equation (4.1) is linearized around the symmetric revenues (Rh, o,Rf,o) such that LffjR^ 0 = LlÌ§RxF 0. We normalize Rh, o to 1, which allows us to get rid of a multiplicative constant in our expressions, without affecting our main results.

More broadly, y ^ 1 can be accounted for by any factor making a country's militar more productive. We first consider in Proposition 2 the simplest case y = lin which the two countries effective at war. One shortcoming is that when y = 1 the contest success function in e does not allow for the strategic interactions discussed in property ii) of Proposition 1 studies the role of these strategic interactions by considering the case in which y different army sizes or productivities). In Appendix A, we prove the following result:
Proposition 2. (case y = ') Suppose that AÌ^ma x(c//,c/r)/0, so that the rulers concave. Then :
(1 ) If ClÌ§lÌ§ - cf=c, a symmetric equilibrium exists and is unique. Rulers ' revenues: ( i) increase in money intensity X, and (ii) increases in the war threat 0 if and only ifX > (3/4 )c.
(2) IfcH / cf> there is a z> 1 such that , for ^in^cy ^ z, an asymmetric equilibrium exists and is unique. In such equilibrium, R^>R p if and only if ch<cf- The equilibrium revenue of both rulers (weakly) increases in X. In addition: ( i ) the revenues of ruler J increase in the war threat 0 if and only ifX > (3/4 )cy, and (ii) if centralization is interior (kj < 1 ,V7),
higher 0 increases inequality among countries , in the sense that R^/Rp > Rh ,aut / Rf ,aut if and only if ch < c/r.
As long as money sensitivity is sufficiently low so that the ruler's maximization problem is concave, the equilibrium has a simple characterization. In the symmetric case, centralization increases with the importance of money for military success X. Critically, if X is sufficiently large relative to domestic divisions c/, the presence of a war threat now boosts state-building, in line with conventional wisdom. In other words, when fiscal revenues buy military success, rulers have a strong incentive to centralize to prey on their opponents. Point (2) highlights an interesting interaction between external war and domestic divisions. Because divided countries find it uniformly harder to centralize, war threats increase inequality in state-building. This is due to the effect - discussed in Proposition 1 - that the ruler of the internally divided country finds it hard to build a strong state. As a result, he perceives a strong risk of becoming a prey, which stunts his incentive to centralize.18 To see these effects, suppose that centralization is interior. In this case, the equilibrium revenue of ruler J is equal to:

due to increasing commercialization, which reduces the marginal cost of creating fiscal revenues in all countries. The vertical axis reports k. Three patterns of state-building can occur as a function of k. When the sensitivity of war to fiscal revenues is low relative to the cost of centralization ( k < 3-ch/4), the risk of losing fiscal revenues in a war is large even for the richer power. As a result, external war causes a race to the bottom that discourages state-building in all countries. This is is the southwest region of Figure 4. The state system is fragmented, the balance of power within political entities is unstable, and it does not lead to the emergence of a strong power. As the influence of money on military success increases, rulers become more hungry for fiscal revenues. They increasingly centralize and streamline tax administration. As a result, taxes become less distortionary, which spurs commerce and growth and makes the prospect of conquering the opponent more attractive, begetting further state-building. At some point, money sensitivity reaches the intermediate region (3 c///4<AÌ <3 c/r/4). In this case, the richer power is significantly less likely to fall prey to its opponent. As a result, external war creates strong inequality: the rulers of less divided countries disproportionately centralize while those of less powerful countries still restrain their statebuilding efforts relative to autarky. Now the international system consists of politically strong and economically developed centralized countries and weaker, poorer, less centralized countries. These laggard countries are unlikely to survive as they increasingly fall prey to the strong
ones.

Finally, as X becomes very high (AÌ>3-Cf/4), we enter a third phase where all r their state-building efforts. This is the northeast region of Figure 4. Here, rulers co full centralization benchmark where tax distortions are lowest and production is hig Consider now the case y # 1 . We focus on the case in which country H is more war-making than F , namely y < 1 . The result below then shows that in this case d be very pronounced:

F there exists a threshold y < 1 such that for all y < y higher money sensitivity X i equilibrium revenue of the cohesive country H while it decreases the revenue of country F.
If country F is both more domestically divided and weaker in the battlefield than country H {i.e. Cf > Cfj and y < 1), divergence in state-building is very strong. The strategic interaction among reforms discussed in Point (ii) of Proposition 1 play a key role here. As money sensitivity X increases, the cohesive country centralizes a lot to prey upon its weaker opponent. Unable to withstand the competition, the divided country gives up, actually reducing its state-building. In sum, military competition can cause significant departures from the conventional portrayal of war as a common interest public good that induces accelerated investments in state capacity. On the one hand, as documented in Propositions 1 and 2, higher frequency of conflict may reduce state-building in all countries when money sensitivity X is low. On the other hand, as shown by Corollary 1, high levels of money sensitivity X increase state-building in the country that is cohesive and most effective at war but reduce state-building in weaker opponents, fostering divergence.
5. INSTITUTIONS, STATE BUILDING, AND THE DECISION FOR WAR
We now show that the link between state-building and the military technology becomes stronger once one accounts for the possibility for rulers to create institutional constraints limiting their own prerogatives, as well as for their endogenous choice of whether or not to go to war.
5.1. Institutions and state -building
We view institutions as constraints limiting the ability of the central ruler to extract resources from power holders under centralization (Acemoglu et al., 2001). Institutions set the share (1 - nj) g [0, 1] of tax revenues that the ruler can extract from a centralized district in country J = H, F . The remaining share ttj of taxes goes to the power holder. As before, power holders fully retain fiscal revenues in decentralized districts. When nj = 0, the central ruler is unconstrained, as in previous
analysis. Higher n j captures greater power of legislative assemblies, constitutional review, and so forth.19
Consider the payoff implications of introducing institutions. Given an amount of fiscal revenues Rj =kj -(Am-Ah) collected in centralized districts, the total revenue accruing to the
19. This arrangement might be seen as giving to a local elite assembly control over a share ttj of revenues. We solved the model under the alternative assumption that institutions create a representative assembly of power holders that votes on whether to give fiscal revenues to the central ruler or not. Our main analysis focus on a more tractable model without this state-contingent mechanism.

central ruler is now equal to Rj = (I- nj)-Rj. The power obtains 2nj â¢ ( Am -Ah) over two periods (which is equal As a result, when a district is centralized, the loss expe 2[(A/- Ah) - 7Tj'(Am- Ah)], and falls in the strength of power holders to internalize some of the efficiency gain commitment to share these gains is sufficiently strong, na

then even local power holders gain from centralization. In this extreme case, institutions enable a mutually advantageous revenue-sharing arrangement, and there is no local opposition to statebuilding. In reality, of course, it is hard for the ruler to create institutions that are so strong. To capture this idea, we assume that the ruler must bear an increasing and convex cost K(jtj) to create institutions (implicitly, there are no institutional safeguards at the outset, ttqj =0). Provided the cost of institution-building is large enough - which we assume throughout - the ruler will set 7tJ<TtJ.
Taking this into account, at the outset each ruler optimally chooses n j; next, he sets centralization kj' finally, military and market interactions occur. By solving the model backwards, Appendix B shows that in autarky, after having optimally set institutions, the ruler's revenue is equal to:

Furthermore, Appendix B shows that in our model (as in Besley and Persson 2009), different dimensions of state development - centralization and institutional quality - cluster together. In a cohesive country, the ruler chooses to invest in institutional upgrading, particularly when he must centralize to meet an external war threat. In a divided country, only major institutional improvements can reduce opposition to centralization. This discourages the ruler from undertaking both institutional upgrading and state-building, stifling all reforms. Critically, the strength of these effects is shaped by the military technology. When AÌ is low, the external war threat dampens investments in institutions and centralization in all countries. As AÌ becomes intermediate, only the ruler of the less divided country boosts centralization and

5.2. State building and the decision for war
We now show that the link between state-building and the military technology beco once we endogenize the decision to go to war. Suppose that a war trigger arises (wit 0). Both rulers have financed their armies, they are ready to go to war, but can choose not to fight. If war is averted, each ruler enjoys his future revenues with probabili occurs, the usual war lottery is played. Critically, war destroys a share (1- a)>0 o at t = 2 in all countries. Given this deadweight loss, it would be welfare improving through negotiations, but we realistically assume that such negotiations do not o rulers cannot commit to making the necessary transfers. This implies that war doe both rulers lose from war, but it occurs when either ruler expects to benefit from it it is impossible for both rulers to gain from war).20 We now solve the model under these assumptions. This amounts to characterizin
decision of whether or not to go to war for given equilibrium revenues (/?^,/?Â£), endogenously solve for these revenues at the ex ante stage, when the probability 0 trigger and the choice to go to war are all taken into account.
To solve the model backwards, consider the last stage. Given equilibrium reven and conditional on the realization of a war event, conflict occurs either when H be
triggering a war, formally when:
p(R*HXFyÂ°(R*H+R*F)>R*H, (5.3)
or when F benefits from triggering a war, namely when:
[1 -P(R*H,R*f)'Â°{R*H+R*F)>R*F. (5.4)
War is averted if and only if none of the above conditions holds. Intuitively, equations (5.3) and (5.4) ensure that a ruler's payoff from going to war - the left-hand side in the above expressions is higher than what he can obtain by taxing only his own economy - the right-hand side above. Under the assumed symmetric contest success function [i.e. given that p(R,R)= 1/2], it is easy to show that war cannot occur in a symmetric equilibrium where countries raise the same revenue (Rh =Rf)'> in this case, going to war is like burning some fiscal revenues to toss a coin. Given risk neutrality, no ruler is willing to do it. Hence, when Rh =Rf both rulers prefer peace. The incentive to go to war arises instead if countries are unequal, namely Rh ^Rf- In this case, the war favours one contestant, who may be eager to initiate conflict. In solving for a full equilibrium, Appendix A shows that under the linear contest function, and under the assumptions of Point (2-ii) of Proposition 2 we find:
Proposition 3. Let X* be defined as the threshold such that for X < X* centralization in the two
countries is partial , namely Kj< 1 for 7 = //,F. Then , there are two thresholds Ã q, X' where
20. Jackson and Morelli (2007) discuss a different commitment problem, one in which there is full commitment to transfers (which in their setting occur in the present), but no commitment to future peace. In such a setting, the authors show that under some conditions it is possible to find a current transfer that renders future peace sustainable. In our model, contestants cannot make transfers in the current period because countries have already invested their current revenues to building an army. As a result, avoiding war requires countries to commit to making future transfers after peace has been established.

We now confront the main predictions of our model with data from early modern Europe. W examine how much money mattered for victory on the battlefield. Next, we take the est money sensitivity of war and study its interaction with domestic divisions in shaping building. In particular, we test whether increasing money sensitivity and domestic divisio explain the occurrence of declines in fiscal capacity. The goal of our analysis is not to ide the causal impact of changing war technology and domestic divisions on state-building, b assess whether the basic correlations in the data are consistent with our theory.22

Notes : The graph shows the smoothed local polynomial and 95% confidence intervals. The y-axis measures the probability of the richer power winning in battle. Note that battle outcomes are coded as either victory or draw, meaning that the probability of the poorer power winning is not equal to 1 -probability of richer power winning. The ;t-axis shows the log difference in total fiscal revenue, calculated as Diffrev=//i(7tft/) - ln{T^t), where Tntt is the tax revenue of the fiscally stronger power, Tit is the revenue of the fiscally weaker power.
Figure 5 presents a simple way of looking at the extent to which money spelled military might. We plot the local polynomial of the probability of success as a function of the (log) revenue difference between combatant states. During the period 1500-1650, richer powers enjoyed no discernable benefit - on average, they won less than 50% of the time, and a greater revenue advantage did not translate into more frequent battlefield success. After 1650, however, richer powers consistently won more often than their opponents. As the right panel in Figure 5 shows, the greater the revenue advantage, the higher the chances of success. In the second period, the richer power's probability of victory was up to three times higher than that of a poorer belligerent. To obtain a parametric estimate of money sensitivity, we run the following regression for the likelihood of success for the richer power:

Heterogeneity and tax pressure
Notes: The _y-axis measures average per capita fiscal revenue as a multiple of the average daily urban wage. The x-axis shows the terciles of the indicator of heterogeneity, ordered from 1 (lowest) to 3 (highest) - the number of predecessor states in the first quadrant, total surface area in the second, and ethnic heterogeneity in the third.
6.2.1. The effect of B. We use three indicators of domestic opposition to centralization B. First, the number of predecessor states, which proxies for the extent to which local power-holders can resist centripetal forces. For example, much of the difficulty encountered by the Spanish monarchy in raising revenue reflects territorial expansion: Castile paid high taxes, but extending the tax net to other regions only bred secessionist tendencies (Elliott, 1963). Secondly, we use total surface area of each territory as an indicator of potential opposition. Physical distance put severe constraints on an early modern ruler's ability to project power. Larger states are more likely to be culturally and linguistically diverse. Thirdly, we employ ethnic heterogeneity as a proxy for internal fragmentation. Ethnic divisions are well known to be correlated with a host of negative outcomes, including lower state capacity (Alesina and La Ferrara 2005; Herbst 2000). The number of predecessor states in 1300 is our preferred measure of pre-existing cleavages because it does not depend on the endogenous response of state-building and conquest. We define tax pressure as fiscal revenue per capita as a multiple of the daily urban wage. In this way, our results are not affected by richer countries being able to generate higher fiscal revenues simply because there is more to tax. We pool data for 17 European states over the period 15001780. As a first step, in Figure 6, we examine how tax-raising interacted with the three indicators of potential opposition to centralization - prior territorial divisions in Europe after 1500, surface area, and ethnic heterogeneity. We divide the data into terciles for each of these variables. The

regress - separately for each country - fiscal capacity on X. This yields a country-specific response to overall changes in the military importance of money. Figure 7 plots the estimated coefficients from these regressions alongside the composite measure of fragmentation. Overall, there is a strong inverse pattern: For the set of countries in the sample overall, the correlation coefficient is -0.74. The only states with a high responsiveness to growing X all have relatively low levels of fragmentation - like England and Prussia. Countries with intermediate levels of fragmentation like Austria - showed positive responses, but smaller ones than the highly homogenous powers. Finally, weak and highly fragmented states like Poland and the Ottoman Empire show barely any association between revenue raising and the military value of money.
6.2.4. Instrumental variable results. Finally, our model predicts that a more belligerent environment may be associated with greater state-building, especially as the value of money for battlefield success rises. Taking this prediction to the data is complicated by the fact that war is endogenous; it is a choice variable, which depends on fiscal revenue because fiscal strength is a predictor of military success. To sidestep the issue of reverse causation we focus on an alternative measure of belligerence the frequency of war in neighbouring states (excluding the country itself). War in Europe came in waves; for example, the maelstrom of the Thirty Years War eventually drew in powers that had initially avoided participating. More frequent war in neighbouring states during the same period should have heightened the expectation of rulers that they, too, might be affected by war. In Table 6, we use war frequency in neighbouring states during the same period as an instrument for fiscal revenue (columns 1 and 3). We find a strong and significant effect in a simple OLS setup, for two dependent variables - tax pressure (TP), the ratio of per capita tax revenue and countryspecific wages, and revenue per capita, measured in grams of silver ( RevenuePC ).

Our findings strongly suggest that there is a li increasing state capacity and the frequency of war in early modern Europe - and the show that the part of the variation reflecting the risk of war is highly correlated with fi increases.
7. CONCLUSION
Does frequent warfare lead to more state-building? We argue that the emergence of suc reflects the importance of money for military success - the direct result of changes in m technology in Europe after 1500. To analyse these effects, we build a simple model of building, and then examine the effects of war in a two-player setting. The need to fina makes money more valuable, increasing the benefits of greater state-building. When war very costly, the stronger, less fragmented power will invest in greater state capacity be the threat of war. Weaker powers then rationally drop out of the competition. Our empirical results underscore the importance of the Military Revolution. The ch of a richer power winning a battle were no greater than those of poorer powers. By t of the early modern period, richer belligerents won wars with a much higher probab We find that as military technology changed, so did state-building. In particular, afte Military Revolution, intense military conflict was associated with strong state consolida some cohesive countries, and weaker consolidation - or even reductions in fiscal capaci
in domestically divided countries. After 1650, with the Military Revolution at its pea fragmented powers were almost three times as likely to witness a decline in tax pressur their more homogenous rivals. Our analysis is not meant to explain patterns of state-building in all countries and pe The unification of both Italy and Germany took place after our period. One was the r conquest by the militarily dominant power, Piedmont, while the other came about after against external enemies by the strongest national military power, Prussia. In both cases, hi generating abilities went hand-in-hand with a substantial edge in military capability. In bot several of the smaller powers who lost their independence had long given up competing m with the dominant power. At the same time, it is worth pointing out the limits of compara Military force after the French Revolution relied on mass armies to a greater extent tha the 18th century; the ability to conscript and use large bodies of armed men required p and institutional innovations that were beyond the considerations of Louis XIV and Frede Great (Ticchi and Vindigni, 2008; Dincecco et al., 201 1). The predictions of our theory are also in line with the basic patterns of state-building in t empires - Rome, Ming Dynasty China, and the Ottoman Empire. Military technology w different in all these cases, and there was less of a need to create military might with tax rev
As our theory would predict, neither evolved a highly centralized structure of government levels of uniform tax collection. With each conquest, the Ottoman Empire simply took existing tax structure, with no attempt at imposing uniformity and centralization of c powers (Vryonis, 1969). Over time, individual provinces of the Ottoman Empire becam governing in all but name. Similarly, Roman rule typically showed a strong aversion to cent direct rule, delegating governance to local elites unless direct challenges to Roman sup dictated otherwise (Kelly, 2006).

A. PROOFS
Proof of Lemma 1. We now show that the symmetric equilibrium of Lemma 1 where only local production occurs exists. Suppose that we are in such an equilibrium (r /,</, and suppose that at the tax rate xm,d market producti less profitable than home production, namely max[0,(l -2r m,d)]Am < Ah. Is it profitable for power holder i to d to a tax rate rm,i at which market production is profitable again? The maximal tax at which the power holder of distric can induce market production is equal to:
- 1 A ~ Ah
Tm,i - - 1 A Tm,dA~mâ¢
If *m,d > (Am -Ah) /Am, the above expression is negative, so it is unprofitable for the local power holder i to deviate. If *m,d < ( Am -Ah) /Am, the tax is positive and - by fostering market production in the adjacent district - it yields a tax revenue equal to: 2 Amxm,i - 2Am( 1 - Tmd) - 2Ah,
which is less than the rent (A/ -Ah) that the power holder obtains in Lemma 1 (so that the deviation is not profitable) provided: Ai+Ah
Thus, the equilibrium of Lemma 1 exists for all parameter values.

When k < 1 the second-order condition is globally satisfied. By plugging the expression for (k/Rn)p( 1 (A.l) into equation (A.2) we can see that [1 + k (2p- 1)] ^0. Furthermore, the term 0 (k/Rn)p( 1 -p) to be always negative by plugging into equation (A.2) the expression for 2c h from equation (A. 1 ). Thus, AÌ < for the existence and uniqueness of an optimum. See Hirai and Szidarovszky (2013) for a similar point. that equation (A.l) identifies a unique best response Rh ( Rf ), we must still show that Rh (0) is positiv easy to see that this is the case because Rh (0) = (1 -0/2)/ch > 0.] To see that the equilibrium exists and is unique, consider the reaction functions. By applying the im theorem to equations (4.5) and (4.6), and by considering the analogous expressions for ruler F, we have

It is easy to C'(Rj ) is increasing, it is not possible to find a value of Rj such that both deviations are unprofitable. Consider now the conditions guaranteeing that the equilibrium exists, namely that win probabilities will look for conditions under which this is the case for any k. To do so, denote by the c = c-j the cost the strong country and zc = cj the cost parameter of the weak country, where z> 1 increases in the in countries.
By using Equation (A. 12), it is easy to see that the value of k at which the revenue difference between countries is maximized is the one at which the strong ruler -J centralizes fully, attaining R-j =(A/,- A/,). This level is identified

After some algebra, it is immediate to see that the above condition is satisfied provided z ^ IÌ, where z > 1 is a given threshold. This provides the bound on country inequality in domestic divisions that guarantees that for all values of k win probabilities are interior and a quinqu equilibrium exists.
Proof of Corollary 1. Denote autarky revenues in the two countries by (RH,aut,RF,aut)- We continue to assume heterogeneity and k are sufficiently small that the problem is concave and interior. Then, an interior equilibrium occurs at the intersection of the reaction functions:

From the above expressions one can readily obtain that:
Rh W ^h, aut '+0kRF,aut('-2y) Rf(V ~ Rf ,aut 1 ~9kRflÌ§>aut(2 y)
This expression implies that if H is the more cohesive country, so that Rh, aut > RF,aut , then external war threats (i.e. any 0 >0) increase RH(k)/RF(k) above the autarky level and this ratio increases in money sensitivity k. Furthermore, inspection of the "weak" ruler's revenue RF(k ) reveals that:
dRF(k ) <Q^,Qy{CH -Ãx)2 <(1 - y)0{(cF- 0ky)(cH~ 0k)+0k[(cF - 0ky) + y(cfj - 0AÌ)]},
dk
which is fulfilled provided y is sufficiently small (provided of course the rulers' problem is concave). It is easy to check that - provided again that the rulers' problem is concave - Z?//(AÌ) is an increasing function for y sufficiently close to 0. As a result, there exists a threshold y such that, for y < y , the revenue of the strong country H increases in k while that of the weak country F decreases in k.
Proof of Proposition 3. Under the linear-symmetric contest success function, equation (5.3) can be rewritten as:
-'-k(RlÌ§j - /?/r)lÌ§ -cr -(RlÌ§j +/?Â£) >Rh> (A. 16)
O Xa[(R%)2-(RlÌ§)2]-('-c)R*H>^^^. (A- 17)
Given the symmetry of the contest success function, equation (A. 17) can be used to study under what conditions does the stronger or weaker ruler wish to initiate a war.

Given the dependence of (/?#,/?Â£) on k in Proposition 2, it is easy to see that the left-hand side inc range where RlÌ§,RlÌ§<Rc. Define k* as the sensitivity at which R*H =RC . Then, if k*Rc > 1/2 ther that, for a > o , there exists a k i < k* such that for k > k ' condition (A. 1 8) is met. If k*Rc < 1 /2 or o <
Clearly, even though kÂ¡ < k*, for k > k* the distance R *H -R*F becomes smaller and smaller, so that k becomes large, condition (A. 18) is violated. Suppose now that F is the weak ruler, namely R*H <RlÌ§. Then equation (A. 17) becomes:
'cr(R*F+R*H)+(l-i (A. 19)
kf~kh 1
Given the dependence of on k in Proposition 2, it is easy to see that the left-hand side decreas range where RlÌ§,RlÌ§ <RC. When A.=0, the value of the left-hand side is finite. As a result, there exist for a >a , there exists a AÌo such that for k < ko condition (A. 19) is met. For a < o, set AÌo =0. We thus have seen that in A. g [0, AÌo] U [AÌi , k*] war occurs for sure and the optimal fiscal investmen 2 indeed characterize the full equilibrium. Suppose now that we are in k e (ko,k'). Here our goal is not mixed-strategy equilibrium but describe how the equilibrium works. In this range, at the fiscal investmen 2, countries have no incentive to go to war. How is an equilibrium determined in this case? Suppose first t the equilibrium probability of war is co=0. In this case, countries go back to the autarky investments ( at these investments no country has an incentive to go to war, then the equilibrium is one where for not occur and country behave as in autarky. It is easy to check that if this is the case, then ko = 0. The by Proposition 2, state-building (and asymmetry among countries) fall in k. As a result, if no ruler fight in autarky, when k = 3/4 Rj^ut, a fortiori no ruler has any incentive to fight for k = 0, for in this la are even more equal. In sum, if w=0, war only arises for k e [k' ,k*]. If instead at the autarky investments either ruler has an incentive to go to war, then in equilibrium th of going to war must be positive. Crucially, since autarky revenues are too high (and unequal) to avert war a positive probability of war (co > 0) reduces state-building in the two countries, much in the spirit o k < 3/4 Rj,aut- From an ex ante standpoint, an overall probability of going to war of 0co induces (accor 2) optimal investments [/?Â£(A.,w),/?JÂ¿(Ã¡,Ãº>)]. The equilibrium is then reached by setting co such that probability of H winning p(Rp(k,co),R1i(k,co)), the party who at autarky revenues is willing to attack between attacking or not (and thus willing to mix with probability co).
B. INSTITUTIONS AND STATE BUILDING
Consider the payoff implications of introducing institutions ttj > 0. Given an amount of fiscal revenues Rj - kj â¢ (Am collected in centralized districts, the total revenue accruing to the central ruler is now equal to Rj = ('- nj) Rj. power holder of a centralized district now obtains 2nj â¢ (Am -Ah) over two periods (which is equal to zero in the abse of institutions). As a result, the loss experienced by a power holder when his district is centralized is now equa 2 [(Ai Ah) Ttj - (Am -Ah)]. The timing of the model is as follows: at the outset, each ruler chooses iij-, next, he sets centralization kj' final military and market interactions occur. To solve the model backwards, note that when, as assumed, nj <nj, one replace Rj with the ruler's effective tax revenue Rj = (1 -ttj) Rj in the maximization problems (4.3) and (4.4). It is th easy to find that the cost for the ruler of raising Rj is equal to:
Cj(Rj) = cj -Rj, where cj = ^ - , (B.l)
Rj,aut
where, in the spirit of equation (3.8), we have:
Rj,au, = (1 -nj,am) min ' f -Ah) â  (Am -Ah)] 4 -AnÌ)l (B.2)
_Bj[(AÂ¡ f -Ah) -nj^au, â  (Am -Ah)] 4
where 7Ty,flMr is the strength of institutions set by the ruler in autarky. Equation (B.2) shows that stronger institutions exert two conflicting effects on Rj^ut (i-e- on the inverse of the cost of centralization), one positive, one negative. As we discussed in the text, the case to consider is the one in which the first, positive effect dominates. Indeed, rulers will never set institutions in the decreasing range. This amounts to restricting

institutions to the case nj ^ it j, where it j is the threshold below which the ruler's revenue increases in t institutions. In this range, stronger institutions can simply be conceptualized as a factor reducing the mar state-building. We assume, without loss of generality, that country H is the low-cost country, namely?// case when H is sufficiently more cohesive than F (i.e., Bh <Bf). Under a linear contest function, and under the assumptions of Point (2-ii) in Proposition 2, the followin
Proposition 4. Denote by nj^ut the equilibrium level of institutional upgrading by ruler J = H, F in a R jaut ande j the associated autarky revenues and marginal cost, respectively. Denote by Kj and nj the equ of centralization and institutions prevailing in country J when an external threat is present (i.e. for all have that :
( 1 ) Institutions and centralization in country J are stronger than in autarky if and only ifX>3-cj/4.
(2) If centralization and institutions are partial, namely Kj < 1 and jtJ <min(lt j,nj) for J = H, F , t country has higher Kj and jtJ than its opponent.
Thus, institutions and centralization improve together as money sensitivity increases, and the more reforms more aggressively, generating divergence.27 Proof The problem of the ruler when choosing how much to centralize is qualitatively identical to th in the absence of institutions, except that now institutions reduce the marginal cost of centralization. As a res centralizes more when X is higher and centralizes more than in autarky when k > 3 -cj/4., where cj is th evaluated at the chosen level of institutions. Accordingly, the higher is A. the higher is the divergence in between the cohesive and the divided country. Consider now the optimal choice of institutions. Because institutions are set before the centralization taken, equations (4.3) and (4.4) imply that the value of institutions nj for the ruler of country J is equal t
