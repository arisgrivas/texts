Abstract
This paper introduces a transparent framework to identify the informational
content of FOMC announcements. We do so by modelling the expectations of the
FOMC and private sector agents using state of the art computational linguistic
tools on both FOMC statements and New York Times articles. We identify the
informational content of FOMC announcements as the projection of high frequency
movements in financial assets onto differences in expectations. Our recovered series
is intuitively reasonable and shows that information disclosure has a significant
impact on the yields of short-term government bonds.

1 Introduction
The identification and macroeconomic impact of monetary policy shocks is a longstand
ing and open question. The key challenge is that monetary policy responds to both
the current and the expected future states of the macroeconomy. Controlling for these
unobserved state variables underlies the main difficulty in identifying the causal impact
of monetary policy. One way to overcome this challenge, is to measure changes in the

prices of financial assets around Central Bank announcements. Under tight time-windows
around Central Bank’s announcements, it is credible to assume that financial markets re
act to said announcements only. However, as stressed by Nakamura and Steinsson [2018]
and Jarocin ́ski and Karadi [2020] among others, these announcements reveal both pol
icy decisions and the central bank’s assessment about the present and future economic
outlook. Consequently, these high-frequency movements in the prices of financial assets
are a response not only to policy decisions but also to the private sector’s updated be
liefs about the state of the economy. Consider the following example of both policy and
private market beliefs around a FOMC meeting.
On September 18, 2007, the FOMC cut the Federal Funds Rate by 50 basis points.
As the New York Times reports, “while an interest rate cut was widely expected, there
had been profound uncertainty about whether the Fed would choose a more cautious
quarter-point reduction. But the bolder action and an accompanying statement, both
approved by a unanimous vote of the central bank’s policy-setting committee, made it
clear that the Fed had decided the risks of a recession were too big to ignore.” Hence, we
see how investors learnt from the aggressive policy decision about the seriously negative
prospects facing the economy.
In order to study the causal effects of monetary policy, we would like to decompose
high-frequency movements into the part which responds to monetary policy (the mone
tary component) and the part which responds to information disclosure by the central
bank (the information or news component). Studying the effect of the monetary compo
nent would allow us to understand the effect of monetary policy, while the information
component allows us to understand how central banks influence the economy beyond
direct policy tools.
In this paper, we use FOMC statements and newspaper articles to identify and quan
tify the information component of monetary policy announcements. We do so via state
of-the art text analysis tools in a framework that is both transparent and highly inter
pretable. Whereas earlier literature has inferred the information component through the
introduction of a structural model (see Nakamura and Steinsson [2018]) or imposing re
strictions on the moments of high-frequency surprises (see Jarocin ́ski and Karadi [2020]),
our method does not impose any assumptions on the relationship between the potential
shocks and macroeconomic variables. Instead, we use text data to model expectations of
the FOMC and the private sector over the Federal Funds Rate (FFR). Our key insight
is that the informational component of monetary policy is the part of high frequency
movements that is correlated with differences in the expectations of the two.
Our method consists of three stages. First, we use tools in computational linguistics
to embed FOMC statements and New York Times articles as numerical vectors. Next,
2


we use the embedded documents to separately model both FOMC and private sector
expectations of the FFR via the elastic net, a transparent method for dealing with high
dimensional data, and which Giannone et al. [2021] advocates for economic data. Here, we
use the expectation of the FOMC to refer to the hypothetical monetary policy rate that
would have been chosen in the absence of monetary policy shocks. Stage two allows us
to construct the differences in expectation about the FFR which arose due to differences
in information alone. Finally, we project high frequency movements of select interest
rates around FOMC announcements onto the differences in expectation and interpret the
projection as the information component of the high frequency movements.
We apply our framework to a set of identified high-frequency movements which the
literature has interpreted as monetary policy shocks. Following Nakamura and Steinsson
[2018] and Jarocin ́ski and Karadi [2020] we decompose these high-frequency movements
into a monetary component and news component. We find that over our sample period
of January 2000 to March 2014, differences in beliefs have predictive power over the high
frequency movement of the Federal Funds Futures around FOMC meetings. We interpret
this finding as evidence that FOMC announcements disclose information about the state
of the economy.
We show that across these different high-frequency movements, the isolated news
component has predictive power over the daily change of short term nominal and real
rates around FOMC meetings. In particular, we argue that not controlling for the news
component of high-frequency surprises may lead to biases on the impact of monetary
policy shocks on domestic financial conditions.
Our contribution to the literature is three-fold. First, we use newspaper text to proxy
for private sector information about monetary policy around FOMC meetings. While text
analysis has been used to study the information effects of FOMC policy announcements,
existing papers have focused on FOMC statements or minutes exclusively (Lucca and
Trebbi [2009], Hansen et al. [2018], Benchimol et al. [2020], Handlan [2020]). We argue
that any informational effects has to operate through differences in expectations, so that
both FOMC and private beliefs must be taken into consideration. Hence we augment our
analysis of FOMC statements with New York Times articles.
Second, we propose a text analysis framework that is interpretable and highly trans
parent. Our framework uses the black-box output of text analysis methods to construct
conditional expectations of various macroeconomic variables. Studying the effects of
these variables – or their differences – on high frequency interest rate movements allows
us to understand the transmission mechanisms of informational effects. Our method is
also highly transparent: the elastic net, which is a form of penalized linear regression,
performs explicit regularization using only two tuning parameters.
3


Third, the empirical applications of our framework shed light on the impact of the
informational content of FOMC announcements on both financial and macroeconomic
variables. Specifically, the news component of high-frequency monetary policy shocks
have a significant impact on short run nominal and real rates, while having little to no
effect on longer maturities. Further studying these shocks can provide insights on the
specific information advantage the Federal Reserve has over private sector agents.
The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data. Section 3 lays out the
text analysis framework in detail. Section 4 provides both qualitative and quantitative
evidence that our procedure recovers informational content. Section 5 concludes.
2 Data
This section of the paper describes the two main types of data used: (i) text coming
from both the Federal Reserve’s FOMC statements and New York Times’ articles; (ii)
high-frequency financial surprises around FOMC announcements.
The sample period is January 2000 to March 2014. The FOMC statement announce
ments were sourced from the Federal Reserve’s website.1 The FOMC statements are short
summaries of the topics discussed by the committee, released following a meeting. This
include the assessment of the current economic situation, and policy decisions regarding
the target federal funds rate, discount rate, and since 2008 different types of unconven
tional monetary policy. In January 2000, the Committee announced that it would issue
a statement following each regularly scheduled meeting, regardless of whether there had
been a change in monetary policy. We drop unscheduled FOMC meetings from our sam
ple as in Nakamura and Steinsson [2018] and Handlan [2020]. In general, an unscheduled
meeting reflects highly unusual economic or political circumstances.
The New York Times’ articles were sourced from Northwestern Library, which granted
us access up to March 2014.2 Our sample consists of articles published on the day of and
day prior to the FOMC meetings. Furthermore we exploit the fact that articles are tagged
by subjects and restrict our sample to only those which contain the subject “federal
reserve”. These articles typically discuss the current economic situations and contain
several private sector projections on both the economy and FOMC policy decisions. Thus,
they provide us with a proxy for private sector expectations on the FOMC announcement
day.
1https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc historical year.htm 2We accessed and downloaded these articles on April 2 2021.
4


We were able to find at least one such article during the day of and the day before
each scheduled FOMC meeting date. This is consistent with the idea that the FOMC
meetings are an important event for the financial markets such that they receive news
coverage in the lead-up.
The empirical section of the paper uses both high-frequency movements in financial
assets and macroeconomic variables for the US. The two high-frequency movements stud
ied are the Fed Funds Futures surprises constructed by Gertler and Karadi [2015] and
the policy news shocks constructed by Nakamura and Steinsson [2018].
We measure the impact of both the isolated monetary and news components using
several daily interest rates. The nominal and real Treasury yields are sourced from
FRED. Data on macroeconomic aggregates, such as the industrial production index and
the consumer price index, are also sourced from FRED.
3 Methodology
This section of the paper details the three-stage process by which we extract the infor
mational component of the high frequency movements around FOMC announcements.
The three-stages can be summarized as follows:
Stage 1: Document Embedding. We use state-of-the-art tools in the fields of natural lan
guage processing and machine learning to convert text documents in numeric vec
tors.
Stage 2: Constructing Proxy Expectations. We use the vector representations from Stage
1 to predict policy decisions of the FOMC. Under a rational expectation assump
tion, we interpret our estimated functions as expected policy decisions given the
information sets of the private sector and the FOMC respectively.
Stage 3: Extracting Informational Content. Suppose market movements around FOMC an
nouncements is due to informational effects. Then these movements should be pro
portional to the difference in expectations. We project high frequency movements
onto the difference in expectation to recover their informational component.
In the following subsections, we provide further details on their implementation, as well
as the assumptions that justify our procedure.

Relative to the literature, the main novelty of our approach is in the use of newspaper
articles to measure public expectation. Whereas the literature has thus far focused on
the FOMC statements alone (see for instance Handlan [2020], Hansen and McMahon
[2016]), we argue below that the information effect should depend on the difference in
the expectations of the public and the FOMC, and that neglecting public expectation
leads to omitted variable bias. In addition, with the exception of stage 1, which relies on
a pre-trained model, the remaining stages involve only simple methods that are highly
transparent. Finally, our method of constructing the intermediate expectation term al
lows us to probe at the mechanism by the information effect operate, as we explore in
section 3.5.
3.1 Stage 1: Document Embedding
In stage 1, we convert each FOMC statement and NYT article in 768 × 1-vectors using
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, Devlin et al. [2019]).
We highlight the challenge of using text data and explain how our BERT overcomes these
problems before detailing our procedure.
Text data is difficult to analyze because of their high-dimensional nature. The sim
plest approach to deal with text is to just treat them as “bag-of-words”. With such an
approach, the analyst would count the number of unique words in each article or docu
ment and then use the word counts as covariates for linear regressions or as input into
other models. However, such an approach would work poorly in our sample, which has
over 8,000 unique words in fewer than 150 observations. Whereas earlier papers have
made progress by choosing which words to include (see for instance Lucca and Trebbi
[2009]), such ad-hoc methods not only have high researcher degree-of-freedom but could
also leave information on the table.
The high dimensionality problem is compounded by the fact that the meanings of
words depend on their context. An FOMC statement that is “worried about inflation not
growth” and one is “worried about growth not inflation” have identical word counts but
express contrary ideas.3 The need to take into account sequential information increases
the dimension of text data exponentially. Consider a simple exercise in which we count
the number of unique 6-word phrases, so that the example phrases above are counted
as distinct entries. In a sample with 8,000 unique words, the possible number of unique
phrases could be as high as 8, 0006 = 2.6 × 1023. It is therefore largely infeasible to work
with counts of phrases alone.
3A more subtle example of this “lexical ambiguity” problem is that “bank” has completely different
meanings in “river bank” and “investment bank”.
6


To render text analysis tractable and effective, we turn to BERT – a state-of-the
art document embedding method that is able to reduce text input into 768 × 1-vectors
while preserving sequential information. Its output captures the meaning of text input
very well, as demonstrated by their usefulness for natural language processing tasks.
For example, models based on BERT excel in question and answering tasks, in which
given a question and a passage from Wikipedia containing the answer, the task is to
predict the answer text span in the passage. Succeeding in these tasks all require some
“understanding” of the text input, giving us assurance that the BERT representations
capture the meaning of words.
The key advantage of using BERT is that it is pre-trained on large amounts of text
data (BooksCorpus – 800M words and English Wikipedia – 2,500M words). Given only
106 observations, it would have been very difficult to train any reasonably flexible text
analysis models. For a similar reason, Handlan [2020] relies on the pre-trained XLNet, a
minor variation of BERT, for their analysis.
We note that other papers have employed Latent Dirichlet Allocations (LDA) models
on samples of similar sizes [all the Hansen and McMahon papers], even though it is
unclear if they are well-behaved given such small samples. In addition, it is known that
LDA models have identification issues so that results are driven by the choice of priors
even asymptotically (Ke et al. [2021]). Hence, we consider them to be unsuitable for the
task at hand.
We initialized pretrained BERT models from an open source implementation provided
by Hugging Face.4 (https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) To use BERT, we first
cleaned the input data by removing numbers, dates as well as common stop-words. Stop
words are a set of words which do not contain information about the content of the
articles, such as prepositions and conjunctions. Removing these words “enriches” the
information content in text articles. Here, we relied on the stop-word list compiled by
the text analysis package gensim. Next, the words were tokenized. A token is the most
fundamental object in a chosen language dictionary (it could be a word, character, or
subword). We used the default tokenizer provided by Hugging Face for use with the
bert-base-uncased model for tokenization.
Finally, we split each individual document into windows of 256 tokens, with overlaps of
10 tokens between windows. Each window is tokenized separately, and passed through the
BERT model to form individual outputs. The embedding vector of the entire document is
then taken to be the mean of the BERT class tokens across all of the windowed outputs.
4Hugging Face is a large open-source community that hosts pre-trained deep learning models, mainly
aimed at NLP. Their state-of-the-art transformer models are used by Google, Facebook, Microsoft and
AWS
7


We note that the cleaning process removes all numbers from the text. Consequently,
the actual policy decisions as well as numerical projections about the economy are absent
from the documents. This gives us assurance that our method is not simply picking up
the policy rates or their forecasts, but rather capturing beliefs about the economy.
3.2 Stage 2: Constructing Proxy Expectations
In the second stage, we use the document embeddings to construct proxy expectations
for the general public and the FOMC. Our starting point is the equations:
FFRt = f NYT(XNYT
t ) + εNYT
t
FFRt = f FOMC(XFOMC
t ) + εFOMC
t
where XNYT
t and XFOMC
t are the embeddings of NYT articles and FOMC statement at
time t. We further assume that
E
[εNYT
t
∣
∣ XNYT
t
] = 0 , E [εFOMC
t
∣
∣ X FOMC
t
] = 0 . (1)
We interpret the above assumption as follows. Suppose XNYT
t captures all information
about the economy that is available to the general public at time t. Then public expec
tation about FFR is given by
f NYT(X NYT
t ) = E [FFRt
∣
∣ XNYT
t
].
The conditional mean assumption
E
[εNYT
t
∣
∣ XNYT
t
]=0
is thus a rational expectation assumption – the general public has beliefs that are not
systematically biased and are correct on average.
We assume the same is true for the FOMC. That is, we assume that XFOMC
t contains
all the information that the FOMC has about the economy at time t. f FOMC(XFOMC
t ) is
then the Taylor rule that maps FOMC information into interest rate decisions. εFOMC
t is
monetary policy shock – implementation error that prevents the FOMC from achieving
its desired optimal policy rate. We assume that this monetary policy shock is 0 on
average and mean independent from XFOMC
t . This is consistent with the current views
on monetary policy shock, as discussed in Ramey [2016].
Given our limited sample size, we impose further structure for estimation by assuming
that f NYT and f FOMC take the following linear form:
f NYT(X NYT
t ) = αNYT + βNYT′X NYT
t
f NYT(X NYT
t ) = αFOMC + βFOMC′X FOMC
t
8


Because we use the pre-trained BERT, XNYT
t , X FOMC
t ∈ R768. In order to estimate α and
β from our sample of size 106, we use the elastic net, defined as:
(βˆNYT, αˆNYT)
= arg min
β,α
∥
∥FFR − α − β′XNYT∥
∥
2
2+γη (‖α‖1 + ‖β‖1)+γ(1−η) (‖α‖2
2 + ‖β‖2
2
)
(βˆFOMC, αˆFOMC)
= arg min
β,α
∥
∥FFR − α − β′XFOMC∥
∥
2
2+γη (‖α‖1 + ‖β‖1)+γ(1−η) (‖α‖2
2 + ‖β‖2
2
)
Here, FFR, XNYT and XFOMC refer to the stacked matrices of FFRt, XNYT
t and XFOMC
t
respectively.
The elastic net nests two popular methods of penalized regressions. Suppose η = 1.
Then the elastic net reduces to the LASSO estimator. LASSO performs model selection
by setting regression coefficients to zero. The resulting output is typically an interpretable
model in which only a few coefficients are non-zero. On the other hand, setting η = 0
leads to the ridge estimator, a dense model which assigns highly correlated regressors
similar coefficients. Since the elastic net is more general, it is able to achieve better
prediction accuracy given properly chosen tuning parameters (Zou and Hastie [2005]).
Furthermore, it has a Bayesian interpretation as the posterior mode induced by the
spike-and-slab prior of Mitchell and Beauchamp [1988] and may be more appropriate for
economic data (Giannone et al. [2021]).
With our conditional mean assumptions, the elastic net is L2 consistent as long as the
space of the covariates is sufficiently rich (De Mol et al. [2009]). Since we are interested
in prediction and not model selection, we do not require any sparsity assumption.
Each elastic net requires two tuning parameters (λ, η). Because these parameters are
chosen to maximize R2 in stage 3, we discuss their selection in the next subsection.
3.3 Stage 3: Extracting Informational Content
In this subsection, we explain how we use the proxy expectations from stage 2 to decom
pose high frequency movements of interest rates around FOMC announcements into an
information and a monetary component.
Let ∆Rt denote the high frequency movement of interest rate R around the release of
FOMC statements. Suppose ∆Rt includes reaction by the private sector to information
released by the Federal Reserve. This component should be a function to the difference
in information of the two parties. In particular, if there is no difference in information,
this component should be 0. This motivates the following linear regression:
∆Rt = ζ + θ∆E[FFRt] + νt , E [νt | ∆E[FFRt]] = 0, (2)
9


where
∆E[FFRt] := αFOMC + βFOMC′XFOMC
t − αNYT + βNYT′X NYT
is the difference in the expectations of the private sector and the FOMC based solely on
difference in information.
For any choice of tuning parameters (λ, η) in stage 2, we are able to construct
̂
∆E[FFRt] := αˆFOMC + βˆFOMC′XFOMC
t − αˆNYT + βˆNYT′XNYT .
We then choose our tuning parameter to maximise R2 in the regression of ∆Rt on ̂
∆E[FFRt], where the latter term is a function of (λ, η).
The regression in equation (2) has clear meaning. Here, we are projecting the high
frequency movement onto the differences in proxy expectation and we interpret the pro
jected component as the part of ∆Rt that is responding to Federal Reserve information.
Suppose we were able exactly capture news component of ∆Rt. We would then be
able to interpret the residual in the above regression as true monetary policy shocks.
However, we are cautious that much of the news component may remain due in part to
the restrictive linear assumption in equation (2). On the other hand, given the sample
size of 106, it is unclear if more flexible functional forms would simply lead to over-fitting.
For this reason, the simple linear regression is our preferred specification for stage 3.
An approach commonly seen in the literature (see for instance Handlan [2020], Hansen
and McMahon [2016]) is to run the regression on the FOMC component only:
∆Rt = ζ + θ · f FOMC(XFOMC
t ) + ξt (3)
As we argued above, the informational component of the high frequency movement should
depend on the difference in information, and not the level directly. Suppose equation 2
is true. We can rewrite equation 3 as
∆Rt = ζ + θ · f FOMC(XFOMC
t ) − θ · f NYT(XNYT
t ) + νt , E [νt |XFOMC
t
] = 0.
Here,
ξt = −θ · f NYT(XNYT
t ) + νt
is clearly correlated with f FOMC(XFOMC
t ) through f NYT(XNYT
t ), giving rise to omitted
variable bias.
Furthermore, equation (2) is robust in that it can be valid even when the conditions in
equation (1) is violated. For example, suppose the FOMC has time varying preferences
in trading off inflation and output gap, so that a positive shock is more likely when
the FOMC preferences have a hawkish realization. This violates the conditional mean
10


assumption in equation (3) as long as the statements contains information about its
current hawkishness. However, time-varying preferences, or other omitted variables, do
not cause a problem for the regression in (2) as long as:
Cov (νt, f FOMC(XFOMC
t )) = Cov (νt, f NYT(XNYT
t )) .
Intuitively, our regression is valid as long as these omitted variables skew private sector
and FOMC expectations the same way. On the other hand, if equation (1) does not hold,
3 will be invalid, even if XFOMC
t ⊥⊥ XNYT
t.
Finally, even if XFOMC
t ⊥⊥ XNYT
t , our specification will still have more power. Includ
ing f NYT(XNYT
t ) would lead to more precise estimates by reducing the variance of the
residuals. This gels with the idea that our regression is a more direct test of the infor
mation hypothesis: if the high frequency movement is driven by agents updating their
information set, theory directly predicts that these movement should be proportional to
the amount of updating that occurred.
Next, we provide intuitive reasons for choosing tuning parameters that maximize R2
in stage 3. Firstly, the tuning parameters that are chosen are unlikely to overfit the
stage 2 elastic nets. To see this, observe that if we overfit stage 2 to the extreme, such
that αˆFOMC + βˆFOMC′XFOMC
t = αˆNYT + βˆNYT′XNYT
t = FFRt. Then ̂
∆E[FFRt] = 0
identically so that stage 3 R2 is 0. It is equally unlikely to underfit stage 2. Consider
again the extreme case, this time in which βˆNYT and βˆFOMC are set to 0. Now, αˆNYT =
αˆFOMC = 1
T
∑T
t=1 FFRt so that ̂
∆E[FFRt] is again 0. Our procedure guards against both
of these problems. Where the method may face issues is in overfitting stage 3. However,
we believe that this is less of a concern since stage 3 is a linear regression with only two
parameters.

Summary statistics for Stage 3 of our procedure is presented in table 1. We find
11


evidence that high frequency movements around FOMC announcements is in part a
response to information from the Federal Reserve. In particular, we note βˆ is positive
for PNS, FFR and FF4. It is also significant at the 5% level for the PNS and FF4 in
the pre-ZLB period, and for FF4 in the full sample. The positive sign implies that when
the information set of the FOMC leads it to set higher interest rate than the public was
expecting, the market response is positive.
The R2 in stage 3 is relatively low across the board. This could be interpreted as
meaning that most of the movement around FOMC announcements is response to pure
monetary policy shock. On the other hand, given the our highly restrictive linear model in
stage 3, we consider the information effect we found to be a lower bound: with more data
and a more flexible stage 3, we might find potentially much larger information effects.

Table 2 presents summary statistics associated with stage 2, including the tuning
parameters chosen by our procedure. Larger η implies that the chosen model is closer to
a LASSO, while smaller η implies that the chosen model is closer to a ridge regression.
We see evidence for sparsity in PNS and FF4 with the FOMC statement, especially in
the full sample period, since the preferred model is the LASSO. This suggests that there
are only a few variables which are important for determining the FOMC’s desired policy
rate. On the other hand, during the pre-ZLB period, the selected models tended towards
ridge regressions, suggesting that there are more diverse considerations for determining
interest rates prior to the Great Financial Crisis.
We note that R2 is high in the full sample, but much smaller in the the pre-ZLB
sample. This is likely because FFR remained largely constant after the Great Financial
Crisis. Taking the model at face value, we would infer that monetary policy is easier to
predict after post-crisis, and that the variance of monetary policy shocks is smaller. On
the other hand, we are cautious that our linear model may be inappropriate for modelling
the policy rates, which may be censored at the zero lower bound.
We conclude by noting that our approach is highly transparent. All tuning parameters
as well as regression parameters that we chose are contained in tables 1 and 2. The only
12


unpresented parameters belong to BERT, which is trained by an external party without
reference to any of the variables used in stage 2 and 3.
3.5 Channels of Information Transmission
In order to understand how new information from the FOMC translates to market reac
tion, we consider how differences in expectation of specific macroeconomic variables drive
high frequency movements around FOMC announcements. To do that, we extend the
analysis thus far to a general economic variable Yi:
Yi,t = f NYT
i (X NYT
t ) + εNYT
i,t
Yi,t = f FOMC
i (X FOMC
t ) + εFOMC
i,t
where as before we assume that:
E
[εNYT
i,t
∣
∣ XNYT
t
] = 0 , E [εFOMC
i,t
∣
∣ X FOMC
t
]=0.
However, the stage 3 equation of interest is
∆Rt = ζ +
p
∑
i=1
θi · ∆E[Yi,t] + νt , E [νt | ∆E[Yt]] = 0. (4)
Suppose Yi,t = πt is inflation at πt. In the regression above, we would then interpret θi
as the high frequency movement that resulted from differences in inflation expectation.
Running regression 4 allows us to understand what type of informational differences is
driving the high frequency movement.
In particular, let Y1,t be real GDP in the next nearest quarter and Y2,t be CPI in the
next nearest month.5 These are the two variables that would be relevant if interest rate
was set according to a simple Taylor rule. Results are presented in table 3. Across the
board, when the FOMC expects higher inflation than the private sector, the interest rates
increase following the announcements. This is in line with the predictions of standard
macroeconomic theory, in which the central bank raises rates in response to heightened
inflationary pressures regardless of whether the source is demand or supply shocks.
The coefficients on real GDP is mixed. In the pre-ZLB period, the coefficients on real
GDP have positive signs across the board. In words, when the FOMC expects higher real
GDP than the public, interest rates subsequently increases. In the full sample, however,
the sign changes to negative for FFR and FF4. Standard macroeconomic theory does

choice is motivated by the FOMC targetting a core inflation rate which excludes commodity prices such
as Food and Energy which are highly influenced by international markets.

not provide a straightforward answer to how monetary authority should react to GDP
fluctuations. For instance, if the central bank receive news of a positive demand shock,
then it raises its GDP projections and simultaneously raises interest rates. This gives rise
to a positive comovement between expected GDP and monetary rate policy. But, if it
receives news of a negative supply shock, a central bank would raise rates even as it lowers
GDP projections, leading to negative comovements. Note that the full sample includes
episodes of supply-side shocks such as tax cuts and/or oil price shocks; and furthermore,
we exclude observations from July 2008 to July 2009 inclusive. Hence, it is plausible that
in our full sample supply shocks play a large role.
In sum, our method allows us to probe at the mechanisms of information transmission.
We find that when the FOMC expects higher inflation than the private sector, interest
rates unequivocally increase. However, when the FOMC expects higher real GDP than
the private sector, interest rate movements are mixed. These patterns are suggestive of
the types of shocks in an economy.

4 Evidence of Informational Content
In this section, we provide evidence that the component we isolated using the procedure
in Section 3 carries informational content. We focus on event study and financial market
evidence.6
6In Appendix A we present additional evidence by estimating the impact of “Monetaryt” at the
aggregate level using a SVAR model. Expectedly, these are not too different from SVARs using the high
frequency shocks alone, given the R2 of Stage 3.

4.1 Event Study Analysis
We study the components of the high-frequency financial surprises isolated in the previous
section. Given the modest R2 from the decomposition, it is unsurprising that the news

we omit observations between July 2008 to July 2009 inclusive.
component has relatively smaller variance than the monetary component. However, the
series is intuitively reasonable. To show this, we zoom in on three FOMC announcements
in which the news component was thought to have played an important role ex post.
September 18, 2007: We return to our opening example on which the FOMC cut
its rates by 50 basis points. As our quoted text suggests, the market interpreted
the Federal Reserve’s fairly aggressive actions and statements to mean that a sharp
economic downturn was imminent. Thus it is reassuring that we recorded one of
our largest negative news shock on this date.
March 18, 2008: One of our larger positive news shock was documented on March
18, 2008, even amidst the Great Financial Crisis. On this day, the FOMC cut rates
by 75 basis points to 2.25 percent. However, as the New York Times reports,
“though it was one of the biggest one-day rate cuts in decades, investors had been
betting heavily that the Fed would cut its key rate a full percentage point in response
to strong evidence that a recession has begun and to the deepening crisis on Wall
Street.” Instead, the Federal Reserve policy reflected concerns about inflation. As
the FOMC statement writes, “inflation has been elevated, and some indicators of
15


inflation expectations have risen”. It is therefore reassuring that our measure of
news recorded a positive value, reflecting the Federal Reserve’s information about
inflation.
January 30, 2002: Another of our largest positive surprises came as the economy
was recovering from the bursting of the dot-com bubble and 9-11. At this meeting,
the FOMC left interest rates unchanged, which was a departure from its yearlong
policy of rate cuts. According to the FOMC, “Signs that weakness in demand is
abating and economic activity is beginning to firm have become more prevalent”.
As the New York Times reports, “Investors interpreted [...] the Fed’s decision
on interest rates as signs that the economy might be stabilizing. Stocks prices
moved higher in the afternoon after the Fed’s announcement.” Here, we have explicit
indication that investors interpreted the Federal Reserve’s policy as good news,
supporting the positive news shock that we recovered.
4.2 Financial Market Evidence
The goal of this subsection of the paper is to identify the effect of the informational content
of FOMC announcements on nominal and real interest rates of different maturities.
First, we measure the impact of the informational content of FOMC announcements
on nominal and real interest rates. In particular, we estimate the following two empirical
equations
∆rt = α0 + β∆Rt + et (5)
∆rt = α1 + γMonetaryt + μNewst + t (6)
were ∆rt is the change in the outcome nominal and/or real interest rate of interest, e.g.,
the Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant Maturity; ∆Rt is the
high-frequency financial surprise around the FOMC announcement; Monetaryt and Newst
are the decomposition coming from the methodology used in Section 3; et and t are error
terms; and α0, α1, β, γ and μ are parameters. The parameter of interests are β, γ and
μ. Comparing β and γ allows us to identify how purging the high-frequency surprises of
informational content changes the impact of monetary policy shocks on nominal and real
interest rates.
First, we study the impact of the high-frequency Fed Funds Futures on nominal and
real rates by estimating Equation 5 using the high-frequency surprise FF4. Table 4
presents the results of this regressions. Column (1) presents the empirical estimates of
coefficient β in Equation 5 for different nominal and real rates. Results seem to show a
hump-shaped impact of FF4t on nominal rates, with no significant impact on the three

month nominal rate, a positive impact on nominal rates at the one to 10 year maturities
(peaking at 2 years), and no impact on long-term rates. Surprisingly, there does not seem
to be a significant impact of FF4t on the daily change of real interest rates captured by
TIPS.7
Next, we turn to estimating the impact of the different isolated components of FF4t
estimated in Section 3. Columns (2) and (3) present empirical estimates of coefficients
γ and μ in Equation 6, respectively, for different nominal and real interest rates. Inter
estingly, while the ”Monetaryt” component of FF4t does not seem to have a significant

statements in the year 2000 and the data availability of text, we have a short sample. This problem

effect on the 3-month maturity treasury, the ”Newst” component has a significant impact
on this short run interest rate. The ”Newst” component does not seem to have significant
impact on mid and long-term treasury yields. Consequently, the estimated coefficients
of the ”Monetaryt” component is similar to the coefficients presented in Column (1) for
FF4t.
Second, we estimate the impact of the ”Policy News Shocks” or PNSt constructed
by Nakamura and Steinsson [2018] and its decomposition on nominal and real interest
rates. Note, this policy indicator is comprised of changes in multiple nominal interest
rates at different maturities spanning the first year of the term structure.8 A priori, this
could imply greater variability of PNSt, compared to FF4t. Additionally, in Nakamura
and Steinsson [2018] the authors stress that this composite policy indicator captures
the effects of “forward guidance” (FOMC announcements that convey information about
future changes in the Fed Funds rate). Column (1) of Table 5 presents the empirical
estimates of coefficient β in Equation 5. While results are in line with those for FF4t,
the estimates are highly more significant. Again, we find that the empirical estimates
for β exhibits a hump-shaped impact on nominal interest rate across the term structure.
Unlike the results presented in 4, the policy news shock has a significant impact on TIPS
yields up to the 10 year maturity rate.
Finally, we turn to estimating the role of the ”Monetaryt” and ”Newst” components
of Policy New Shocks. Once more, the ”Newst” component has a large and significant
impact on short term nominal interest rates. One way to quantify the relevance of the
news component is comparing the estimated coefficients for the ”Monetaryt” component
and those for PNSt. Not controlling for the news component biases up the impact on
nominal interest rate between 10 and 5 basis points for short term nominal interest rate,
and biases the impact down between 15 and 30 basis points for mid and long term nominal
interest rates. In addition, the impact of ”Monetaryt” on TIPS real rates is greater than
the impact of PNSt. Interestingly, the news component which has a large and significant
impact on short run nominal interest rate, also seems to have a large but negative impact
on long run real rates.
In summary, the paragraphs above studied the impact of high-frequency financial
surprises and its decomposition on the daily change of nominal and real rates around
FOMC meetings. We find that the news component of these high-frequency surprises
has a significant impact on short term nominal interest rates across different specified
shocks. We take these results as evidence that differences in the expected policy rate by

change over the 30-minute windows in the following five interest rates: the Fed funds rate immediately
following the FOMC meeting, the expected Fed funds rate immediately following the next FOMC meet

the FOMC Statements and the New York Times has a systematic and persistent impact
on relevant financial rates.
5 Conclusion
We argue that FOMC announcements contain both information and monetary policy
content. We develop a transparent framework to pick out the informational content of
high-frequency financial surprises around FOMC announcements by using state-of-the
art text analysis on both policy statements and newspapers.
19


We find that differences in expectations about policy rates between the FOMC and
private agents are predictive of high-frequency movements around policy announcements.
Furthermore, we show that the isolated informational content has a significant impact
on the yields of short-term government bonds. Consequently, ignoring this informational
content may bias our understanding of the impact of monetary policy shocks.
We interpret these findings as an existence result. In order to draw reasonable con
clusions from a small dataset, we have prioritized simplicity and transparency over more
flexible functional forms. Hence, we consider our estimates to be lower bounds for the
informational content in FOMC announcements.

A SVAR Evidence
In this Appendix we provide evidence of the informational content in high frequency
financial surprises by introducing their isolated components into a SVAR model. In
particular, we will focus on estimating the impact of monetary component of the isolated
shocks on aggregate variables.
The most general specification of the SVAR model has n endogenous variables, p lags,
and m exogenous variables which can be written in compact form as
yt = A1yt−1 + . . . + Apyt−p + Cxt + t (7)
where yt = (y1,t, . . . , yn,t) is an n×1 vector of endogenous variables; A1, . . . , Ap are p n×n
matrices; C is a n × m matrix. The time frequency of the estimated model is monthly.
Consequently, we choose the vector yt to be comprised of three variables: the industrial
production growth rate, the consumer price index inflation and the excess bond premium
or EBP (see Gilchrist and Zakrajsˇek [2012]). This specification is in line with other em
pirical models estimated in the literature (see Gertler and Karadi [2015] and Jaroci ́nski
and Karadi [2020]. In terms of the exogenous vector of variables mt, it will be comprised
of the ”Monetaryt” component of the shocks deconstructed in Section 3. We consider
both the isolated component of FF4t and the PNSt shocks. We focus on the impact of
the ”Monetaryt” component as the ”Newst” component does not have a straightforward
interpretation for all cases, as stressed in previous sections. Thus, We center our atten
tion on estimating the impact of the component of high-frequency surprises which can
not be attributed to differences in expectations between policymakers and the private
sector. The model is estimated using Bayesian techniques using a Minnesota prior over
its parameters.
Figures 2 and 3 present the results of this exercise for the FF4t and PNSt shocks
respectively. The different shades reflect the 66% and 90% confidence intervals. Across
the two shocks, we observe that a one standard deviation increase in the Monetaryt
component of the fundamental shocks lead to a drop in the growth rate of industrial
production and inflation, and tighter private sector financial conditions. However, the
results are statistically different from zero for the FF4t shock while the results for the PNSt
shock are less clear. This could be due to the PNSt having a stronger news component,
as seen for its impact on daily rates in the previous subsection. Consequently, if the
methodology presented in Section 3 does not capture the entirety of the informational
content, it could be biasing these IRF results.
