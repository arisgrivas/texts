COMMERCE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL:
CENTRES, CIRCUITS, RESOURCES

ommerce refers to exchange - to the circulation or mobilisation of goods, people and messages. It embraces three territorial concepts. One territory is a concentration of points within which the human inhab itants produce goods and messages, reproduce themselves and transform to some degree the goods and messages produced by the members of their own group. A second kind of territory is a concentration of points or markets and towns to which goods, labour skills and talents are brought for direct consumption or for exchange with middlemen. The middle men in turn organise the movement of some of the goods, messages and talents produced and transformed in the first two types of territory by means of a third form, namely a linear succession of clearly designated points of land or sea (and ultimately air) called routes, or by means of other networks of communication, to another group of territories similarly organised along tripartite spatial principles but possessing a different set of natural and cultural endowments, realisations, political authorities and often a different set of belief systems, but in which a strong demand exists or can be created for the particular goods, messages, labour or special talents (capital) that the intermediaries can provide. The same or other intermediaries may facilitate the movement of other goods, people and messages - along other or along the same roads, routes and networks of communication - to the first system of tripartite territorial organisation or to other systems in which a demand may exist for the goods, messages, or labour and talents Of the second system.

1. Resource base of the Atlantic-European circuit of communication
Spatial organisation In the Old World, there were in place by the and the world 13th century, according to Janet Abu-Lughod, economies eight world systems of tripartite spatial organi sation.* In each such world circuit of commu nication or exchange, or world economy, a different set of intermediaries played the role of linking that system to one or more of the others. The two systems in which Greeks played an important role as intermediaries during part of the period between the 15th century and 1900 were the western Asian/eastern Mediterranean world economy in its Ottoman form and the European or Atlantic-European world economy, the system that ultimately became the basis for a single world economy. The Hungarian historian Zsigmond Pdl Pach has identified, however, two forms of long distance trade, each governed by different principles - an ‘old’ or, in a European context, a ‘medieval’ form, and a ‘modern’ form. The old form ‘did not imply an exchange of goods produced by the European economy.’ It ‘mostly dealt in oriental spices and luxury articles, supplying Levant commodities to European markets in order to satisfy the luxury demands of the upper-class (and rich burgher) consumers.’ Its basis was not in goods it possessed but in goods it lacked and for which there was a crav ing among members of some of its social groups. The ‘modern’ form represented an intensified craving for things. The new desires had to be backed, however, by the ability to provide raw materials that Europe itself did not possess but obtained from a second area in which they created a labour force made up both of their own ‘colonies’ (in the literal sense of cultivators) and by forced population transfers from a third area. Under the impulse of desires communicated to larger segments of its population, ; Europe transformed the imported raw materials into manufactures, a j portion of which, by the exercise of power and mercantile ingenuity, its j mediators were able to place in other markets. j The transformation, writes Pach, was the product of ‘the economic ; growth of Europe... [of] the advancement of commodity production... [of] progress in the social division of labour... which provided increas ing quantities of mass-consumption goods (and industrial raw materials)
to steadily widening buyers’ markets’^. John C.H. Fei and Gustav Ranis identify the achievement with the pursuit by the European states of ‘mer cantile agrarianism’ - increasing the quantity and variety of agricultural products, protecting their own manufactures and exporting a portion in
404___________ GREEK ECONOMIC HISTORY OF THE 15TH TO 19TH CENTURIES rnlUMERCE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL 405
exchange for more raw materials with which to make more manufactured ods.® The ultimate consequence of that policy was to break down the coinpartmentalisation of the eight separate albeit linearly linked world economies and enable the newest of the world economies, the one-time geographically marginal European or Atlantic-European world economy, to infiltrate and later peripheralise the others. Eco-feminists have suggested that the goal of economic growth impelled the European societies to lust after more and more things, including natural resources, as they discovered half a world that they previously had not known. This discovery may have triggered in turn the diffusion of a mechanistic view of nature as something to be molded to man’s - and particularly men’s - will, and especially to the will of those men who were most ready to exploit the world’s resources most energetically and to shift them around, so that a larger share of the world’s utilisable energy became available to those individuals and political, economic and social groups who reveled in their own individual, male, racial, cultural, national, organisational, and/or geopolitical superiority.^
Metropolis A continuation of the maritime wars of the 16th cen
and colonies tury, the major wars of the European states in the 18th
century had as their aim to obtain for one of the states an assured access to raw materials and an outlet to foreign markets for its own raw materials and manufactures by controlling the seas, by obtain ing access to the sea and denying its access to others, and - in the Americas - by establishing an exclusive relationship between metropolis (mother city) and colony, whereby the colony allocated its treasures and surplus products to the metropolis while the metropolis provisioned the colony with manufactures and other needed and desired goods, including slaves and indentured labour. As late as 1600, the annual European consumption of Asian goods exclusive of goods of Ottoman production probably did not exceed 7,000 metric tons, half of which still reached Europe by way of land caravans.^ This amount was only slightly more than the exports in 1875 of the small Ottoman (since 1912, Greek) port of Kavala. A real difference did exist, however, in the nature of the products. The Asian exports were relatively high-cost raw silk, silks, pepper, other spices and indigo. The exports of Kavala were low-cost or high-consumption products; tobacco, barley, wheat, rye, maize (which was imported in yet greater quantities) and cotton.® The (West) Indies trade rose from 3,000 metric tons in the early decades of the 16th century to 15,000 in the 1560s and to 25,000-30,000


406 GREEK ECONOMIC HISTORY OF THE 15TH TO 19TH CENTURIES
in the 1580s7 It was still quantitatively less than the international trade of the Ottoman Empire. Toward the end of the 17th and the early part of the 18th century, however, the relationship was reversed. One of the competing European powers, England, built a superior navy. Between 1689 and 1702 and again between 1714 and 1748, it obtained from Spain both the right to the tax farm (asiento) of the African slave trade, in this way becoming the main supplier of slaves for the Spanish colonies, and the right to station a ship at Porto Bello. Abusively replen ishing this ship with goods from other ships, England became the chief non-Spanish source of goods for the Spanish colonies. Later it obtained the right to establish ports of trade in the Gulf of Honduras, from which it obtained dye woods and engaged in coastal contraband trade.® In 1748 and more fully after the Seven Years’ War, relations between the metropolis and the colonies were slightly but significantly modified. The practice of tax-farming, notably its direct practice in a European colony by a foreign European state, came under attack, and private for eign trade by the colqnies was authorised. As a result, between 1764 and 1774 the value of goods sent from Cuba to Spain tripled, that from other parts of Spanish America to Spain doubled.® In effect, the object of the change or rationalisation was to make more raw materials available to the metropolis. John H. Clapham and Rondo Cameron contend, in fact, that one of the reasons for the occurrence of the so-called ‘industrial revolution’ in England rather than in France may have been France’s relative poverty in critical raw materials. Behind this lack, contends David Landes, lay the facts of inadequate macro-decisions, conflicting decision centres, and a consequent inability to institute a spatial organisation conducive to making macro-decisions that may have allowed France to obtain needed raw materials in sufficient quantity and quality from other parts of the world.'® Different world areas were diversely affected by access or lack of direct access to the raw materials and treasures of the New World and by the transformation of the relationships between each of the other seven Old World economies and the European-Atlantic economy. The role of par ticular staples as export products in shaping the economy of regions with abundant natural resources and low demographic density, and without the great diversity of political and historical experience that characterises regions of high demographic density, is well known." Our task, however, will be to explain the relationship between the resource base of the Otto man circuit of communication and exchange and the resource base of
the European-Atlantic circuit, as well as the foie of the Greek and other commercial diasporas in the Ottoman world economy while the Euro pean-Atlantic world economy grew in power, authority and. extent.
The wealth-producing There was long a bottleneck to regular base and international economic growth in all the world econotrade ■ mies. In Europe, the bottleneck was the food, linen, flax, wool, hemp, fur, fuel, timber, and leather supply. If more flax was grown, if more sheep were raised, if more land was devoted to forest cover, less land would be avail able for cereal cultivation. Only in the 18th century did this obstacle begin to be overcome. All that European economic growth had been able to achieve until that time was to reach a level that had been reached earlier in some of the other world economies. One way by which Europe vanquished that obstacle was by improv ing its methods of agriculture, horticulture and stockraising - by the application of science to production and technology. To a greater degree, however, it overcame the impediment by obtaining access to a preponder ant proportion of the world’s supply of raw materials. One may situate that achievement between 1750 and 1850.
Raw materials: By the 1850s, one of the European states, the United cotton Kingdom, having become both the foremost eco nomic and the leading political power in the world, was the beneficiary of 25-75% of world imports of several key raw mate rials that were needed to promote manufactures designed to satisfy the clothing requirements of the world: 3/4 of the international commerce in raw cotton, 3/5 of the international commerce in hemp (imported in large measure from Russia, especially the Baltic area), almost half the interna tional commerce in jute, a quarter of the international commerce in wool, and a quarter of the international commerce in raw silk.
Three factors made this triumph possible: Britain’s mobilisation of the textile resources of the world in order to promote its own manufactures, its possession of easily exploitable coal as an energy resource with which to mobilise its textile and other manufactures, and its military and politi cal victory over its rival, France. Raw material imports show a continuing consolidation of Britain’s triumph between 1821 and 1859. One of the raw materials about which we are fairly well informed is cotton. France’s imports of raw cotton (either as such or as cotton yarn), for exam ple, grew from almost 1,000 metric tons in 1688 to 2,200 or even well over
rnMMERCE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL______________________________ 407


408 GREEK ECONOMIC HISTORY OF THE 15TH TO 19TH CENTURIES
3,000 metric tons in 1750, an average of 5,000 metric tons (raw cotton only, without the raw cotton that was employed to produce the imports of cotton yarn) between 1787 and 1789 - an amount that was probably not exceeded until after 1802, representing imports during the French revolutionary wars mostly of raw cotton from Brazil by way of Lisbon - and an average of close to 10,000 metric tons (again, raw cotton only) during the Napoleonic era. French imports of raw cotton for home consumption (imports minus re-exports) rose from an average of almost 16,000 metric tons between 1816 and 1820 to 30,000 between 1826 and 1830, almost 47,000 between 1836 and 1840, and almost 56,000 between 1846 and 1850. English imports of raw cotton did not exceed 1,000 metric tons until 1741. Rising to just over 2,000 metric tons between 1771 and 1775, they grew to 5,000 metric tons between 1781 and 1785, to more than 9,000 metric tons in 1786 and more than 25,000 metric tons between 1801 and 1805. British imports of this raw material totaled 60,000 metric tons in 1810, over 30,000 in 1812, almost 69,000 in 1820, almost 120,000 in 1830, more than 264,000 in 1840 and almost 306,000 metric tons in 1850. Of these imports, 39,000 metric tons were for home consumption in 1810, 59,000 in 1820, 111,000 in 1830, 213,000 in 1840, and 265,000 in 1850.
Between the 1780s and 1840, however, the sources of cotton supply changed radically. In 1786, for example, England obtained 29% of its raw cotton imports from its West Indian possessions, 28% from the French and Spanish colonies, 10% from the Portuguese colonies, 8% from the Dutch colonies, and 25% from the Ottoman Empire - mostly from Smyrna. In 1831, the United Kingdom imported 131,000 metric tons of raw cotton: 89,000 or 68.3% from the United States, 15,000 metric tons or 11.1% from Brazil, 12,000 metric tons or 8.9% from the East Indies, over 3,000 metric

tons or 2.3% from Egypt, some 10,0000 metric tons or 7.9% from countries unidentified, but only 161 metric tons or 0.1% from Turkey and Greece. France’s imports of Ottoman cotton fell from 12.4% (2,900 metric tons) of its cotton imports between 1821 and 1825 to 3.8% (1,100 metric tons) between 1831 and 1835. World cotton production for export by the mid-1830s amounted to 230,000 metric tons. Of that amount, 175,000 metric tons were produced in the United States, 30,000 in India, 12,000 in Brazil, 10,000 in Egypt and

the Levant and 3,000, in the French colonies, especially Cayenne and Bour bon Island (Reunion). Of the world’s raw cotton destined for export, 150,000 metric tons went to Britain, 40,000 to France, and 17,000 to Switzerland, Saxony, Prussia and Belgium*^. A quarter century later, three times as much raw cotton entered the international export market. The world production and export of cotton by the latter part of the 1850s, without the production of Europe, was as presented in table 8.2. ■ The estimate of exports of raw cotton from India to China may be too low. For the average annual export to China between 1824 and 1830 was 7,004 metric tons from Calcutta and 19,500 metric tons from the presidency of Bombay.*^ Some estimates also would raise the total world cotton produc tion to 2.2 million metric tons.
Of a total world production of 1.9-2.2 million metric tons, more than 0.8 million tons represented exports to Europe.*^ As late as 1740, on the other hand, Europe’s imports of raw cotton probably did not exceed 40,000 metric tons. But more than 25% of that amount came from the Ottoman Empire, and 15% of Europe’s imports came from the European territories of the Empire, which were hardly important at all as a cotton exporting area until 1740 or 1750.
Coffee Another product of growing importance in world trade was coffee. Around 1685, coffee exports from Yemen, by way of the Red Sea to Cairo, may have amounted to 3,750 metric tons. The caravans of camels from Medina carried northward another 2,250 metric tons, of which 600-750 metric tons were for Damascus and Aleppo. In 1660, coffee exports from Alexandria and Syria to Marseille, for French consumption and re-export to other European ports, amounted to 950 metric tons.*^ According to the 1780 edition of Raynal’s Histoire philosophique et politique du commerce et des etablissemens des Europeens dans les deux Indes, Arabia in the 1770s exported annually 12 to 13 million livres poids de table (6,000-6,500 metric tons) of coffee. Of that amount, 6.5 millon livres were conveyed by the Suez fleet, presumably for the needs of the Ottoman Empire; 3.5 million (by and large, coffee of inferior quality) went to Persia, 1.5 million went to Europe, 1 million (the best coffee) went by land caravans to Syria and Egypt, and about 50,000 livres poids de table (25 metric tons) were exported to Hindustan, the Maldives and the Arab colonies on the eastern African coast. The amount of coffee exported northward from Yemen thus was not much greater in the 1770s than in the 1680s. Of the quantity brought to Egypt by the Suez fleet and land caravans (via Syria), 750 metric tons were re-exported to Constantinople and 1,750 to Anatolia and Rumelia.
As of the 1720s and 1730s, however, other sources of coffee became available: coffee transplanted by the Dutch in Java and later coffee trans planted by the French in the West Indies. Between 1721 and 1726 Dutch imports of coffee from Java rose from 10% to 90% of Holland’s coffee imports. In 1775 France obtained 45,933,941 livres poids de table from Saint Dominique, 9,688,960 from Martinique, 6,302,902 from Guadeloupe and 65,888 from Cayenne. Of the total of 61,991,699 livres poids de table - approximately 31,000 metric tons - obtained from its American colonies, France consumed only 11,933,453 livres poids de table, exporting the rest - about 25,000 metric tons - mostly to the rest of Europe and to the Ottoman Empire. Rising to more than 600 metric tons in 1750,*® France’s average annual export of coffee to the Ottoman Empire (Smyrna, Thes saloniki, Constantinople, Aleppo, Seyde, Acre, Tripoli de Syrie, Chania and the Peloponnese) grew between 1776 and 1780 to 1,600-1,900 metric tons or almost 8% of its re-exports of coffee. Almost half that amount was destined for the Armenian regions of Anatolia and for Persia (for the most part by way of Smyrna). France’s imports of moka from Egypt, on the other hand, were then barely 250 metric tons and fell to 77 metric tons in 1784 and to 0 in 1785 and 1786. An additional 500 metric tons of moka from Egypt may have gone to the rest of Europe. France’s exports of coffee to the Ottoman Empire rose to an average of 1,962 metric tons between 1784 and 1786, distributed as follows: 1,127 metric tons to Smyrna, 397 to Constantinople (consumer of moka), 270 to Thessaloniki, 66 to the Pelo ponnese, 58 to Alexandretta (Iskenderun), 38 to Seyde, Acre, Cyprus and Tripoli de Syrie, 4 metric tons to Chania, and half a metric ton to Alexan dria, in comparison to an export of 79 metric tons to the Maghreb.” From the West Indies as a whole, Britain obtained annually during the 1770s about 73,000 quintals of coffee, over 35,000 metric tons.*® By the latter part of the 1770s Amsterdam imported annually 34-36 mil lion livres poids de table (approximately 17,000-18,000 metric tons): 14-15 million livres poids de table from Surinam alone, 8-10 million from the other Dutch colonies in America, 5 or 6 million from the other European colonial powers, and 4-6 million from the Dutch East Indies. Rotterdam may have imported from Surinam alone an additional 5-10 million livres poids de tabled^ By the late 1770s, therefore, France, Britain and the United Provinces alone - without Spain and Portugal - imported annually, for their own consumption and for re-export to the rest of Europe and to the Ottoman Empire and North Africa, about 60,000 metric tons of coffee from the Americas, five times as much coffee as was exported from Yemen and Arabia.

412 GREEK ECONOMIC HISTORY OF THE 15TH TO 19TH CENTURIES
Sugar Sugar, too, became a massively important product of world trade. French imports of sugar from Saint Dominique, Mar tinique, Guadeloupe and Cayenne in 1775 rose to 78,000 metric tons plus 5,000 tons from other sources. Of that total, 31,000 metric tons were retained for domestic consumption, while 52,000 metric tons were re exported. France’s export of sugar to the Levant attained an average of 975 metric tons between 1750 and 1755, 40% of that amount going to Smyrna, 28% to Constantinople, and 15.5% to Aleppo. In 1788, 32% (8.1 million Uvres tournois in value) of France’s exports to the Levant and the Maghreb comprised sugar, coffee and rum, all of them colonial prod ucts.^®
Dyes For its carpet and textile manufactures the Ottoman Empire required various dyes, especially indigo and dyewoods. The source of indigo had long since been located in the East. Around 1620, for example, Europe was in the habit of importing annually some 150-175 metric tons of indigo from Aleppo, a port of re-export.^* In 1788, on the other hand, France’s exports of indigo and dyewoods represented 12.5% (3,200,000 Uvres tournois) of the value of its total exports to the Ottoman Empire and North Africa. French exports of indigo to Ottoman ports had attained 134 metric tons around 1750, yet two decades later they fell to no more than 89 metric tons.^^ In 1775, France obtained from its Ameri can colonies some 1,030 metric tons of indigo, of which it re-exported 565 metric tons.^®
2. Ottoman product base: quantification
The commerce In a world perspective, the Levantine tradq' became of the Near East increasingly less important after 1620, and espe cially after 1700, than that of Asia and the Amer icas. At the same time, at least from about 1740, the Ottoman Empire began to contribute greater levies and probably a greater proportion of its gross domestic product to exports. As a result, the role of carriers or movers of bulky mass-consumption goods, especially Greeks, Hellenised Macedo-Vlachs, and Serbs, and later Bulgarians and Wallachians and Moldavians - all of the Eastern Orthodox faith - grew in importance. This last transformation could occur only because the Ottoman export base grew from less than 100,000 metric tons in 1620 to half a million between 1750 and 1800, to one million by the 1830s and to many more millions by 1912.
Europe’s commerce with the Levant around 1740 was half in value gs it had been around 1620, the low point having been reached around 1700. By the 1780s, it was 50% greater than in 1620, and, as in 1620, l^alf the Levantine and Balkan trade of Europe was carried out with France. France’s exports to the Levant around 1710 represented in value barely 1% of its total exports or 2% of its exports to Europe. Its imports therefrom, however, represented 5% of its imports from Europe. By the niid-1780s, on the other hand, they rose to 6% of its total imports and 10% of its imports from Europe, while its exports to the Levant, the Balkans and North Africa represented 4.9% of its total exports and 5.1% of its exports to Europe. Steadily declining between 1700 and the 1770s after having grown substantially during the previous century, England’s commerce with the Levant in the'1780s accounted for no more than 1% of its total foreign trade (imports and exports). Following the Napoleonic Wars, France’s share in the trade of Europe with the Ottoman Empire fell to no more than a sixth, while that of Britain rose to a third and that of the Germanies (including Austria) to a fourth.^^
The Balkan The raw materials and foods obtained by Europe from exports the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire varied from cen' tury to century. In some years during the first half of the 15th century, for example, Ragusa (Dubrovnik) imported 110-120 and perhaps even 200 metric tons of Serbian and Bosnian goods, including beeswax, leather and wool, as well as about 10 metric tons of silver. Dur ing the 16th century, European imports of Balkan wool grew in response to the expansion of Europe’s cloth manufactures after the 1520s.^® The average annual importation from the Balkans by Ragusan merchants alone during the latter half of the 16th century comprised, indeed, 6,0007,000 metric tons of grains, 100,000 cowhides (about 10 metric tons) and 800 to 1,000 metric tons of wool.^®
Wool The best Balkan wool was found in the Rhodope Mountains and, outside the Ragusan sphere of activity, in Thessaly and southwestern Macedonia. The embarkation port for the fine wool and the skins of the Thracian plain and Bulgarian Rhodope was Rodosto (Tekirdag). Ragusan merchants obtained other wool supplies from Tirana, Elbasan and Berat. Many of these places were also sources of beeswax for Ancona, for Pesaro, and for the candles of the churches of the papal states. As the result of continuing pastoralisation during the 17th and 18th
(^oMMERCE internal and external______________________________ 413

centuries, wool production in the Balkans continued to grow until 1800 or even 1830.
To ascertain the intensity of production regarding a particular product per square kilometre, one may divide the yield by the area of the producing territory. In 1815, the estimated intensity of sheep production per square kilometre for the Balkans south of the Sava and Danube rivers was 62.4 sheep (27.7 million divided by 444,000), compared to a human density of 16 persons.^’ At a possible wool yield of 1.5 kilograms per common sheep, the estimated wool production intensity per square kilometre may have been 93,6 kilograms. The total Balkan wool production may have reached 41,500 metric tons or an average of 5.9 kilograms per capita, while most of it was woven in rural homes for domestic use. The amount available per capita may have been higher around 1700, when the population of the Balkans may have reached its lowest level since the 15th century.
Only after 1730, when Austria and Germany began to need more wool for their developing cloth manufactures, did the wool of southwestern Macedonia and Thessaly begin to be sent overland to Austria. In the 1730s, a struggle thus ensued between Austria/Germany and France, of which the two contestants themselves may not have been immediately conscious, to acquire a larger proportion of the Macedonian and Thes salian wool. During the 16th and 17th centuries the Greek, Vlach and Albanian inhabitants of Thessaly, Epirus and Macedonia had sold their wool, skins, carpets and blankets to visiting merchants from Italy or to the privileged Jewish wool farm of Thessaloniki. Perhaps introduced toward the latter part of the 16th century or even during the 17th, during one of the down phases of a succession of possible Kondratieff cycles in Ottoman manu factures of woolen cloth, the wool farm or beylik of Jewish cloth manufac tures enjoyed, until 1731, the right to buy a certain amount of the ’wool production of Macedonia (and perhaps of neighbouring Thessaly) before any other buyers, at a low government-determined price. The right had been raised successively from 30,000 okas (38,400 kilograms) to 50,000 (64,000 kilograms) and then to a fifth of the total production. In the latter part of the 18th century, the price determined by the goverment was 4 paras per oka, as against the market price, 12-15 paras. Benefiting from this privilege the wool farm bought up wool supplies far in excess of its manufacturing needs, for it could resell the wool at a much higher price to European merchants and commission agents of wool-buying Livornese, Genoese, Venetian, Anconitan and Marseillais firms. The wool farm consequently opposed French attempts to import
Macedonian, Thessalian and Epirot wool to complement their imports of fine Spanish wool. The price rise that the Jews feared did in fact begin to occur as of 1725. On June 25, 1731, France’s ambassador, the marquis (je Villeneuve, obtained an order from the Ottoman government forbid ding the directors of the wool farm to buy more wool than was required for their manufactures. French and other European merchants in Thes saloniki, then negotiated a series of agreements with the directors of the ^ool farm. The wool farm agreed to allow the Europeans to buy wool at the same time. In return, the European merchant houses promised to divert a portion of their purchases (20% in the French case) to the Jews at a fixed low price. The Jewish regional wool monopoly thus was at least partially broken. Full liberty in the wool trade was instituted in the region in 1779, to the advantage both of European firms, who sent it by way of Durazzo to Venice and Trieste, and of local sheep farmers and Greek and Vlach merchants who moved the raw wool and yarn northward to Belgrade and to Vienna. The amount of wool collected annually in Thessaloniki for domestic manufacture and for exports amounted, during the latter half of the 18th century, to 400,000 to 500,000 okas (512 to 640 metric tons)^®. Wool exports to Marseille from the three Ottoman ports of Constantinople, Smyrna and Thessaloniki grew from 300 metric tons in 1701/1702 to almost 450 metric tons between 1750 and 1754, and to an average of more than 1,050 metric tons between 1786 and 1789. Exports of beeswax from the Ottoman Empire to Marseille similarly rose from under 150 metric tons during the first half of the 18th century to more than 200 metric tons annually between 1786 and 1789.^° The total amount of Balkan wool exports may have risen from several thousand metric tons in the 15th and 16th centuries to double that amount by the end of the 18th century. One may speculate that Balkan wool entering into commercial or quasi-com mercial circuits rose from well under 10% of the total product as late as 1730 to perhaps 15-20% by 1800 or 1830.
The proportion of Balkan wool entering into commercial circuits, how ever, declined soon thereafter. By 1834, Macedonian wool entering into a commercial circuit centred at Thessaloniki declined from 0.5 to 0.2 metric tons. The causes were partly internal: the flight of many wealthy Greek mer chants from Thessaloniki during and after the Greek war of independence and the diversion of wool exports to Durazzo.^* But they were also - and increasingly would become - international, due to the availability to Europe of Australian, Indian, and South African wool, and - for a short period - of

wool from Russia’s Black Sea ports. The export of wool from these ports grew from 652 metric tons in 1825 to 3,859 metric tons in 1841, when wool became their second most important export.^^ Great Britain’s imports of Australian wool rose from 2,440 metric tons in 1837 to 22,655 in 1857, when Britain also imported 8,918 metric tons from India and 6,578 metric tons from the Cape of Good Hope. At the same time, British wool imports from Germany declined from 38,000 metric tons in 1836 to 3,782 in 1837, to 9,887 in 1844, an average of 6,725 metric tons between 1850 and 1854, and an average of 3,567 between 1855 and 1858. European sources of British wool imports fell from 60% of Britain’s total wool imports in 1844 to 22% in 1858.^^ The story of wool was thereafter linked to that of wheat and other cereals.
Silk and Let us turn first, however, to two other textile products, silk cotton and cotton. An estimate by an English source of the silk. production in Persia in 1617 at 150 metric tons may be too low.^^ On the other hand, the estimate of the silk export from Alexandretta (Iskenderun) in 1618, on ships flying the French flag, at 800 metric tons may be too high. Closer to the mark may be the estimate of the imports of silk from Aleppo in that year by the European states at 600 metric tons, with a third of that amount being of Persian origin. Despite variations in the quantity of silk imported from the Levant by the individual European states, Europe’s total imports remained at 500 to 600 metric tons from 1600 to 1700, even though after 1630 a fourth or fifth of that quantity reached Europe by way of the Persian Gulf, while the Levantine source of supply later shifted from Aleppo to Smyrna^^. European imports of silk from the Ottoman Empire then declined. Eng land’s imports fell from an average of 170 metric tons between lOOOiand 1700 to 76 metric tons between 1761 and 1765. France’s imports fell from 150-160 metric tons between 1700 and 1702 to 75 metric tons between 1786 and 1789.36 t '
Estimates of Ottoman production of raw silk place it, around 1775, at between 165 and 440 metric tons. It slowly rose thereafter to about 600 metric tons in the 1850s for the Bursa region alone. The spread during and after 1858 of pebrine, a disease causing sterility in silkworms, reduced Bur sa’s production to less than 200 metric tons. The introduction on the world market of Chinese and Japanese silk - following the much earlier introduc tion of Bengal silk - and the quicker and cheaper means of transporting it to Europe after the opening of the Suez Canal caused Bursa’s production to drop to 150 tons by the 1880s. Following the depressed seventies and eighties, however, French demand spurred a rise in its silk production by
1912 to 800 metric tons. World silk production, though, continued to grow at a faster rate. From 7,000 metric tons in 1880, it rose to 14,000 tons in 1900 and 27,000 in 1912.3^ The increase in the silk production of the Bursa region between the 1850s and 1912, on the other hand, was only 25%.
The story of cotton has an even sadder conclusion. By 1638 cotton exports to Europe from Smyrna, then the chief cotton-producing region of the Ottoman Empire, amounted to 1,000 metric tons®*. By 1700, the portion of Ottoman cotton production entering into a commercial circuit may have amounted to 100,000 bales, roughly 11,000 metric tons. It rose by 1790 to 300,000 bales or 33,000 metric tons. But 80% of the cotton destined for commercial use in 1700 was produced in Syria, on Cyprus, and around Smyrna, Aydin, Bergama, Manissa, and the valleys of the two Menderes rivers. In 1790, half the Ottoman cotton entering a commercial circuit was produced in Macedonia and neighbouring regions. From 2,200 metric tons around 1700, Ottoman cotton exports to Europe rose to 11,000 in 1790.3® France’s imports of Ottoman raw cotton rose from an average of 216 metric tons during 1700-1702 to 2,628 at mid-century and to 4,800 between 1786 and 1789.'‘6 French imports of Ottoman cotton yarn, a semi-finished product, fell from an average of 847 metric tons during 1700-1702 to 540 metric tons during 1786-1789.^6 Marseille’s imports of cotton from Smyrna alone rose from an average of 106 metric tons between 1701 and 1705 to 157 between 1711 and 1715, 114 between 1721 and 1725, and 343 between 1731 and 1735. The average for 1741, 1742, 1743, and 1745 was 401, rising to 1,344 for 1751-1755, 1,441 for 1762-1764, 1,490 for 1771, 1772, and 1774, and 2,802 for 1783-1789.^'
According to Sevket Pamuk, the total Ottoman consumption of cotton in every form (except cotton used simply for padding) - yarn spun domesti cally, yarn imports and raw cotton of largely non-Ottoman origin employed to produce the Ottoman imports of cotton cloth - stood at 14,850 metric tons or one kilogram per capita around 1820, at 15,000-18,000 metric tons around 1840, at 28,050 metric tons or 1.5 kilograms per capita around 1870, and at 67,900 metric tons or 2.7 kilograms per capita around 1910. This growth was achieved, however, by a rise in imports of cotton in the form of cloth, from 450 metric tons around 1820 to 4,100 metric tons around 1840, to 17,300 metric tons around 1870, and to 49,350 metric tons around 1910; by a rise in imports of cotton in the form of yarn, from 150 metric tons around 1820 to 2,650 around 1840, to 7,750 around 1870, and to 12,550 around 1910; by a decline in domestic hand-spinniiig of cotton yarn from 11,550-14,250 metric tons around 1820 to 8,250-11,250 metric tons around 1840, to 3,000 metric tons around 1870, and to 1,000 around 1910; and by the addition to the 1910 figure of 5,000 metric tons of industrial yarn.^^

response to the formal opening of the Ottoman interior regions to European trade by a succession of commercial treaties concluded between 1838 and 1841 with Britain, France, Sardinia, Sweden, Spain, the Netherlands, Prus sia, Denmark, Tuscany, and Belgium, the cotton exports of Smyrna fell from a high of 4,600 metric tons in 1838 to less than 3,000 in 1840, to 600 in . 1846, to 2,000 in 1851, to 700 in 1857, and to 1,200 in 1858.^3 In crisis since 1800, 1813 or 1820, the cotton production of the most important cotton-producing Macedonian region, the district of Serres and the canton of Zichna, fell by the late 1840s to a meager 319 metric tons, half of which was consumed in the Ottoman Empire and the rest directed to Trieste and Odessa^^ During the 1860s, in response to the promotion of cot ton cultivation in order to compensate for the sharp decline in exports of the cotton of the warring American states, the cotton production of Macedonia was revived. By 1870 it rose to 10,000 metric tons, 9/10 of it produced in the Serres district and its environs, the rest in the hinterland of Thessalo niki. Almost immediately thereafter, however, Macedonian cotton production again collapsed.^^
Cultivations and In the half-century after 1780, the spatial disanimal husbandry: trihution of world cotton cultivation and conthe distribution sumption was radically altered. By 1850, more than a third of the world’s cotton production was consumed in Europe as against only 3% (of a total world production of 1.3 million tons) in 1790 and much less in 1700. By the 1850s, Euro pean imports of raw cotton from the Ottoman Empire probably did not represent more than 1.5% of Europe’s total cotton imports. Between 1790 and the late 1850s, on the other hand, Europe’s total imports of raw cot ton grew twenty times. In 1913, after the loss of most of its remaining European territories, Turkey’s cotton production (minus a 15% deduction for waste), mainly in the Aydin and Adana regions, was only 13,200 metric tons.'^® As world population and the size of cities grew after 1750, the eco nomic rent obtainable from the sale of wheat or other cereals grown on a given plot of land expanded more quickly than the rent obtainable by the sale of wool, tallow, skins and meat - from the raising of sheep on the same plot of land. The process of pushing populations with a growing labour supply from the raising of sheep and other pastoral occupations to the cultivation of cereals intensified, as the costs of long distance trans portation by sea for mass-consumption products (wool and cereals alike) were cut down, especially from about 1840. This evolution was made possible by the fact that there were extensive lands with a low labour supply - like Australia and South Africa - from which wool and other
^piUl^RCE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL 419
pastoral products could be obtained in greater quantities than from the older lands of pastoral activity. In response to such pressures, the sheep count in the Crimea fell from 11 million in the early 1850s to 138,000 in 1880.^’ The sheep count per thousand inhabitants in the Balkans fell to 1/2 between 1815 and 1859 and to 1/4 between 1815 and 1914.'^® The export of cereals from Russia’s Black Sea ports, on the other hand, much of it carried on Greek ships flying the Russian flag, grew from 10,000 metric tons in 1786 to 24,000 in 1793, an average of more than 160,000 metric tons between 1826 and 1830, 118,000 between 1831 and 1835, and more than 300,000 between 1836 and 1845.^®
Olive oil and The traditional triad of the economy in lands soap manufacture that were both Mediterranean and continental, as was the homeland of the Greeks, comprised not only cereals and wool but also olive oil. The olive oil produced in Crete, the Peloponnese and the Aegean Archipelago was used mainly for culinary purposes. In the 18th century, however, an increasing proportion of the production of Crete in particular, which fluctuated between 22,000 and 66,000 hectolitres, was diverted to the making of soap. The number of soap factories in Herakleion (Candia) grew from 12 in 1748 to 15 in 1763 and to 18 in 1787. In Chania, the number fluctuated from 40 in 1745 to 50 in 1772 and to 25 in 1794. In 1794 there were also 8 soap factories in Rethymno, all managed by Jewish barataires under French protection. The soap production of Crete thus grew from an average of 675 metric tons between 1735 and 1737 to 6,000 metric tons between 1787 and 1789, half of which was exported to Constantinople and 2/5 to Smyrna, Thes saloniki and Syria. . French imports of olive oil from Crete, mostly for Marseille’s soap manufactures, grew from 12,000 hectolitres around 1700 to 23,000 between 1707 and 1721 but fell to 17,000 around 1740 and to 8,000 by the 1750s. French imports of olive oil from the Peloponnese and other parts of the Levant grew from 5,000 hectolitres around 1700 to an average of 15,000 hectolitres between 1707 and 1721 and to 18,000 around 1740, only to drop to 16,000 in the 1750s. Rising to 6,066 metric tons in 1839 (roughly twice the 18th century maximum of 39,000 hectolitres), France’s imports of olive oil from the Levant fell to 2,567 tons in 1875 (below the 18th century maximum). Since soap was a staple much in demand by the baths of the capital, the soap manufactures of Crete and holders of revenue rights to local oil were able to prevent attempts by French mer


420 GREEK ECONOMIC HISTORY OF THE 15TH TO 19TH CENTURIES
chants to subvert the command economy through buying olive oil directly from peasant cultivators at a higher non-regulated price. At the same time, attempts by Greeks like the French barataire Sarandos Papadopoulos to found soap factories in the Peloponnese were obstructed by French consuls acting upon the orders of their government, which wanted both to discourage foreign manufactures and to avoid a rise in the price of olive oil under the stimulus of rising local demand for the product.®®
Cereals and Very few Ottoman products, however, were supposed state control to be exported without formal authorisation. This rule applied in particular to goods of potential military use and to foodstuffs, especially cereals, considered necessary for the mainte nance of tranquillity in cities and garrisons. The prohibition was over looked sometimes for fiscal reasons. It was also disregarded under the pretense that the goods were being transferred to some other part of the Ottoman realm. Officially, however, the sale of cereals to foreign traders was illegal from 1604 until after 1810.®‘ The prohibition could be countermanded, however, by an Ottoman order (fertnan) that only the rich and powerful could purchase. When a harvest was abundant, the rules were relaxed, particularly in ports distant from Constantinople. Such ports included Durazzo, Arta, Pyrgos, Corinth, Napoli de Romania (Nafplion), the gulfs of Volos, Kassandra, Mount Athos and Strymon (Struma), as well as Trikkeri, Katerini, Kavala and Lagos. Island ports of wheat export included Psara, Skyros and Urla. Anatolian ports from which wheat was exported to Italy and France included Jandarli, Ayvalik (Kydoniai) and Scala Nova (Kusadasi).®^ In 1550-1551, the Grand Vizier Rustem Pasa himself sold 36,000 hectolitres of wheat (almost 2,600 metric tons) to Ragusan buyers. Other sellers included the reigning sultan and members of his family. Ottoman exports of cereals to Italy during some years of the second half of the 16th century may have amounted to 16,800-22,400 metric tons.®® A hypothetical estimate of the cereal production of the Balkans south of the Sava and Danube rivers places it at 1.5 million metric tons in the 1520s, at 2.0-2.4 million in the 1580s, at 1.7 million around 1700, and at 1.9 million around 1800. The cereal requirements of the Ottoman cities at the same area may have been about 56,000 metric tons in 1520, 100,000 metric tons in 1580, 174,000 in 1700, and 250,000 in 1800. Of these amounts, cereals directly entering a commercial circuit - that is, without passing through some form of authoritative redistribution - are unlikely to have
exceeded 53,000-64,000 metric tons in 1520, 74,000-85,000 metric tons in 1580, 60,000 in 1700, and 67,000 in 1800. On the basis of these specula tions, one may surmise that the need to resort to measures of redistribution or devolution in order to fill the needs of Balkan Ottoman cities rose from no more than several thousand tons in the 1520s to 20,000 tons in 1580, to 110,000 in 1700, and td 180,000 in 1800.®^ Since the grain deliveries to Constantinople by means of the devolutionary system of grain purchases for the state at fixed low prices (i0ra) from both the Aegean (Balkan and Anatolian) and Black Sea regions supposedly amounted to 237,000 metric tons in 1758, the estimate of forced deliveries from the Balkans south of the Danube and Sava - mainly from the Aegean and the Bulgarian Black Sea areas - at around 1700 or 1800 would seem to be reasonably correct. The istira (1/10 of the wheat product after payment of the tithe or tenth to the holder of timar rights) obligatory at the sanjak of Thessaloniki (Thessaloniki, Yannitsa, Edessa) in the 1780s was 120,000 Constantinopolitan kile (of 20 okas in common practice) or 3,072 metric tons. That of the sanjak of Volos, Yenigehir (Larissa) and Phanari was 2,048 metric tons, and that of the sanjak of Kavala was 1,536 metric tons; a total for the three sanjaks of 6,656 metric tons. In 1714 and 1734, the i§tira for the Thessaloniki sanjak had been respectively 3,840 and 2,560 metric tons. The total wheat production of the Thessaloniki sanjak in the 1780s consequently may have been 73,956 metric tons, compared to a wheat production of 105,420 metric tons in approximately the same but perhaps somewhat reduced area in 1929.®®
Production The suggested hypothetical cereal production of 1.7 miland export lion metric tons in 1700 and of 1.9 million in 1800 for of cereals Balkan region south of the Sava and Danube rivers may also find support in the estimate of Bulgarian cereal production in 1840 after the expansion of the Bul garian cereal economy had already begun. The British vice-consul to Galati placed it, in effect (without defining what he meant by Bulgaria, but includ ing Danubian Bulgaria and almost certainly excluding Macedonia and Thrace), at more than 125,000 metric tons of wheat and at 108,000-122,000 metric tons of maize, barley, rye, etc. Bulgarian wheat exports at that time aiiiounted to 21,000 metric tons from the port of Varna and to 10,500 metric tons from Constanta, while maize exports from the same ports stood at 18,000 and 9,000 metric tons, representing a total cereal export of about 60,000 metric tons - a one-third increase over Bulgarian cereal exports from the same region in the late l830s and an increase in the share of cereal exports from 18% to 24% of the total Bulgarian cereal production. Cereal exports from Varna, Burgas and Balchik rose from 128,000 metric tons in

1845 to 180,000 in 1847.®® In similar fashion, wheat became, between 1846 and 1875, the most important export product of the Macedonian port of Thessaloniki, reaching by mid-century 21,000 to 24,500 metric tons.®’ The foregoing estimates of Balkan cereal production do not include the cereal production of Wallachia, Moldavia and Bessarabia. The average annual export of cereals from Moldavia to Constantinople during the 16th century was about 25,000 metric tons.®® But in response to urban growth, to the example of state-promoted cereal expansion in Hungary - from 1,953,000 metric tons in 1789 to 4,662,000 in 1841, with a further production in 1841 of 602,000 metric tons in Transylvania and 254,000 at the Military Fron tier®® - and to cereal exports from the Russian Black Sea littoral, the cereal production of Wallachia and Moldavia may have doubled between 1750 and 1800 from a hypothetical 200,000-250,000 to a hypothetical 400,000500,000 metric tons, doubling again by 1845 or 1850. From 1837 to 1840, the average annual export of grains from the Mol davian port of Braila and Wallachian port of Galati stood at 970,000 hecto litres of wheat, 510,000 hectolitres of maize and 11,4,000 hectolitres of other grains; in effect, a total grain export of about 100,000 metric tons. For the years 1845 and 1847 the average cereal export from those two ports reached 1,374,000 hectolitres of wheat and 1,533,000 hectolitres of maize, a total of 200,000 metric tons of wheat and maize.®® By 1880 or the early 1880s, the total wheat production of the Balkan countries broke down as follows:®'

Greece 145,656 imports exceed exports
Romania 1,432,000 350,200
Serbia 130,176 21,600
The wheat exports of Bulgaria, Romania and Serbia represented at that time 24, 24, and 17 percent of the respective wheat production of these countries. The level of wheat exports from Romania (Moldavia and Walla chia) was five times as great as during 1837 to 1840 and 3.5 times as great as during 1845 to 1847. Bulgarian wheat exports, on the other hand, were only 26% greater than in 1840, probably as a consequence of the disturbance of the country’s economy by war and the territorial and political changes imposed by the Congress of Berlin.
^g^p^.RCE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL 423
By 1880, the total cereal production of Romania was at least three mil lion metric tons. That of the Balkans south of the Sava and Danube was about four million, accounting for 5.4% of Europe’s total wheat production, ^vith Romania accounting for another 4.4%. The cereal production of Serbia rose by 1908 to 991,425 metric tons, ten times the production of the same territories in 1833.®’ Probably less than a million metric tons in 1880, the cereal production of Anatolia grew rapidly thereafter, rising in 1909 to 2,970,000 metric tons. The grain exports of Anatolia’s four major ports (Trabzon, Samsun, Adana and Smyrna) rose from an average of 87,000 metric tons during 1876-1880 to 287,000 metric tons during 1891-1895 and to 203,000 during 1901-1905.®®
Tobacco and The export of cereals, lumber and other products Other products from the Sulina channel (the most important Danube mouth) grew from 2.7 million metric tons between 1868 and 1870 to 13.4 million between 1906 and 1910.®^ The export of tobacco from Drama alone, by way of the port of Kavala, rose from an aver age of 1,525 metric tons during 1869 and 1870 to 2,441 tons between 1871 and 1875.®® Total Ottoman tobacco exports grew from 11,000 metric tons between 1879 and 1883 to almost 26,000 between 1908 and 1911, out of a total product of 63,500 metric tons in 1911. The leading Ottoman export (in value) since 1875, wheat then yielded to tobacco in response to a fourfold increase in the price of that commodity, inspired by American demand.®® Rising to 214 metric tons in 1857, opium exports from Smyrna may have amounted between 1864 and 1875 to 400 metric tons, representing in value 10% of the exports of Smyrna itself and 5% of total Ottoman exports.®’ Imports, too, acquired a mass-consumption basis. Ottoman coal imports, for example, grew from 88,000 metric tons in 1878-1879 to 440,000 in 19111913. Kerosene (petroleum) imports grew from 27,000 to 178,000 tons.®®
3. Diaspoms and territorial tripartition
A prerequisite to European industrial growth was a prior growth in the demand for, and in the supply of, foodstuffs, raw materials and other mass-consumption goods.®® The importance of the Ottoman Empire as a source of supply of such materials, however, depended on the capability of each European state to obtain raw materials from other markets and on its need of the Ottoman market as an outlet for its own semi-finished products, manufactures and colonial goods. But as,supply and demand factors were altered between the 15th century and World War I, the role of each of the commercial diasporas in facilitating the diversion of Otto man raw materials to one foreign state or another, and in prornoting the


424 GREEK ECONOMIC HISTORY OF THE 15TH TO 19TH CENTURIES
diffusion of one or more foreign products to the Ottoman Empire itself, was modified likewise. Let us picture a world circuit of communication and exchange as a partly autonomous energy system held together by political, religious and cultural means, in which people mobilise sunlight, water and the organic and inorganic resources of the earth in order to obtain the foodstuffs, fuel, fibres and other clothing and building materials with which to meet the desires of resident individuals and groups, in this manner preventing both their elimination and rebellion as well as satisfying the hierarchical principles of the political, social, religious and cultural order. One of the chief means of replicating distinctions between two neigh bouring energy systems, as in modifying species, is isolation. But the isolation of the energy systems has never been total, for political principles encourage the organisation of an energy system around a central inland core. Economic principles pull it toward its peripheries - toward zones of intercommunication, especially around coastal regions. A dichotomy of this kind was clearly evident in the Ottoman Empire which, by the 1520s, included territories of three continents, separated from each other by four or five seas: the Black, the Red, the Aegean, the Ionian and the Sea of Marmara. Along with the wider Mediterranean, they were the chief means of Ottoman and Greek communication with several other world economies. The areas of most intensive Ottoman cultivation of cereals and cash crops were situated immediately around portions of these seas and their hinterlands. By contrast, the interior regions were mainly a zone of pastoralism.
The intermediaries Linkage between the two areas and between the Ottoman Empire as a whole and the Atlantic-European economy was made by various intermediaries: product spe cialists, pack-horse drivers, boatmen, peddlers, brokers (simsar, sensal, censal), and other persons with knowledge of the languages, coinage, weights and measures, customs, laws and idiosyncrasies of the regions with which they communicated. Of diverse ethnic, religious and state origins, the intermediaries were concentrated in various parts of the core area. A large part of the insular and coastal area - consequently, almost the whole of the Ottoman core — was the homeland of the Greeks. The core of Armenian settlement, on the other hand, extended fourteen or fifteen leagues around Tokat, a city in which resided Turks, Greeks and Jews, as well as Armenians, while their ‘sacral locus’ was territorially peripheral EtchmiadzinTM. The ‘sacral locus’ of the archetypal Jewish dias

rjora was Jerusalem. All three of these diaspOras were present also in many Ottoman cities, along many routes leading to other world econo mies, and in cities; centres of exchange, and sometimes rural districts of Other world economies.
The Armenians The oldest of the Ottoman diasporas, the Armenian, was spread out in the 15th century along the silk route from the Caspian Sea to Syria. Armenian merchants continued to sup ply Syria with silk after the Ottoman conquest of that country in the early part of the 16th century. Present also in Polish cities as early as 1375, they supplanted. the Genoese colonies in the Crimea during the 15th century, forming their own colonies along the so-called Moldavian route to Lwow via Akkerman (Belgorod) and Sugeava. In 1589, ‘rich’ merchants in Lwow numbered 22 Armenians (nominally, Gregorian Christians), eight Roman Catholic Poles and Germans, and six Ukrainian Uniates. The ‘poor’ mer chants numbered 19 Armenians, two Roman Catholics and three Uniates.''* In exchange for European textiles and hardware, other Armenians sup plied Poland and Hungary, via the sea route to Pera, with silks from the manufacturing town of Bursa and with pepper re-exported from Syria. By way of the great unraveling point or wholesaling emporium of Tokat, ‘un des plus grands passages de I’Orient’, other Armenian merchants supplied Bursa and Smyrna with raw silk from the Caspian districts. The most important Armenian export to India was saffron, a product grown in large quantity in the Tokat region. A species of crocus whose dried orange-coloured stigmas were used as medicine, as perfume and salve, for colouring and for seasoning, it was preserved in beeswax, with which it was sold as a unit.'*' Other Armenians re-exported pepper, various spices and ‘eastern’ or Indian goods from Sinop or Trabzon (Trebizond) by sea to the mouth of the Danube and, from Braila overland to Cimpulung and the Saxon towns of Kronstadt (Brasso, Bragov) or Hermannstadt (Nagyszeben, Sibiu). From these last points, local Saxon merchants often conveyed them along the Magna Via to Clausenburg (Kolozsvar, Cluj) and Grosswardein (Nagyvarad, Oradea) and thence either westward to Buda (Ofen) and Pozsony (Bratis lava) or northward to Kascha (Kassa, Kosice). At Buda and Kascha, the ‘eastern’ goods were sold or exchanged for woolen cloth of western or central European origin.'^ In the course of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Armenian merchants consolidated their position in southeastern and central Europe, extended their trade northward to Russia and the Baltic, and' moved outward from Constantinople into the Balkan interior. In this last area they encountered the competition of Ragusan (Dubrovnik), Jewish and Greek mercantile diasporas. But the most important line of Armenian commercial advance


426 GREEK ECONOMIC HISTORY OF THE 15TH TO 19TH CENTURIES
was westward to Livorno and, as early as 1563, to Amsterdam, and east ward, at least as early as 1554, to the Mughal court of Akbar the Great. Their eastward penetration to Sucat and their implantation of mercan tile colonies at Delhi, Lahore and Agra, along India’s Grand Trunk Road between Peshawar and Calcutta, was facilitated by a great disaster: the with drawal from Turkey in 1605 of the Persian army and the forced transfer by Shah Abbas I (1587-1629) of tens of thousands of Armenian families to the silk-growing provinces of Gilan and Mazanderan, at the rims of the Caspian, and the deportation of the population of Julfa, on the left bank of the Araxes (Araz), to New Julfa (Nor Julay), a new suburb of Persian Ispahan. Their further penetration to the Dutch East Indies and Philippines was partly a consequence of their role as intermediaries for Dutch merchants in Syria and Persia, and of the establishment in 1612 of an important Armenian merchantcolony in Amsterdam.’^
In 1768, three quarters of the merchandise charged on Dutch ships may have belonged to Greek, Jewish and Armenian merchants. The Arme nian merchant colony of Amsterdam, however, still outnumbered the Greek merchants who had begun to come there in 1730. By 1787, though, by their control of the wholesale and retail trade of woolen cloth in Smyrna, western Anatolia and the Aegean islands, and by the leverage which that control gave them over Dutch exporters of cloth, the number of Greek commercial enterprises in Amsterdam rose to more than 50, outnumbering Armenian and Jewish merchants alike.’^ Commerce took some Armenian merchants to Bengal, Tibet, Tonkin, Indonesia and China, while Armenians owed their continuing importance as intermediaries in Aleppo, Smyrna and Constantinople to the immigra tion to Constantinople, Galata, Scutari, Bursa and Smyrna, by 1608, of thousands of Armenians from central and eastern Anatolia, and to the preference of the English, especially in Aleppo, for Armenian as against
Jewish intermediaries.’® /| i’’
The Ragusans Like their Genoese predecessors, the Armenian com mercial diaspora came into contact at the mouth of the Danube with a commercial diaspora whose home base was the Adri atic city republic of Ragusa (Dubrovnik). Until the 14th century, Ragusan merchants had obtained raw materials — grains, timber and beeswax mainly from the immediate hinterland of their city and, by sea, in Alba nia (especially Avlona) and in Volos and the Gulf of Patras, thus in areas only several days distant by horse or mule from the Adriatic, Ionian or Aegean seas. Between the mid-14th and mid-15th century, however, their most valuable trade lay further inland, consisting of the importation of
gilver and lead from the mines of Serbia and Bosnia, which Ragusa subgequently re-exported to Venice, Ancona, Pisa, Florence and Alexandria in return for pepper, other spices and textiles.”
In 1442, 1458 and 1481, the Ottoman state granted Ragusa the right to sell their goods throughout the Ottoman Empire, applying a lower rate of duty to them than to their own non-Muslim subjects, to European trad ers, or, except in Constantinople (under Ottoman rule as of 1453), even to Muslims. Between 1510 and 1521, this privilege often was curtailed. It was restored in 1521 and maintained (although not without violations) until 1687, except in the three cities of Constantinople, Adrianople and Bursa, where the official rate for Muslims was set at a lower level, and, in practice, in Buda, Temesvar and other Pannonian towns.’® Following the Ottoman conquest of Serbia, Bosnia and Hercegovina during the second half of the 15th century, the Ottoman state reserved for its own needs the silver of its mines, which were in a state of slow decline before the end of the 16th century.’® On the other hand, Ragusa continued to export textiles to the Ottoman Empire and to import wool, skins and beeswax. In its overland trade, it established permanent mercantile colonies southward to a line lying north of maritime Macedonia, then eastward to Rodosto on the Sea of Marmara, northward to Edirne and eastward to the Black Sea. Its colonies extended northward to the mouth of the Danube knd westward along the Danube to Belgrade, a collection centre for hides from Hungary. Taking over in Wallachia, after 1469, the commercial role of the Genoese merchant colonies from the Crimea, Ragusan merchants did business in Isaccea, Tulcea, Bender, Babadag, Ismail and Bucharest.®® In addition to their carrying trade by sea with the wheat-producing districts of Albania and Greece, their maritime trade extended to Rodosto, where they picked up goods from Thrace and Bulgaria, and to the Bulgarian Black Sea ports. Their ships also brought woolen cloth, spices, jewelry and marine salt to Senj in the northern Adriatic, to be conveyed therefrom overland to Zagreb and Buda.®* Profiting from their commercial privileges and from their tributary relationship to the Ottoman Empire, Ragusan merchants extended their overland trade northward after the Ottoman conquest of Belgrade and most of Hungary between 1521 and 1541. Establishing Belgrade and Smederevo as collection points for wool, skins and hides from Slavonia and Hungary,®’ they also made use of Sofia as a collection point for sheep and goat skins, and Provadia, Silistre, Ruse and the Dobruja as collection points for leather, lamb skins, and cow and buffalo hides (montonini, vacchini and buffalini) from Danubian Bulgaria. Succeeding in playing a major role in the maritime carrying trade of the Mediterranean by the 1540s, their ships carried wool and other goods from the Black Sea port of Varna to Mediterranean ports. They continued

428 GREEK ECONOMIC HISTORY OF THE 15TH TO 19TH CENTURIES
to do so until the Ottoman closing of the Black Sea to European ships in the 1590s. Ragusans engaged in the overland caravan trade founded small mercantile colonies in Philippoupolis (Plovdiv) and Adrianople. They were briefly present as far south as Serres, but their commercial penetration never extended to Thessaloniki, whose commerce after 1502 was largely in the hands of Jewish merchants.®^ Their imports - mostly for the needs of Constantinople and other Otto man cities - included woolen cloth of Venetian, Florentine or Ragusan manufacture. They also brought English kersies (carisees), silks, fabrics (etoffes), damask linen (damas), bonnets, spices, sugar, jewelry, watches and mirrors. During the first half of the 15th century and again from the 1540s to the 1580s, there may have been present in southeastern Europe, for some yearsat least, up to 400-500 Ragusan merchants and assistants and apprentices, with a further complement in the 16th century of several thousand transient peddlers. Unlike the Ragusan merchants in the overland trade of the 14th and 15th centuries, however, no longer dealing in precious metals, the merchants were no longer nobles, and their assistants and apprentices often came from the villages of the republic or from Hercegovina, especially Popdvo Polje.®^ Just as numerous or at least half as numerous around 1640 as during the 16th century, the number of Ragusan merchants regularly involved in a Balkan overland trade fell to half the 1640 number by 1670 and to a fifth by 1688. In Bosnia and Hungary, their commerce began to be eclipsed around 1640 by the competition of Greek merchants from the south, Armenian merchants from the east and Jewish merchants from the west.®®
The Greeks The presence of ethnic or cultural Greeks in areas of production of certain crops and of the hunting, gather ing or extraction of other resources, not necessarily as producers and gatherers but as middlemen charged with the spatial redistribution of
such resources, gave them an opportunity to emerge as specialists in the exchange of the goods obtainable in these areas for goods from^ other
areas with which they were in direct or indirect correspondence. A certain degree of correspondence existed between the territorial origins of a particular group of middlemen and the goods in which they dealt. Dealers in raw cotton, cotton yarn and cottons came almost wholly from the main areas of cotton production: the environs of Smyrna, Syria, the eastern Mediterranean, and Macedonia and Thessaly. Wool merchants were an ethnically and culturally more varied group, including Jews, Greeks from Macedonia, Thessaly and Epirus, Anatolian Greeks, and Serbs and Bulgarians. In Gonstantinople, half the stockbrokers were
Greeks, one out of seven was a Jew, and one out of seven an Armenian. pjon-Muslims were rare in finance. Indeed, three out of ten sarafs or mon eychangers in the capital were Greeks, three out of ten were. Armenians, and two out of ten were Jews. The trade in Moroccan leather, a commodity whose export was specifically prohibited, as well as in satin and pearls, was mostly in Jewish hands. The fur trade, which took merchants to Russia, was in Greek hands. In 19th century Anatolia, four out of nine middlemen in international commerce were Greeks and three out of nine were Armenians. Muslims, on the other hand, prevailed in the eastern trade and trade in the Arab parts of the Ottoman Empire until the latter part of the 18th century. The trade in silk cocoons, silk yarn and silks was divided between Greeks and Armenians, partly because much of the silk originated in Persia and areas of Armenian settlement around the southern shores of the Caspian Sea.
At the beginning of the 20th century, roughly fifty out of a hundred manufacturing enterprises in the capital were Greek, twenty out of a hun dred were Armenian, fifteen were Turkish and five were Jewish. The labour force in such enterprises was 60% Greek, 15% Armenian, 15% Turkish and 10% Jewish.®’ In the latter part of the 18th century and during the first three decades bf the 19th, some inspectors of markets in towns like Belgrade were Hellenized Macedo-Vlachs (Arumanians). Much of the trade of the Balkan interior was likewise in the hands of Greeks or Macedo-Vlachs. In Serbia, the trade in raw skins was almost entirely in Greek hands as late as 1848.®®
A further aspect of Greek participation in the commerce both of the ports and of interior regions - in the Balkans in particular but also in Anatolia and, in the 19th century, in Egypt and the Sudan - was their role as grocers or bakkals. In the mid-18th century, the guild of Constanti nople grocers numbered 60-80 enterprises. Bakkals, many of them Greeks, were also numerous in Smyrna, Thessaloniki and other Ottoman ports. In conformity with the rules of Ottoman administered trade, European exporters of sugar and indigo in the Ottoman capital sold their products to the head of the grocers’ guild, who then distributed them among the individual grocers, paying for the goods only after the individual grocers had discharged their own debts to him. The grocers of the ports provi sioned the grocers of the interior towns.®® Of negligible importance in interregional and international commerce during the last centuries of Byzantium, Greeks began to play a major role in trade under Ottoman rule. But the transformation occurred step by step. They did not begin as traders in silks, spices or precious commodi

ties - the Armenian specialty, because of their familiarity with the Persian and Asian worlds. Nor did they begin as traders in woolen cloth - the Jewish specialty, because of their familiarity with European cloth manu factures. They began rather as provisioners of food; as millers, manufac turers and shipbuilders; and as carriers - the Greek specialties, because of the central location of their homeland within the Ottoman Empire and because that homeland was simultaneously European, Asian and insular, facilitating trade by land and sea alike. The rise of a Greek merchantry is linked to the expulsion of the Genoese from the Black Sea during the second half of the 15th century, to the Ottoman need early in the 16th century to build a navy, to Ottoman urbanisation policies and to the surrender to the Turks, in 1566, of theGenoese island of Chios (Scio). The expulsion of the Genoese favoured Armenian merchants even more, but it did give an opportunity to some Greeks who claimed to be descendants of such noble Byzantine families as the Batazidai, Chrysoloroi, Azanaioi and Chalkokondyles to become taxfarmers and provisioners of Black Sea products and suppliers of Rus sian furs. Michael ‘Son of the Devil’ Cantacuzenus, the wealthiest tax farmer in mid-16th-century Constantinople, until his hanging in 1576, also built each year fifteen or more galleys for the Ottoman fleet, a role that allowed him, a hundred years before the appearance of the Phanariots, to nominate Greek Orthodox bishops and the princes of Moldavia and Wallachia.®®
The Chiots Benefiting from the extension by Suleyman the Law giver of judicial and administrative privileges to the town and port of Chios and even more from their own spirit of enterprise, Chiots profited from their ownership of citrus plantations and groves of mastic evergreens (source of a resin chewed by the ladies of the capital as an oral freshener) to become provisioners of the Ottoman capital. Also importing raw silk from Rumelia, Bursa and the Peloponnese, they exported the silk manufactures of their island to Smyrna and Constanti nople. Other Chiots later settled in Constantinople as cloth merchants. Indeed, the common designation by French business firms in Constanti nople in the 18th century for Greek cloth merchants was chiotes. In the 17th century, Chios had produced fabrics for export to Cairo, Constanti nople, Anatolia and the Maghreb. In the 18th century, Chiots also made braids (gaitans) that were used to decorate Ottoman clothing but were also exported to Italy, France, Germany and especially Poland. Among the richest of Greek merchants by 1700 — in comparison, Jews were said to be
^jeggars - Chiots settled in Smyrna in large numbers after the long war of Candy (Crete). By 1800, there were some 500 Greek business firms in Smyrna, many of them owned by Chiots. The largest and wealthiest of these firms had correspondents or branches in Vienna, Trieste, Livorno, Genoa and the ports of the Black Sea.®* On the island of Chios itself, Chiot moneychangers or sarafs met Euro pean boats with chests of monies, providing the crew and travelers with local currency in exchange for the silver coin of Europe. The constantly fluctuating ratios in the value of silver, differences in the rate of exchange from port to port and from city to city, the circulation of counterfeit coins and repeated devaluations by the government made necessary the use of such specialists who ‘could make money talk’.®^
The Greeks of As urbanisation continued - the growth of large Balkan countries cities in the 16th century and of smaller towns in the 17th and 18th centuries - Greeks of more humble origins and other Orthodox Christians obtained control of much of the commerce in the eastern half of the Balkans and in Wallachia and Moldavia, sharing it with Armenians, Jews and Ragusans between 1540 and 1640, but thereafter playing a more important role than their rivals in that area.®^ Two Greek merchants, indeed, Demetrius Condi and his son Matheus Demetrius, along with several Armenians, were present in the north-central Balkan town of Belgrade as early as 1538. In commercial relations with Avlona, Buda, Ferrara and Venice, they brought silks, woolen cloth and camel skins to Belgrade. The father of Demetrius Condi was a merchant in Venice.®^
The Phanariots Greek imports to Wallachia and Moldavia in the 16th century included not only goods of Balkan origin but also pepper, saffron and other spices. The ‘Greek’ commercial penetration of Wallachia, Moldavia and Transylvania was a slow process, however, until the war of Candy (1645-1669) between Venice and the Ottoman Empire. During and after the war, Greek suppliers for Constan tinople of fruit from the Aegean islands and other men of wealth - wealth made sometimes in Constantinople but accumulated more frequently from enterprise in Chios and other Aegean islands, or in Smyrna, loannina, or Kastoria — known as Phanariots (so named after the quarter in the capi tal in which some of them lived) played an ever more important role as taxfarmers. As a result, they acquired such political-economic ‘farms’ as the new posts of Dragoman of the Porte (undersecretary to the Grand

Vizir), Dragoman of the Fleet (undersecretary of the Navy and in charge of Aegean affairs), and - for a full century after 1716 - hospodars (chief tax farmers) of Wallachia and Moldavia, positions that were the means to yet more wealth and influence.®®
Transylvania In 1636, the Prince of Transylvania granted Greek (Orthodox) merchants the right to engage in wholesale trade in the commercial fairs of the country and to form their own mer chant guilds, a privilege that allowed them to expand their commerce in Transylvania during the subsequent century and a half.®® As a result, Greeks and Vlachs from Macedonia took over much of the regional trade of the Saxons of Transylvania. In fact, they were now the chief merchantsin a long-distance trade to Buda, which led from loannina and Kastoria, partly by way of the Via Egnatia, to Adrianople - presumably by way of the rising fairs - or from Constantinople to Adrianople, thence to Selimno (Sliven), Rusguk (Ruse), Giurgiu, Bucharest, Cimpulung, Cronstadt, and by way of the Magna Via to Buda.®’ As of the 1720s, the commerce of the overland route between Thessa loniki or Serres and Belgrade and Vienna came under the control of Greeks and Vlachs from Macedonia, Thessaly and Epirus, as did the commerce of the overland route from loannina, Kastoria and Monastir eastward to Thrace and Constantinople, and northward from Constantinople and Thrace across Bulgaria to Wallachia and Moldavia, and thence northward to Nezhin (a small town northeast of Kiev and south of Chernigov) or, especially after 1740, westward across Poland to the Leipzig fairs,i Usually following the itineraries of the local or regional fairs.®® 'j
Between 1720 and 1800, Greek merchants became, along with co-reli gionist Serbs — who, in the northern and eastern regions, were known to central Europeans as ‘Rascians’ and, in the western regions, as ‘Illyrians’ - the dominant group of merchants in Serbia, Transylvania, Hungary and Slavonia. Around the middle of the 18th century, Greeks and GrecoVlach merchants also began to come to Bosnia. Around 1770, 3/5 of these merchants were from four communities: Moschopolis, Katranitsa, Kozane (Kozani) and Blatse. Also well represented among these merchants were the town of Kastoria and the villages of Kleisoura and Metsovo®®. To arrive at a correct appreciation of the Greek diaspora, however, one must also evaluate the role of the Jewish diaspora or, in a general sense, the oldest of the world’s diasporas. Except in the Crimea, however, prior to the expulsion of the Jews from Spain in 1492, Jews probably did not number more than several thousand persons in territories that once had
INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL 433
been Byzantine and became Ottoman. Between 1492 and 1600, as a result Qf immigration from Spain, Portugal, North Africa and Italy, and of the Ottoman conquest of a large part of Hungary, they may have numbered piore than 100,000, perhaps 200,000 persons.*®®
The Jews In 1502, Spanish Jews settled in Thessaloniki to which they brought their skills in the manufacture of arms and cloth, I’arte della lana. Jews also settled in Castelnuovo (Herceg Novi), a castle town founded in 1382 south of the city state of Ragusa*®’ following jts fall to the Turks, and the number of Jews also grew in Ragusa, to rise there by 1571 to more than 150 Levantine, Spanish and Portuguese Jews. Jewish merchants eliminated the commerce of Ragusa in Serres, but they probably had little negative effect on the Ragusan caravan and peddling trade in the Balkans until about 1538, following the advent in Belgrade, in 1532, of two Spanish Jews, and the outbreak of the war of 1537 to 1540 between Venice and the Ottoman 'Ihrks.*®^ The number of Ottoman Jews may have continued to grow until the middle of the 17th century. They constituted the majority of the popula tion of Thessaloniki and were one of the largest ethno-religious minori ties in Constantinople, Bursa, Sofia, Uskiip and Edirne. They fulfilled an important economic function in Egypt, in most of the Balkan and western Anatolian cities, especially in provincial administrative centres, in the Greek and Albanian towns of the Adriatic, in the Black Sea towns, in the Danube river and Black Sea ports, including Akkerman, Caffa (Kefe), Giurgiu, Kilia*°® and later Braila and Galati, and in the towns of the imperial route between Constantinople and Buda by way Belgrade. They were ubiquitous along the three main transversal routes; the Via Egnatia (between Constantinople and Avlona or Durazzo by way of Thes saloniki), the central transversal route between Sofia and Ragusa via Nis and Pristina and the northern transversal route between Spalato (Split) and Belgrade or Nis (by way of Mostar or Travnik and Sarajevo). They were also numerous along the south-north route between Thessaloniki or Serres and Belgrade and Buda by way of LFskiip (Skopje) and Nis, and along the routes linking Wallachia, Moldavia and the Black Sea to Poland, Germany and Hungary. In eastern Anatolia they were fewer in number, and their numbers thinned out yet more in Persia.' There were, however, a thousand Jewish families in 17th-century Kashan, 600 Jewish families in Ispahan, and several Jewish families in the Muslim holy city of Kom, most of whom were said to be descendants of the tribe of Juda.*®^ In yet smaller numbers, they continued to be found in India.


434 GREEK ECONOMIC HISTORY OF THE 15TH TO 19TH CENTURIES
The expansion of woolen cloth manufactures in Italy, the Low Coun tries, England, Germany, Poland and Bohemia during the 16th century was duplicated in the Ottoman Empire at such places as Thessaloniki, Larissa, Trikala, Manisa, Safed, Rhodes and Adrianople, causing Balkan wool prices to rise between 1550 and 1600, at least in port- towns, by 244%. By the last two decades of the 16th century and during the early decades of the 17th, a crisis of overproduction occurred as it became more difficult to find a market for all the goods. To compete against the cloth of Venice and Florence, and of the Dutch and French, and of the cheaper cloth of Thessaloniki, English merchants pursued a tactic of dumping, selling their cloth in Ottoman markets at 20 to 30% below the prevailing price in London. As a result, Ottoman cloth production collapsed or was greatly weakened in many places. A notable exception was Thessaloniki, where it was maintained as little more than a military supply industry.‘“5
Jewish By 1640, millennarianist expectations spread among millenarianism many textile workers and other economically and otherwise despondent populations. The millennarianism affected almost the whole of Europe, from the eastern reaches of Poland to the Netherlands and England, and much of the Mediterranean, from Anatolia and the Balkans to Egypt, Italy and the Maghreb.‘“® It had a basis everywhere in local traditions. It was energised, however, by the merging of two down-phase economic cycles with involvement in foreign and civil wars. The effect of millennarianism in Ottoman towns such as Thessaloniki and Constantinople was to turn the attention of the so-called ‘Spanish Jews’ away from worldly affairs. The effect on a smaller group of Ottoman Jews was quite different, both because they were generally more prosperous and because, known to western Europeans as ‘Portuguese’, ‘Italian’, or ‘Livornese’ Jews, they benefited from their Venetian associations to develop commerce with the Balkan interior during the 17th century by way of the Adriatic port of Spalato.
The displacements By the 18th century, a third of the twenty of the Jewish Venetian companies in the Levant - half a diasporas dozen of them in Aleppo, six in Cairo, three or four in Alexandria, one in Smyrna and one in Constantinople - were in the hands of Venetian Jews.*®’ This reality reflected a continuing westward shift of Jewish centres of population, a reversal of the eastward shift between the 13th and 16th centuries, but also a southward and southeastward shift from Lithuania, Belorussia, Volyn and Austrian Galicia to ‘New Russia’ where they were allowed to
settle as of 1791.'°® The Jewish population of Thessaloniki, Semlin (Zemun), Belgrade, Oskiip and Ragusa declined. That of Venice, Vienna, Trieste, Livorno, Amsterdam, London and Hamburg grew.
Before the mid-17th century, Jews were of negligible numerical signifi cance in Wallachia and Moldavia. By 1825 their number in these principali ties reached 80,000, continuing to grow until the end of the century. The Jewish population of Holland grew from 3,000 in 1650 to 50,000 in 1790. That of Hungary grew from less than 12,000 in 1735 to 75,000 in 1785 to 128,000 in 1805, and to 225,000 in 1825. The trend continued until the end of the century, albeit arrested to some degree by the conversion of many Hungarian Jews to Catholicism."*® Jewish emigration from Poland-Lithuania southeastward to the former Tatar and Ottoman territories conquered by Russia and westward to Ger many, Austria and Hungary had a basis in two important facts: the pull factor of the commercialisation of these zones of attraction and the push fac tor of the Ashkenazic Jewish stem family. The oldest son in a Jewish family could expect to marry and inherit the property of his parents. Younger sons, on the other hand, were expected to seek their fortune. The furtherance by Austria of colonisation and rapid population growth in Hungary, and by Russia in its new southern territories, and the growth of cities everywhere in Europe, drew to them such younger sons. They came as peddlers or, in ' Hungary, to become hazi jido, the overseer of a landlord. When, after 1848, the petty gentry of Hungary lost some of its land to the peasantry, it found comfort in posts of public administration. Jews, on the other hand, obtained the right to own land. As the petty gentry was drawn to a life of conspicu ous consumption, many of them had to sell their land, often to their own hazi jido"’^.
Other Jews made their fortune in trade in the market towns of Hungary. In the town of Arad, for example, the Jews were, in the 1820s, according to Rev. Robert Walsh, ‘the most opulent inhabitants,’ holders of ‘exclusive monopolies of tobacco, corn, and other commodities.’ They had made Arad into a ‘great emporium for commodities,’ embarking upon the Maros (Mures) and taking such goods as timber, firewood, wheat and salt downstream to the Danube and then upstream to different parts of Hungary and Austria, or downstream from the Danube and up the Sava to Croatia."*

This register, and others similar, from one of the rare sources that have survived**®, provide us with a wealth of information on the move ment of goods, commercial centres, business partners, commercial net works. The primary contributors to the establishment of merchants and development of commercial networks**^ were the trade routes, personal contacts - and in consequence transmission and exchange of experience - the policies of the powers involved in trade, general economic condi tions, the position of the Ottoman Empire, particularly following the crisis at the end of the 16th century, the minor and the broader markets of the trade centres or establishments. The Ottoman Empire’s conditions of economic organisation had, from a very early date, enabled Greeks to deal in shipping, and the orientation toward maritime transportation thus opened the way to the ‘discovery’ of maritime markets suitable for the transit trade. Travelling merchants or agents and delegates from commercial enter prises orient themselves to the markets and the fairs, where, until the 18th century, trade in exchange of merchandise is of considerable extent. In this way, in the 18th century, a peak period for Greeks in commerce, circuits of mainland fairs and markets, key trading points were linked together, where the enterprises and their correspondents had their seat, as well as in the riverine and sea ports. It is by now a commonplace that the merchants of the Balkans export ed raw materials and foodstuffs from the Ottoman Empire and its trade centres to Western and Central Europe, importing ores and' elaborated products in general, coins, and moreover, besides merchandise, they also conveyed coins and letters of credit. While the ports of the eastern Italian peninsula had been receiving Greek sailors/shippers since the 15th and
l6th centuries, the markets and fairs of the central Balkans, Transylva nia and Hungary**® attracted itinerant merchants and representatives of corporation or company associates/members. To assess their precise role, it is indispensable to take the policy of the state authorities into account, which was at times favourable to foreigners, Greeks or other, and some times unfavourable; The same is valid for the organisational structure of the economy of the different regions. All these factors contributed to the alteration of entrepreneurial orientation of business. In the grouping or formation that unavoidably follows, it is indispensable to bear in mind the diversifications appearing from one area to another and from one year to another; for example, the semi-autonomous sovereignty of Transylvania, initially subject to payment of tribute to the Sultan, under Hapsburg rule in the 18th century; Hungary, an Ottoman province from 1526 to 1688/1699**®, with a feudal economy, subsequently subjected to a regime of strict control of its trade by the central Austrian administration**’; Austrian policy, dictated by mercantilism and its orientation toward the declaration of free ports (Fiume, Trieste 1719)**®, all constitute the multi form web with the ensuing variations, in the interior itself of the Haps burg monarchy for instance, which accordingly generate either obstacles or facilitations for the merchants. In the same direction, it is reminded that' Venice and the Papal States permitted less free economic, maritime or other development to their subjects, at least until the 18th century (in the case of the ports of Ancona**® and Senigallia*^®). They do not, that is to, say, permit the hatching of conditions enabling these trade centres to compete satisfactorily with those of the Northern Adriatic*^*, Livorno*^^ and Marseille*®®, obliging the observer to bear in mind the trend of French and English commerce, and the privileges or restrictions for foreign mer chants in the diverse places. Equivalent particularities are presented by the trade in Southern Russia from the end of the 18th century*®^, due to the orientation of the economy and the commerce of the region, resulting in the granting of privileges unknown to other regions of the same era, in consequence creating exceptionally competitive situations.
The periodic While the routes of maritime transportation were markets abroad familiar to the Greeks, from the 16th century mainland markets and fairs of the Northern Bal kans and Central Europe became a magnet for the (Ireek and other mer chants of the Balkans. The regime governing Transylvania imposed upon its rulers a policy of protectionism against the Greek merchants, who were in competition with the Saxon urban commercial population.

‘Towns with commercial privileges, such as Sibiu and Brasov battled to conserve them and protect them from the foreign merchants, who handled a substantial portion of imports and exports from Transylvania. In respect however of transportation, they had indubitable exclusivity. The foreigners, on the other hand, attempted to by-pass the limitations posed by the towns’ privileges, by means of various benefits offered to the officials and nobles, who did not, on the one hand, have the-right to deal in trade and, on the other, had the majority in the Diet. Thus, through the decisions of the Diet, a tug-of-war may be observed between the Saxons of the privileged towns and the foreign merchants, Greeks in the great majority, but also Armenians, Jews, as well as Romanians from the Danubian Principalities, Levantines, Serbs, Turks and Bulgarians. The towns’ privileges consisted in collection of dues for participation in trade fairs and warehousing dues (droit d’entrepdt) [...] The trade fairs were a fundamental institution of the Transylvanian economy [...] The right to hold trade fairs, on the basis of a relevant permission by the ruler, belonged to the towns, the nobles and the Church. However, [...] the basic characteristic institution of the Transylva nian town’s economic and social structure was the corporate organisation of the professions’*^^.
The corporate organisation of the towns’ professions, the tense eco nomic relations with the Ottoman Empire, inaccessible to the i Saxons*^®, enabled the ruler to favour Greek and other foreign merchants with privi leges. These were granted to the Greek merchants in 1636 by the ruler Racoczy I, for them to incorporate into a ‘company’, ‘in order for their members to collect the taxes the ruler was in need of, in exchange for his protection to carry out, freely but under certain, albeit onerous terms, transportation trading by Greeks, as well as for them to take part in trade fairs’*^’. Participation in these trade fairs and in the corporation was the aim of Greek merchants from Arvanitochori (near Tyrnovo of Bulgaria), Philippoupolis, Meleniko, Kozani, Serres, Monastir, Moschopolis, loannina, and fewer from Constantinople, Thessaloniki, the Black Sea, Asia Minor, Thessaly‘S®, actively promoting the transit trade. Next to the organised Transylvanian fairs and the transportation trade route to the West, merchandise was also channeled to the commercial markets and fairs of the Hungarian towns. Hungary was also feudal, and the regime of the organisation of trade fairs varied from town to town and from ruler to ruler. Here too there is frequent mention of clashes, from the start of the 17th century, between Greeks and locals, proportional to the benefit targeted and the competition's^. It should be noted that, mainly in Hungary, the term "gdrdg’ applies also to the Serbian Orthodox Christians, and indeed to those who had been established in the Hungarian prov

inces much earlier*®®. Greeks / Griechen thus in some cases had the right ‘to sell their merchandise on Mondays until noon, under an awning or in a shop, while in the street they could trade for a fortnight sub poena f 12’*®*. The privileges granted by Leopold I, and mainly, the Treaty of Passarowitz, favourably regulated trading by Ottoman subjects and con sequently Greeks also, in the countries under the Hapsburg monarchy, as they were obliged to pay customs duty of 3% on merchandise in passage ijetween the two countries*®^, with exemption from further taxes. Their transactions took place principally at the fairs, and specialised - also on the basis of their privileges - in the trade of ‘Turkish’ products, under prohibition to export metal ores and money. The itinerant merchants*®® supplied the rural population, whose treatment of them provoked fewer problems. The conduct of trade, however, was not unobstructed for such as were established in the towns, beause they faced difficulties in obtain ing permits to sell in shops and markets/bazaars*®^. Austrian policy in regard to the foreign merchants - especially Otto man subjects and hence the Greeks - was dictated by the need to establish trade with the Ottoman Empire. Ottoman subjects had experience of the routes, the methods and techniques of production and, above all, of the local markets, being acquainted with producers and local merchants, hav ing direct relations with the production within the corporation framework (particularly the Epirots and Macedonians) and were thus indispensable to Austria’s policy, which intended to penetrate the Balkan markets. As long as this stage of quest and adaptation lasted during the 18th cen tury, it was expressed in the policy of attracting foreign merchants.*®® An equivalent policy prevailed besides more or less in all trade centres, when they were in course of development, Livorno, Aquilea*®®, Senigallia, Ancona, Egypt and, most of all. Southern Russia*®’, where at the end of the 18th century a series of decrees targeted the inducement of Greeks, principally from the Aegean Islands, to settle in Odessa, with exemption from taxes and military service and with rights to purchase land and properties. The positive attitude toward foreigners of this policy was on occasion adulterated by a tendency to place foreigners - mainly the Ottoman subjects — on an equal footing with the local inhabitants (Austri ans*®®, Hungarians, Transylvanian inhabitants, Russians et aO, according to the course taken by the economy of the host country. In this way, in about the 1770s, in Austria, Hungary*®®, Transylvania, Livorno, after 1830 in Southern Russia*^® and similarly in Marseille, a reduction is observed in the policy of granting privileges to foreigners. With various limitations of tax exemptions, with the right to trade in products other than Ottoman,

as well as the right to huy land and acquire titles of nohility*^*, the way was open for the incorporation and the placing on a par of the Greeks too in local and international circuits of markets and insurance and banking activities.
The Italian In contrast to the mainland trade fairs of Central Europe fairs (Austria, Hungary, Transylvania, Wallachia)*^^ governed by regimes of varying restrictions, frequently interwoven with the function of the market in feudal regimes, the coastal fairs of the Italian peninsula (Recanati, Fano, Senigallia)*^® on the route of the transit trade to the central Italian peninsula and Central Europe enjoyed excep tional freedoms. In the 18th century particularly, a policy of free ports prevailed (Trieste, Fiume, Ancona), and consequently also of free fairs. Privileged tax exemptions, exemption from the consumption tax in the town-ports, docking facilities, also for warehousing of products destined for overland or maritime transportation, attracted increasing interest on the part of merchants from the Eastern Mediterranean. While the condi tions prevalent in free ports such as Ancona or Trieste. facilitated the establishment of merchants, the temporary freedom of fairs such as Senigallia’s offered, in a very short time-span (about a fortnight in the sum mer months), the opportunity for commercial contacts, mercantile and currency exchange profits, without the expense incurred by the mainte nance of a permanent commercial office. The merchants displayed their wares on stalls in the open, on the banks of the canal or in small shops leased from the town authorities or private individuals.*^® Transactions were effected directly in kind or cash, agreements were concluded for the next year or for the course of the current year, but as a rule nq^records were kept of the transactions. Only a few minor sections of private com mercial archives*^®, or public records kept for taxation purposes^’ provide indirect, albeit valuable information on the significance of these fairs. Their significance is evidenced by the additional fact that they were attended by merchants from near-by ports (Ancona, Venice, Trieke, Fiume, Spalato) as well as from the Eastern Mediterranean and Central European countries, since the range of these fairs was not merely regional but directed at the Mediterranean market in its broader sense.
The networks While early mercantile movement of the 15th to 17th centuries was dictated by exchanges and transactions between two points, and a voyage to a port or trade market was followed by a return trip, the broadening and internationalisation of the market
gradually brought about commercial networks, and Greek merchants par ticipated in them during the lengthy period scrutinised herein. These jjetworks developed gradually and are characterised by the serial estab lishment of merchants, the links of the chain usually constituted by memjjers of the same family, or travelling company associates, commercial agents, transporters-, assisted by commissionaires and consuls. If a group ing of these networks is wished, for the 18th century also, at least for the commercial sector their operations may schematically be represented as follows: a) in Southeastern Europe, tending to extend from south to north and to Central Europe; b) in the Mediterranean on the axes of the Aege an and the Adriatic, and of the Aegean and the Black Sea with the Western Mediterranean, tending to expand toward Amsterdam and, from the second decade of the 19th century, toward England. Finally, the evo lution of trade, and mainly of the banking and insurance concerns, led to the establishment of the complex mixed land and sea trade functioning from the start of the 19th century onward.
‘The Hadjimichail brothers [end of the 18th century]’, in the words of G.G. LaiosU®, ‘had organised their import-export trade from their seat in Siatista and, from 1750 onward, a second seat in Vienna. They collaborated with merchants arid agents of every nationality and religion, travelled to the major trade fairs, where they respectively supplied or procured oriental com modities, mainly European raw materials and industrial products generally, conducted commercial exchanges in European Turkey from Belgrade, Nig and Velessa as far as Larissa, Lamia and Livadeia, and from Durrazzo and ' Elbasan as far as Thessaloniki, Serres, Constantinople and Smyrna. Their enterprises in Europe reached from Budapest and Vienna to Leipzig and further north to Amsterdam in Holland [...] In 1783 Pavlos Hadjimichail, with his! family, settled in Vienna [..] following strenuous efforts, acquiring the privilege to hold a weekly free commercial market and an annual trade fair in the country town of Torbk Becse in Hungary’.’^®
This example is only one sample of the extent of range of the first network, incorporating merchants from Thessaly, Epirus, Macedonia, transporting the products of their handicraft industries, tobacco and raw materials for the weaving manufactures of Central Europe (as was the case of the Ampelakia corporation, focused on the processing and dyeing of cotton yarn and its almost exclusive exports to Central Europe, along a mercantile-handicrafts network reaching as far as Leipzig and Northern Europe).

Vienna, Bucharest, Bragov, Sibiu, Livorno, Florence, concurrently with contacts with Ali Pa§a within the framework of collaboration with the ruling powers. The phenomenon is also found in the colonies where (in Trieste and Livorno, for instance) in the course of their brief occupation by the French, a great portion of the Greek merchants sides with the Aus trian regime, ardently desiring the restoration of Austrian administration, despite the apparently ‘democratic’ orientation of some of them.‘®‘
‘The Manikatis family, surnamed Safranou, natives of Meleniko and established in Sibiu toward the mid-18th century, founded a renowned com mercial house. Its commercial network (which included Sibiu, Bragov, Cluj, Temesuar, Pest, Vienna, Leipzig, Hamburg, Trieste, Venice, Constantinople, Bursa, Iasi, Moscow) was based on relatives and friends who had departed at different times from the same regions as the Manikatis’.’^^
Examples are not exhausted by these few instances. Of course Greeks, Serbs, Vlachs from all the regions of Epirus, Macedonia and Serbia inte grated in this network, either in collaboration or collision in the com munitarian and commercial sector, preparing for the course to social, cultural and national identity consciousness. Collaboration with other national-religious groups, Armenians, Jews, Germans, is rarer until the end of the 18th century, and especially among those who remain Ottoman subjects despite the intermarriages noted. Collaboration ensues at a later date, particularly from the early 19th century. The maritime network, of oldest date and most familiar to Greeks, did not comprise only the better known ports of the Adriatic and Western Mediterranean, the Aegean Islands, the Asia Minor and Peloponnesian littorals, but tended equally to a mixed ramification to mainland trading, particularly through the Epirot merchants. Epirots take part in the transit trade with products (e.g. honey, fabrics, skins) even from Central Europe (Poland, Germany, Chechia, Danubian Principalities) directed to the port of Arta and thence channelled to Venice, Trieste, Ancona, Marseille.*®^ The network of commercial interrelations of the colonies at the Medi terranean ports may be distinguished into four directions: 1) that of the Eastern Mediterranean and in particular of the Aegean with the Adriatic Seas: instances of the ‘colonists’ (paroiki) of Venice, Trieste, Ancona*®^ with Constantinople, Smyrna, Chios, Crete, the Aegean Islands, as basic centres of collaboration, especially as commercial trans-shipment points, the Ionian Islands, the coasts of the Peloponnese, Continental Greece and Epirus; 2) of the Eastern Mediterranean, of the Ionian Islands with the Western Mediterranean (instances of Livorno, Marseille*®®).ij^rom the end of the 18th century, the port constituting the point of reference for all
jylediterranean diaspora centres is Smyrna*®®; 3) of the broader Mediter ranean network into which, from the end of the 18th century, the comjnunities in Ukraine*®^ and the Black Sea*®® penetrated and to which from the early 19th century the colonies of Egypt*®® were linked: the wheat*®® and cotton*®* trades, next to the broadening sphere of speculative bankjng interests, contribute to' the expansion of the network to London; 4) the mixed network with commercial interrelations of the littoral centres with Southeastern and Central Europe. The map ‘Commercial centres of the business dealings of the company Androulakis, Tabiskos and Co. (1801)’*®^ illustrates indicatively one only of these expanded networks. The instance of Livorno presents a corresponding picture where, in the period from 1808 to 1815, Greek houses of commerce at the town, mainly of Chiot origin, have commercial contacts with Smyrna, Constantinople, Zakynthos, Corfu, the Peloponnese, Venice, Trieste, Ancona, Vienna, Milan, Rome, Piacenza, Naples.*®® The case of the Zizinia family’s transposition and ramifications, from 1734 (from Galatas, Constantinople), to Smyrna and Marseille (1816), and then on to Trieste and Odessa, until its spectacular expansion in Alexandria (1820)*®^ is not a particularly rare example of the commercial interconnections of the period. Possibly the most impressive network of all, which was to predominate for virtually the entire 19th century in the European overseas and mainland banking markets, was that of the Chiots*®®, with main bases on the Black Sea, Trieste, Marseille, Alex andria, Livorno, Syros, with exceptional expansion to London after 1820. Following the redispositions brought about in the course of the Greek War of Independence, when mainly Chiot refugees founded Hermoupolis on Syros, this island came to be included among the hitnerto known crossroads of interconnection of Greeks of the diaspora.*®® Merchants either remain in the diaspora communities or return to Greece*®^ adding Hermoupolis in Syros to the network of their commercial travelling and to their business centres, following the loss of Chios and the Smyrna crisis, as the centre for the orientation of their trade to the Eastern Mediter ranean.
From the circuits of local buying and selling, the commercial networks evolve into broader networks of credit dealing. The Greeks, familiar with the local market in their native lands, successful in advance purchases of products, were in a position to influence cultivation and production according to the demands of the market, and to compete with the Western European merchants. Domination in the maritime circles and the family
organisation of the enterprises facilitated direct communication, speedy collection of information and execution of decisions.

Commercial ‘The availability of raw-material surpluses - wool, cheese practices skins - and craft products, the migratory habits of the men and their intimate knowledge of the difficult routes [...] finally persuaded a portion of the pastoral folk to become carriers and traders of goods’ is the laconic observation of Trajan Stoianovich'®® in refer ence to the Macedonian, Thessalian and Epirot conveyors of the 17th cen tury and onward, adding: ‘A very large portion of the merchants of the Danube-Tisza-Mureg-Sava-Kupa zone of commerce began their commercial careers as muleteers. The thriftier and more enterprising muleteers became forwarding agents, and the forwarding agents who made good began to import and export on their own account. Finally, most forwarding agents and import-export merchants engaged, at least occasionally, in moneylend ing. A few of the moneylenders became bankers of more than just local renown.’’®®
This comprehensive depiction shows the evolution of the represen tatives of the mercantile profession in certain areas and in the span of a single generation. While on land the muleteers became established merchants, in the maritime trade, captains of cargo vessels evolved into established merchants with partnerships in companies, shipowners, insur ance agents, bankers.
The itinerant It must be stressed from the beginning that this evolumerchants tion did not take place at the same rhythm, at the same time nor in the same areas. The reasons do not always relate to the personality of the merchant themselves but also to the particular conditions prevailing in the areas of trade and reception. The evolution of the same person in the diverse forms of commercial practice did not necessarily signify also the complete abandonment of former practices; merchants-company associates, for instance continued to visit fairs, to journey from town to town of the Balkans, targeting profitable purchases and promoting profitable sales. Filves”® classifies the Greek merchants as; itinerants supplying the rural population, those established in the territory and the carriers of merchandise. Their journeying fre quently lasted for months or a year, as the same merchant visited several markets successively, or stayed temporarily in trade centres, seeking inex pensive purchases, suitable cargoes etc. The developments of commercial practices in the 18th century could not be covered by itinerant or travelling merchants; in any case, the policy applied by each country in order to attract foreign merchants favoured, as has been seen, the more permanent establishment of diaspora merchants.

While wholesale merchants (negozianti), because of their role in the devel opment of the economy, have left visible evidence of the part they played, nevertheless next to them numerous merchants of minor status were active jji every colony, as were other factors of commerce and handicrafts, linked in the orbit of long-distance trade. These are: ‘the “small” merchant, handling minor or local trade, that is .locally buying and selling merchandise, not wholesale as do the great merchants but in retail’’”; the bottegai^’’’^, itinerant or per manently established in a market where they open a ‘shop’ (bottega = general store); the ‘artisans’, on occasion regarded with suspicion (e.g. in Hungary’”* and in Transylvania’”), supplying the local mar ket, or anyway oriented to it. There exists between the major and the minor merchants of the diaspora communities a ‘relationship of complementation’. The minor merchants play an important role in the operation of the enterprises of the great Greek merchants, ‘serving as intermediaries between the large-scale wholesalers and the local populations.’”^
Commercial A supplementary and complementary role was played in personnel the affairs of the wholesalers by the following: ‘Commis sionaire (paraggelmatias): he who accepts orders for advance purchases of merchandise, and having made the purchase, forwards it to the commissioner accompanied by the accounts for their bill of purchase (fatturd), drawing on cash or awaiting a transfer of payment [...] Supplier (provisionarios): he who receives merchandise forwarded to him by others, to sell for his own account, and upon their sale has the right to his commission plus expenses [...] Agent iagentis): he who, in the absence of the wholesaler or commis sionaire, acts according to instructions received from them for advance pur chases of merchandise. Such agents for account of the major commissionaires in Europe live where the manufactures are located and to whom from time to time they pass on the orders received from the commissionaires, agreeing the prices of the merchandise and the delivery deadline which, upon receipt they forward to the commissionaires, drawing on their credit for assembly of the merchandise, expenses and their commission [...] Expediter (speditoros): resident in a coastal town or any other place, or receiving merchandise forwarded by a commissionaire or wholesaler, for trans-shipment or further forwarding, following the instructions he is given, agreeing on the expenses incurred by the merchandise and his commission, either with those from whom he receives the order or with those to whom he forwards the goods [...] Shipper (karikatoros): sent by a wholesaler or commissionaire to a coastal town or any place, to receive and lade a single consignment or, being resident

Until the 19th century the number of such brokers was fixed and had in fact a stable representation by local merchants, Jews,Greeks and others.*’’ In regard to products of the Orient, the role of broker was frequently undertaken by Greeks with Austrian nationality, in prepara tion in fact for the role of negoziante. Closely linked to the profession of merchant of long-distance trading was the position of secretary iscrivano), an experienced employee responsible for commercial correspondence.*’® The reliability required by the position, as, well as experience of the market, were suitable equipment for the evolution of a secretary to the stage of negoziante In relation to other professions, their numbers increased as commerce expanded, multiplying the number of wholesalers, and double-entry book-keeping*®**, demanding specialised knowledge. In Trieste thus, in 1780, 15 wholesalers, 35 minor merchants and 5 secretaries are mentioned, while in 1818 there are 93 wholesalers, 10 dealers (a variant of the wholesaler, dealing on a lesser scale and range, in local and export trading), 67 minor merchants and 79 secretaries.*®* Wine merchants, coffee-shop owners, numerous garzoni di bottega completed the profiles of the commercial professions. ^
The wholesalers The field of commercial activities, however, in which the Greeks of the diaspora were distin guished, was that of the wholesale merchcLnts/negozianti/Grosshdndler. From an early date, in the 17th century already, the conspicuous presence of Greeks in Venice*®*^ enables us to distinguish the principal characteristics of the organisation of commercial enterprises, which may be summarized as follows; a) collaboration on a form of partnership with family members; extension of the family was achieved by intermarriage with financial orientation; b) establishing a company network from the merchants’ place of origin to the centres of the diaspora and other key trading points of the Eastern Mediterranean, Central and Western Europe, positioning per manent or temporary commercial agents, shippers, or in collaboration with wholesale importers and exporters in Greek territory. With the addi
• nal assistance of other merchants and commercial brokers, the direct
xchange of merchandise with the trading houses of the diaspora was
Ssured.‘«^
The firms From the 17th century on, and particularly in the 18th, the commerce of Mediterranean dimensions is organised on the basis of commercial firms. Private commercial societies, societies in accomandita, corporations (Negozio all’ingrosso in conto compagnid), ‘companias’ (companies) of the Bragov and Sibiu type, shareholding firms (main ly in insurance and shipownership), banking, stockbrokers’ offices. In the giniple private companies, as well as the later composite firms, partners were members of the same family*®^ (father and son, brothers, uncle and nephews, father-in-law and son-in-law). Intermarriage among the power ful commercial families, either of the same family network (e.g. the case of the Chiots*®®) or, to a lesser extent, also with representatives of other powerful ethnic groups (as in the typical example of the Peloponnesian Demetrios Carccioti, agent in Trieste in 1776 for a commercial house of Smyrna, who later evolved into a negoziante and expanded his business following his marriage to Maria Yoinovic, daughter of a major Serb com mercial family'®®), as well as godfather or best man relationships*®’ permit ted commercial operations and information to be preserved within the same narrow or broader family circle, to maintain links with the local market, to inherit experience, to conserve craft secrets. In the absence of available or suitable family members, compatriots frequently filled or complemented the deficiency. This constituted the rule mainly for the Austrian, Hungarian and Russian colonies, verified by the example of the merchants from Siatista in Vienna or Kecskemet*®®, of the Moschopolitans in Miskolc, the Epirots - mainly from loannina - earlier in Venice, of the Greeks in Bragov and Sibiu, and others. A common geographical origin often ensured the same advantages as family kinship, and possibly provided greater flexibility in the forming and re-constituting of companies without obligations of inheritance. The prerequisite for the formation of a company was the deposit of a capital, which could consist of a) merchandise stored in the partners’ warehouses, ready for sale, or already forwarded, or ordered and in the hands of others; b) credits with merchants of the markets with which they had dealings; c) bills of exchange; d) cash reserves, more rarely; e) a share in the value of ships in their ownership; f) property values, and, g) shares in insurance companies where they were shareholders and when permitted by the partnership contract.*®®

The companies were formed on the basis of a specific agreement, corporate or of partnership*®®, defining the duration of the company, the capital, the obligations of the partners. The duration foreseen did not usually exceed 9 years. The short time-span facilitated clarification of profit and loss, investment of profits and renewal of the companies, with the objective of increasing or reducing capital, expanding the business with new partnerships, inclusion of fresh markets, modification of the directors of the formation of the company.*®* Dissolution of the company prior to the time foreseen by the contract could occur upon the decease of the principal capital shareholder, or upon his wish for re-adaptation of the partnership’s conduct of business. Companies submitted their agree ments for approval to the appropriate commercial courts*®^, who verified the legality of their operation and protected the partners in the case of litigation or irregularities. In areas such as Transylvania and Hungary principally, initial opera tion over a lengthy period was not easy, neither for individual merchants nor for simple private companies. The medieval nature of the function of their economies, the privileges of certain groups of inhabitants (nobles in Hungary, or Saxons, e.g., in Transylvania) led to the establishment — with the tolerance and approval of the authorities - of what were known as ‘companias'. In Transylvania, mainly in Bragov and Sibiu*®®, they were incorporations of Greeks as well as of other merchants and commercial firms, to which privileges were granted (1636) by the ruler of Transyl vania George Rakoczy I, renewed in 1701 by the emperor Leopold I and ‘instituting an exceptional legal right (ius singulare), [...] defining: 1) their commercial activity; 2) their self-administration; 3) the juridisction of their incorporations (ius indicandi)}^'^ Company associates were ‘Romaioi dealers’ (romaioi pragmateftes). There is mention in the privileges of: ‘com munity’ (communitas) or ‘society’ (societas) of the Greek merchants;, (Graecoruni Quaestorum excercentium or negotiatorumy^^. The company members ‘had the right to conduct trade (wholesale or retail) in Transylvania in every kind of product of every provenance only at the trade fairs and only for the duration of the three last days before their dissolution or termina tion’ (1636 privileges)*®®. The 1701 privileges granted them the right to wholesale and retail trading both at the trade fairs ‘as well as outside them, in towns, villages, forts, where they could have shops.’ They were thus protected from abuse by the nobles, administrative officials, Sax ons and others. The ruler ensured the collection of taxes, finding which was the responsibility of the administrative agencies of the ‘compania’, distributing the financial burden among its associates, in this way also
^g^r^CE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL 449
taking advantage of the experience of the merchants from the developjjjg commerce in the Balkans. The ‘compania’ members were Ottoman nationals but subjects of the ruler - subsequently of the Austrian emperor _ residents in Transylvania and were not itinerants - who also conducted trade but were domiciled in Ottoman territory*®’. The ‘compania’ was a professional body and not a’commercial firm, ‘for it was not formed with owned capital nor conducted trade and generally had an entirely different purpose’ (from the commercial firms of Western Europe of the 16th to I8th centuries, such as the Levant Company and others)*®®. In the course of time its administrative structure from a special body of elected members acquired the character of a communitarian organisation attending, as did the other communities, to founding churches or operating schools. The ‘Kriterion’ (the compania’s judicial body) decided the buying and selling of merchandise, the contracts with firms/‘guilds’ of limited or unlimited duration among the ‘compania’ members, contracting loans, guarantees (‘kefilimes') and stocks of supply, also regulating payment for labour (of apprentices, employees, servants)*®®. Privileges were in any case enjoyed by a limited number of merchants. Of the 285 merchants, Ottoman sub jects, registered by Transylvania’s regional administration in 1702, only 127 were members of the ‘compania’: 102 of these were in Sibiu and 20 in Bra§ov^®®. It is assumed that a large part of Greeks from the Ottoman Empire traded illegally, and there were consequently numerous instances of complaints on the part of local inhabitants and the authorities. The privileged regime of the ‘companias’ changed within the framework of Maria Theresa’s policy (with the 1777 privileges)^®* for the protection of Austrian merchants, especially following the Sened of the Ottoman Porte (24 November 1784), permitting the free transportation to and from the Ottoman provinces by river and sea.^®^ Gradually, only individual merchants finally remained in Transylvania, or such as had managed to integrate in the circuits of international commercial exchanges. Similar ‘companias’, albeit on a minor scale, also had operations in the commercial centre-towns of Hungary. According to the incomplete census drawn up by the Hungarian authorities in 1754 of the Balkan merchants Ottoman subjects, out of 1167 a mere 62 were members of some of the ‘companias’^®®, scattered around the broaid vinicultural and wine producing region: Tokaj, Miskolc, Gyongyds or the stock-raising regions of Dioszeg, Kecskemet, Novi Sad. Each ‘compania’ had its particularity^®^. Their common starting point was the attempt to enjoy certain exemptions and the right to self-admin istration. Most ‘companias’ began operations from the early 18th century


450 GREEK ECONOMIC HISTORY OF THE 15TH TO 19TH CENTURIES
upon the expansion of Southeastern European trading, while the flour ishing Miskolc ‘compania’ appears to have existed already in 1685^°®. Its members originated from Moschopolis, Macedonia (Kastoria, Monastic, Siatista and elsewhere), and specialised in the wine trade among Poland, Hungary and Ukraine. The earliest surviving statutes relating to the ‘companias’ operation regulate relations with apprentices and their behaviour in general (as defined in the 1735 internal regulation)^®®. Later decisions arrived at in the General Assembly led to development of the statute of the ‘compania’ which, besides matters of commercial discipline, regulated issues of self-determination, similar to those found in the statutes of the other communities of the diaspora.
A document provides information on a first simplistic form of the con stitution of such a ‘compania’, whereby 8 corporate companies (dealers with their comrades) originating from Kozani formed a ‘compania’ in Kecskemet in 1708: ‘for our own good and salvation to have as first principle to listen to one another for the best to ourselves’; if ‘on whatever road we may travel,’ it should chance that ‘a carriage have an accident [...] whoever should happen to be there and does not take measures, if being a pasha giving florins 24 and if a lad, giving florins 12, he should be beaten 12 blows; and whoever swears with profanity should have to answer to the braves and whoever falls asleep on the journey to have to pay florins 6; and whatever lad should leave his pasha must pay florins 12 as paskalikia; [...] and whoever has no companion and finds one amongst us, that is well; and if he takes on a stranger must pay florins 50 to the ‘compania’ This document, as well as one of a later date (1715)^“® concerned corporate company regulations and prepared (1721) the drawing up of a written agreement with the Kecskemet municipal authority, following upon the intervention of the local landowner Count Stephan Kohdri^®®.
On studying other Hungarian ‘companias’^'®, differences are found from those of Transylvania, in that they are rather corporate companies of broad extent, under strict organisational control. Besides, in the develop ing policy of placing Ottoman and Austrian subjects on a par, the obliga tion, from 1774, for any who wished to trade in Hungarian products, to swear the Hungarian oath of fidelity and settle their families permanently in Hungary, the road was further opened for wholesale merchants and firms with multiple associates, principally those in accomandita: it was the latter^'* that marked the capitalistic development of the Greeks of the diaspora. They continued to be personal and not shareholder firms, their members were usually relatives, but partners were distinguished into ‘sleeping’ and manifest partners. ‘Sleeping partners’ were the main capital holders, with participation in more than one company. When independent
^plvt^^CE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL 451
jjjerchants had accumulated surplus capital, they formed partnerships ^ith other merchants, newly emerged or experienced, who at some point ^ere in need of fhnds. They frequently maintained their personal comjnercial affairs. Their founding and operation and their statutes remained those familiar from the simple personal companies; one of the partners, generally the ‘front man’, made the company known in the market by signing and circulating ‘circular letters’ (circolariy^"^. These firms were characterised by a broader geographic expansion, gradual decentralization and, above all, flexibility in the entrepreneurial policy of company busi ness conducted. Partnerships also with non-compatriot merchants^*® or merchants whose seat was in other trade centres (Livorno-Alexandria^*^; Trieste-Smyrna; Trieste-Vienna; Livorno-Trieste-London or elsewhere^*®) expanded the horizons of business and facilitated decision taking. To be able to compete with the major Western capitalist businessmen, they adopted commercial entrepreneurial strategies resulting in the increase of the capital in circulation and encouraged profitability by the tactic of commercial credits.^'® Through the broadening of the family networks of their companies, they minimised the role of intervention of intermediaries and kept in more direct contact with the production^", through agents and representatives, either travelling or settled in the production centres. By founding and expanding their companies in the strategic European centres, they competed with Western European merchants in the Eastern Mediterranean markets. As the majority of the diaspora communities survived the crisis of the French wars, many of them entered into a period of re-adaptation or prosperity, integrated, after 1815, in a phase of activities of crucial signifi cance, in banking, shipownership, insurance, and with a range extend ing well beyond the Mediterranean and even Russia, reaching London^*® and, gradually, to the New World. From commissionaires (on commissioni) and shippers (in spedizioni), they advanced to assessments and arbitrage (speculazioni/arbitrii) and discounts of bills of exchange (sconti in piazza), in business of a purely banking nature.^^®

Three years before his death, he was ennobled. His son, Baron

Georg S. Sina inherited the affairs of the family bank, obtaining control of a large share of the wool, cotton and tobacco import and export trade of Austria and Hungary.’
There is also the eloquent Treatise by a patriotic Greek on the situation of Greeks (Graikoi) living in Odessa in the year 1816 {AiarpiPfi <ptAoyevoOg Tivog rpaixou mp( rfjg xaxaoTaaeiog xcbv iv ’Odrjaacp oixouvrcov FpaixC))/ xaxd TO sTog 1816): ‘The Franks (Frangoi), being educated and wise, for they were born and brought up where there is care for the Muses, had to show a new commercial system to the Inexperienced Greeks of Odessa, who, sensitive as to their honour, were, by good fortune, touched therein by the spirit in which it was agreed that the attempt was undertaken, in the words wherein it was couched by the Franks, led them make their decision in the second instance, and instantly of themselves to put the system into practice, which they named the “Odessa Commercial Fund”, whose purpose is to grant loans on interest to dealers to enable them to defray their debts.’ In s the same year they had also founded the ‘Commercial Loans Coffer (Banca)’. The ‘Compatriots’ Friend’ continues: ‘A critic of the situation in Odessa, i were he to examine the case more exactly, would learn that commerce is j in the hands of the Greeks, for it is they who attend to it conscientiously | and profitably within the Kingdom, on the one hand proceeding to various speculations, trading and promoting local products and in this way bringing | profits to the inhabitants in the interior of the Kingdom, or protecting the price of the products in Odessa, where they are sold if the price is high and where in consequence the profit remains; in exports, on the other hand, they convey goods to Constantinople and thence further to Italy, France, Spain, wherever most profitable, in such a way that all profits, from wherever they derive, revert again to the local inhabitants, benefiting the state
Insurance Travel, and in particular sea voyages, because of piracy companies and conjunctures of warfare, particularly at the end of the 18th century, were considered increasingly dangerous.^^^ The tendency for activating the surplus capital of the personal companies found its materialisation in the profitable branch of insurance. Ships and merchandise were insured. In particular in the commercial ports of Trieste, Venice, Livorno and Odessa, insurance companies found ed on shareholding capital reached their zenith. Shareholding merchants were thus offered the opportunity to participate in more than one firm, investing, risking, venturing an increase of their capital, yet at the same time contributing to maintaining the calm and stability of the market. Dealing in the insurance sector proved particularly profitable, as may be deduced from the establishment of Greek insurance companies in all the key Mediterranean ports and their broadly based participation in the other insurance firms of the areas in which they were established.
In 1789 the first Societa Greca di Assicurazidne was founded in Trieste (I7gg.[l811?]/1815-1830)^^^ with a share capital of 46 shareholders, who constituted the mdin body at the companies’ general asseniblies of the Board. The nature of the shares as a tradeable title deed explains why a number of shareholders deposited shares in the Greek insurance company (as well as of other firms) as capital in their mercantile enterprises. Their examplU'tvus imitated by other societies/companies with either few or many associates, with wide participation by Greeks, such as the following: Compagnia d’Assicuratori particolari; Stabilimento d’Assicuratori; Amici Assicuratori; Greco Banco d’Assicurazione; Adriatico Banco d’Assicurazioni; Assicurazioni Generali; Riunione Adriatica di Sicurita and others^^L In Livorno correspondingly, Greeks were already participating in the Compagnia d’Assicurazioni marittime^^® in 1788. loannes Drossos Plastaras, of the well-known great merchant family of Trieste, moved there in 1817 and, with Giuseppe Fajani, was director of the Societa Anonima d’Intrepidi Austro-Toscani Assicuratori^^®. Plastaras transferred to Livorno his experience of long date in Trieste, moving in the same entrepreneurial environment.
In Odessa on the Black Sea, the Greeks, together with other merchants and with the favour of the town’s governor Richelieu, founded a joint-stock conipany in 1806, the Camera Imperiale delle Assicurazioni^^’. ‘When the Greeks of Odessa were invited to take part in this system, it happened, for their good fortune, that they were displeased by certain things said by the Franks so that, touched on a point of honour, they decided on the spur of the moment to set up a similar system, and it was no sooner said than done, in 1808, named “Greco-Russian Corporation of Insurance” (rpatxopcoaacxij SuVTpocpia twv ’AacpaXsiFrv), proving by experience to be greatly more worthy and profitable than the first had been In 1817-1818 they formed the Company of United Greek Insurers CExacpeca TCdv ’Hvcopsvcov AacpaAioTixcov rpaixcovY'^^.
The artisans The orientation of Greeks of the diaspora to the for
abroad warding/trading occupations, and in particular to the economic organisation of the towns in which they established themselves (professions formed into crafts in Venice and in their continental communities), or their orientation toward trade in the
ports of Trieste, Livorno, Ancona and Odessa, implied their minor par ticipation in the sector of handicrafts or industry until at least the mid19th century. As was the case in most major ports of the day, the field of
occupations in the handicraft or industrial sector belonged to those who
INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL^


454 GREEK ECONOMIC HISTORY OF THE 15TH TO 19TH CENTURIES
processed raw materials and subsequently exported the finished product. In this way, among the pioneers in the crafts of tailors, tanners, shoemak ers, and especially the cape-makers {capotat)'^^^ — or, in Venice, painters, silversmiths, engravers - in the 18th century the soap manufactures canae to the fore, whose product was required by the increasing European textile industry^^* and hy the distilleries (fabbriche) of the rosoli liquor232 and, principally, the handicraft industry of red-dyed yarn^®®. Cotton, of which yarn was mainly made - and in particular the reddyed yarn - was one of the principal exports of the Ottoman Empire, especially from the Greek territories. It has been noted that the devel opment of the Ampelakia corporation at the end of the 18th and the beginning of the 19th centuries is based on the processing and dyeing of yarn, as was the network formed of a mixed type of handicraft and com mercial organisation in the Northern Balkans and Central and Northern Europe, as far as Vienna and Leipzig. The object of the authorities of the European countries with a mercantile organisation was to discover the ‘secret’ of yarn dyeing, known to the Greeks, with view to ‘equipping’ their textile units therewith^®^. Greek dyers become sought after in France (e.g. in Montpellier) as well as in Trieste, Vienna^^^ and Transylvania. The interest in the product and the effort to reduce transportation costs from the Eastern Mediterranean led merchants to collaborate with yarn dyers in a formation unknown to other handicraft production, a ‘fabbrica corporation’^^® permitting to a few merchant-entrepreneurs some marginal, temporary investment in the ‘secondary’ sector of the economy^®’. The field in which, as is well known, production and commerce were combined, both long-lasting and successful, was printing, with the pub lishing houses of Venice and, partially, of Vienna. Merchants in Ven ice, the Saros, Theodossiou and Glykiies, had instituted a commercial company already in the 17th century, with relatives from loannina, and succeeded, thanks to their persistence, in overcoming the obstacles and being accepted in the corporations of printers of Venice, setting up print ing works that became publishing houses, and thus contributing to the revival of scholarship. Books, as a cultural and commercial commodity'^®®, were the object of the interest of Greeks of the diaspora, since, in regard to modern literature at least, sponsors, subscribers^®® and merchants dem onstrated their interest.
Shipping Commercial enterprises frequently expanded^ into shipenterprises ping ventures and ownership or partnerships in vessels, abroad The maritime network particularly, especially the
‘deposit trade’ of wheat from the Black Sea®“ to the Mediterranean ports after 1820, also depended on the capacity of merchants to participate with their own vessels. As Greek shipping developed in the 18th century, principally under Greco-Ottoman, Russian and other flags, the commercial traffic of the colonies was served mainly by Greek-owned ships. In the ports of Trieste^^' and Odessa^^^, according to research conducted to date, the Greeks made progress in developing enterprises of ownership of and partner ship in of vessels. In Trieste, the Austrian shipping policy from 1774 was oriented to reinforcing Austrian shipping, a policy facilitated by the political conditions prevailing after 1784 and particularly following the fall of Venice in 1797. Austrian subjects were enabled to acquire ships, an opportunity gradually and increasingly taken advantage of by the Greeks. Their preference was once more for investing their capital in partnership enterprises (to avoid major risks at sea), in the form of family enterprises and, in fact, in correspondence with their commercial associated com pany enterprises. With the development of steam shipping, expansion of trade, and maritime insurance agencies of long duration and broad extent, shipowning enterprises transferred to London, with Chiots as the main representatives of the network, who developed their business between the Black Sea, Syros, Alexandria, Trieste, Livorno, Marseille and London.
