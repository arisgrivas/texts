They have the economic benefits of the contraction of the favorable monetary policy without the automatic regulation of a country with the politics of Greece 1 K. Kostis, The National Economic Structures of Greece. But while the exchange rate of the drachma against the dollar could be kept at par, the price index knew a continuous rise, to levels much higher than those of the USA, France and England. The end of the war and the restoration of the functioning of the international economy, even in a rudimentary form in relation to the pre-war experience, will prove the fictitiousness of parity. In a few months the foreign exchange reserves will be exhausted and the drachma will begin its devaluation course. Greece will in turn experience the problems of exchange rate instability and the Greek economists, who in 1919 were wondering whether or not there was inflation in Greece, will find that the &quot;health&quot; of a currency does not depend only on maintaining its exchange rate parity at par. Inflation thus makes its appearance in the everyday vocabulary and will be the evil demon of every Minister of Finance, of every government. The following years are characterized by constant exchange rate instability and inflation, which will be continuously fueled by the Greek state&#39;s pursuit of initially responding to the demands of the Asia Minor campaign, then to the needs of rehabilitating refugees and liquidating war expenses28. In the first decade of the century, the incomes realized outside the area of ​​the Greek state constituted a significant reinforcement of the domestic economy and allowed the balancing of the balance of payments. Now after the end of the war, the international situation will adversely affect the Greek economy. Immigrant remittances are decreasing, merchant shipping activity is experiencing a significant decline. Agrarian reform and the rehabilitation of refugees create additional problems and the industrialization of the country is done27. A price index was calculated in Greece, for the first time, in 1923 with a retrospective assessment of its price for the war period. In 1919, the debate, which will occupy many pages of the daily newspaper as well as the economic press, will revolve around the question of the existence or not of inflation in Greece, at the time when the subsequent calculation of the price index showed that their level, at that time, it was 4 times higher than that of 1914. For its part, the Greek government remained at that time with the confidence given to it by maintaining the exchange rate of the drachma at par with the dollar, without taking anything else into account, such as for example, the collapse of the international gold standard and the consequent inability of the gold exchange standard to act as a regulator in Greece, or the much faster increase in the price level in Greece, compared to other countries. 28.

But the power of the drachma was only fictitious. Enthusiasm for the successful operation of the Greek monetary system in a long war period would slowly turn into fear and eventually panic in the face of its inability to respond to the post-war adjustments of the economy 26. Indeed, Greece&#39;s balance of payments remained favorable in throughout the war years. The reasons are many. Immigrant remittances, the extraordinary profits of Greek merchant shipping and the forced contraction of foreign trade due to the world war have already been mentioned. This favorable evolution of the balance resulted in the continuous increase of monetary circulation and in general the supply of money without the gold exchange rule being able to play its automatic regulatory role, even if this is considered possible in a country with 26.

Kostis, The National Bank in Asia Minor (1919-1922), Athens 1984, pp. 79-132. economic structures, the dollar could continue to rise, in years of France and the status of its function in relation to the value of the exchange rate will be exhausted and Greece will exchange rate wondering how the &quot;trade thus the appearance of the demon every Y The years of political instability the pursuit of the micro position of the first ten years in the field of domestic payments.

Relative according to at least the fragmentary information we have, shows all the signs of an increase19, the currency circulation will remain stagnant, or in many cases will decrease20. The same problem, however, is formulated in different terms: at the end of 1909, and while the limit of monetary circulation amounted to 146,776,000 drachmae, the actual circulation amounted to 142,437,000 drachmae, thus creating a constant risk for the banks, something which they themselves did not ignore and constantly repeated21. The economic philology of the time is full of comments and interpretations on the subject of the monetary crisis, which the Greek economy was experiencing, as a result of the lack of means of payment. It is clear that, from a certain point on, it was a significant obstacle for the development of the country&#39;s economic activity. The problem appears even more acute, if it is connected to the seasonal fluctuations of the Greek economy and the consequent great demand for money at the end of the year. and in the sizes given by the D.O.E. The first always mentions 66,000,000 drachmas as its publishing margin, while D.O.E. admits only 65,000,000 drachmas. 19. One should be particularly cautious in characterizing the trends of the Greek economy in the first decade of our century. If the balance of payments figures show a favorable development, our knowledge of the industry e.g. are negligible, while in other sectors such as mining we know that there is a crisis, which does not seem to be unrelated to the appreciation movement of the drachma. The lack of a comprehensive work on the Greek economy at the beginning of our century allows us to make only assumptions about the relationship between the favorable evolution of the balance of payments and the activity of the Greek economy. 20. Our knowledge of the money supply is trivial. Beyond the lack of any work, the problem is directly linked to the minimal information that the banks, with the exception of ETE, provide in their balance sheets. Thus, the Bank of Athens from one point on gives data on its balance sheets only for the totality of deposits and not for the individual categories. However, according to all accounts, or at least those that I have in mind, during these years promissory notes became widely circulated to meet the shortage of liquid money, since check circulation was still in its infancy. More information on this topic see the third chapter, below. 21. A. Spurgitis, op. On the problem of monetary tightness, see the article of the best economic newspaper of the time in Greece, Economic Greece and in particular the pages of 8.3.1908, pp. 121-123, 15.3.1908, pp. 133-134 and 22.3.1908, pp. 149-150 with the title &quot;Some observations on the circulation of money in our country&quot;. See also in the paper of 9.2.1908, the article entitled &quot;The monetary distress&quot;. A lot of material is also found in the annual accounts of the banks and in particular of E.T.E. and the Bank of Athens. 29 THANOS VEREMIS involvement of the Greek state, was commented by Miltiadis Seitanis, in 1878:... in the ranks of the Greek army, for the most part, the man of very moderate intellectual development, apart from a few young knights from the ancient military houses, or volunteers from abroad, who, however, did not all have the required education for the ranks of officers, to whom they were promoted more slowly&quot;. 9 And while the author of these remarks spoke of the &quot;new struggle against the Turks&quot;, 10 the Greek forces of 1877 did not exceed 25,028 men, 11 compared to the approximately 700,000 that the Ottomans deployed in the Russo-Turkish war of 1877. 12 The military reforms of the governments of Koumundourou and Deligiorgi continued at an increasing pace during the Trikoupi administration. Between 1882 and 1886 the School of Hope was reformed, the School of Naval Cadets and the School of Petty Officers were established, officers went abroad (mainly to France) for training, and large purchases of military equipment were made.13 These investments bore fruit in the long term - during the Venikelos administration, 1910-20. In the meantime, the poor state of finances caused the reduction of military expenditure in the budget, from 58,800,000 drachmas in 1885 to 19,700,000 drachmas in 1893.14 The war of 1897 and the turmoil it caused in the officer ranks, the secret struggle of the armed groups in Macedonia and the inability of the politicians to rise to the Balkan challenge, caused the intervention of the army in politics, in 1909. The rise of Eleftherios Venizelos to power owed a lot to the officers of the &quot;Military League&quot;, who invited him as a political advisor and 9 Miltiadis Seizanis, The politics of Greece and the revolution of 1879 in Macedonia, Epirus and Thessaly, Athens, 1879, p. 28. 10 ó.n., o. 27. 11 ibid., p. 29. 12 K.
