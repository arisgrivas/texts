CHAPTER 2
Familiocracy in the Greek Business Elite
Class: Endogamy and Other Cultural Traits
Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries marked an era of uncertainty in the industrial sector in Europe because the transaction costs for a family were relatively low—and as a result—family capitalism prevailed. Additionally, the last decades of the nineteenth century as well as the interwar period have reinforced this tendency.1 The challenges faced by family firms to remain untouched were further resistant in the event of death of the husband who was the founder of the company. In the absence of male heirs, those who took over the management of the firm were the wives, or the daughters of the deceased. Regarding the case of German female entrepreneurs, bereavement played a major role. However, the core of their motives was to financially stabilize and protect the existence, or the well-being of their family.2 In England, women thrived in several commercial sectors

such as in retailing, in money lending, and in carrier business.3 Women’s abilities to become successful entrepreneurs were acknowledged after 1970s, as before this decade, their business initiatives were scarce and strictly confined to their family’s trading network. It was after 1970s when female entrepreneurs found easy access to their innovative steps outside family and these steps stimulated the international economic prosperity.4 In Greece, family constituted a solid part in the business networks as the firm family bonds formed the fundamental economic and political base of society. The present state of the art in the field includes the works of Ioanna Pepelasis (2007, 2010)5 who explored family bonds and women’s participation in Greek capitalist milieu.6 Other scholars such as Olympia Selekou (1998)7 and Elpida Vogli (2010),8 studied the business elite families in Greece focusing on their members as a whole. A broad-scale research has also been conducted on the common characteristics that defined the formation of business networks as well as family bonds of the Greek communities outside Greece. These are the works of Patricia Herlihy (1979),9

Gelina Harlafti (1993),10 Anna Mandylara (2000)11, and Maria-Christina Chatziioannou (2009).12 Additionally, Despoina Vlami (2006)13 emphasizes on middle-class women of the trading clan based in Livorno, probing on their social status and life. What remains under-researched though is the study of female contribution in family-managed businesses viewed from a feminist standpoint because female agency faced social constraints, and this side was largely ignored by feminist historians. Also, the real motives behind female economic agency remain unexplored. The present chapter attempts to explore the following issues and questions raised: What was the real female contribution to the Greek capitalist family? Was women’s participation acknowledged, or ignored? How did familiocracy serve commercial plans? How well-aware were the elite ladies of the significance of their roles as mothers and spouses as well as of their social visibility as business partners? During the first five formative decades (1830s to 1880s) that marked the creation of the Greek state and the appearance of the first feminist movements, the legal status of Greek women did not change much and remained virtually unchallenged. The first collective efforts emerged from the urban petite-bourgeoisie and professional middle classes—chiefly the schoolteachers—while the Greek feminists struggled for equal opportunities for women’s education and civil rights. In an effort to get synchronized with the challenges of the Western world and in order to expel—at the same time—the Ottoman legacy, the Greek women took up a pivotal role in shaping ethnic identity and national ‘viability’.14 However, a number of authors, journalists, and educators argued that women had to stay

at home and get busy with their household duties and with the rearing of their children only, while others advocated the view that women should go out and work in order to contribute to the family’s finances. Both sides referred to urban women because villagers always labored hard both in the fields and at home while their contribution was taken for granted. The journalist Vlasis Gavriilides described upper middle-class Greek women as ‘miserable creatures’. More precisely, he wrote that they lived a ‘false’ life, also ‘hypocritical’, ‘purposeless’, and ‘meaningless’, and that through marriage they sought a goal in life. He contended that they entered into marriage as the representatives of the female gender and not as equal future assistants to men, or as those who had the same ‘capital’ of feelings, senses, work, and individuality as their husbands.15 In the battle for women’s claiming more rights, the feminist journals were the tools in women’s hands to serve the purpose. For instance, Vosporis emphasized on the significance of women’s social contribution, a side of which was exercising charity, while the other was the respectful role in the family that female gender held as mothers and spouses while education was a strong asset for them, too. In this context, Vosporis, reflecting the conservative side of female presence, stressed the point that women should be engaged in jobs that ‘fit to female nature’ only, arguing that they should not claim economic independence and autonomy.16 Evrydiki (1870–1873)—another feminist journal—voiced the arguments of the educated women who argued that education was an imperative demand for women’s emancipation.17 In terms of women’s employment, a common female occupation was that of the maid while literate women were working as schoolteachers at the turn of the nineteenth century. At the dawn of the twentieth century and until mid-century, the number of waged female employment steadily rose, while the period was marked by women’s entrance in the

civil sector employed as civil servants.18 However, the hot debates that started since the decade of 1850s and went on until 1930s revealed the slow-moving and backward character of Greek society. Regarding business, the act of transferring the management of an industrial plant to a female member of a business elite family was complex. It was associated with both the right to family property, which depended on the legislation of that time and gendered perceptions related to bourgeois women’s occupation outside the house. Throughout the nineteenth to early twentieth centuries, the notion that women had to stay at home and look after their kids was deeply seated in the Greek society. Women’s dominion was their household which belonged to the private sphere while there was a firm belief that men were engaged in affairs of the public socioeconomic sphere. The prevailing social tenet viewed home as women’s territory that needed its own economy and management that only women were able to manage and help it reach the height of its great destination. In this context, any external protection and help given by men was fruitless and futile. At home, the more literate mothers and wives were responsible for cultivating high and noble virtues since in the family there was a need for good taste, good psychology, as well as pedagogy and knowledge. Therefore, family was the primary and early stage in the social cell in which the social body was shaped and educated. It was also the core of female expression and the center of action.19 Women of the upper middle classes were not supposed to work. Conversely, the female citizens of the lower classes were active participants in the labor market, being mainly employed as factory workers. In this context and in line with the moral and social code which dictated that the family was the center of all aspects of life and the core of all decision-taking issues, most of factories and industrial plants in the port of Piraeus, as well as in other Greek regions, were family-based enterprises. They passed on to sons after the father’s death who was the founder of the company, or after his retirement. What differentiated the priorities of the male successors with the past, was the belief that they first had to study at university and then to take over the management of the firm because in

the past years their ancestors became apprentices in their parents’ business without pursuing higher studies. Moreover, male kinship was the beneficiary of family’s legacy for managing the company while nothing seemed to break the chain of these tightly knit family business networks. Some examples of family-based thriving companies in the Greek principal port were the cases—among others—of iron industry and machining factory that was founded in 1859 (or 1860) by G. Vasileiades. In 1901 it was taken over by his son V. Vasileiades. As a rule, the senior brothers usually undertook the management of the family firm. For example, in the big textile industry of Retsinas, Alexandros Retsinas became the chairman of the company’s board as he succeeded his elder brother—Theodoros—in 1887. Another similar example constituted the case of Oikonomides enterprise, a company that manufactured paints.20 In case when a firm faced debts and the son, or the sons of the family, was underage, the father appointed executors of his will who were called to settle the pending financial obligations of the firm and to pay off the company’s debts to third parties, being also in charge of providing for the weak family members, namely the wife and daughters.21 The same people were often appointed as agreed guardians for the children. Greek women’s participation in business networks as heiresses of family enterprises is framed in a vague image because of regional, contextual, as well as time variants. Despite these differences, the sanctity of blood ties made the bond trust very strong in business networks where the interests of the kinship were inseparable and intertwined. In the firm belief for keeping family enterprises untouched, the desire of the testator of a will to nominate and appoint a female member of his family circle as executor of his will and as a legitimate person for assuming the full control and management of the firm, was not rare. For instance, Konstantinos Panagiotopoulos, owner of a steam-operated flour mill based in Piraeus, nominated as successor of his enterprise his adult daughter, Aggeliki, with

the explicit command that nobody else but her would assume full responsibility. Additionally, the rest of his children were assigned the roles of shareholders and participants in the management of the company when they would come of age.22 Aggeliki had acquired the know-how of the running of the family business and was experienced. Her father’s mill was one of the biggest enterprises in the field of flour industry since 1875. It employed about 182 workers.23 In this company there were no guardians or consultants appointed24 because Aggeliki was well experienced as she was involved in business being the elder daughter of Panagiotopoulos family. So, seniority was significant as it often entailed direct engagement in family business affairs in the absence of an adult male member. This also answers the question why Aggeliki seemed to have gained managerial skills and was thought of being a successful business woman. In this case gender discrimination is not visible because what businesspeople counted more as their first priority was the prosperity and solidarity of their family enterprises. When Aggeliki got married she transferred the full control of her company to her husband, Demos Vourvoulis,25 who was owner of another flour mill.26 Another case study of a big company was the firm of Metaxas. The brandy distillery company of Metaxas,27 also based in Piraeus, was founded by Spyridon Metaxas who died in 1909. Spyridon cooperated with two of his brothers: Elias and Alexandros. Later, the younger brother, Georgios, joined the company. Georgios was an educated man with an excellent

He helped his compatriots who originated from Mani by offering them a placement in his mill. Vourvoulis was also an elected member of the municipal council of Piraeus.

knowledge in business management and a very good command of foreign languages. His contribution to the company was crucial as he helped the firm that faced economic problems survive with capitals supplied by rich relatives of his wife.28 After Spyridon’s death, Elias Metaxas continued the operation of the distillery along with Spyridon’s widow named Despoina Metaxa, who became a limited partner holding part of the industry’s shares until her death in 1920. When Alexandros died, his wife Aggeliki Metaxa took over part of the company. We do not know much about Aggeliki’s life. As for Despoina Metaxa—née Monarchidou—it is known that she originated from the island of Psarra, where she was born in 1892.29 After her death, part of the couple’s money was donated for the purpose of building a hospital in Piraeus for treating patients suffering from cancer. The hospital operates even today under the name ‘Metaxa Cancer Hospital of Piraeus’.30 Despoina’s two daughters, Thiresia and Aggeliki, were also engaged in the industry’s commercial activities.31 Eleni Kakavouli-Nafpliotou constitutes another case study. Since 1873, her family factory in Piraeus operated with engines of seventeen horsepower (hp) that processed iron, steel, brass, and lead. The factory also produced scales and safes that were either sold in domestic trade or exported to other countries such as Turkey, Egypt, Serbia, Romania, and Albania.32 The enterprise was located at 3 Hephaestus St.33 Its capital cycle came up to forty million drachmas.34 Eleni’s father—K.

bequeathed her the factory that at first produced scales according to a newspaper advertisement in 1881.35 Konstantinos Kakavoulis was a small artisan who worked first as an iron monger. Because he wanted to escape waged employment he set up a small workshop.36 The trademark of Eleni’s Kakavouli firm was a cross. Her firm prospered. During the first decades of the twentieth century her company manufactured highly sophisticated products such as the unburned type of safes based on the English patent of ‘Milners’. Her safes were also pieces of art because they were decorated with nice and solid metal letters.37 An invoice of 1938 bears the name of the firm, ‘Eleni Kakavouli: Factory of Scales and Safes’ and as a subtitle, ‘Successor: Emmanuel G. Pagkalos, Piraeus’.38 E. Pagkalos is recorded as the owner of a workshop for making scales, while Eleni Kakavouli had a factory of safes, independently of her relative K. Kakavoulis, who also managed a firm of manufacturing safes in the beginning of the twentieth century.39 Women are reported in modern Greece to also be involved in many other types of business, mainly as heiresses of their husbands’ or fathers’ companies. For example, Maria G. Agathokli was widow of the businessman Georgios P. Agathoklis who had a joint company along with his brother—Konstantinos—including a number of enterprises. The ‘Agathoklis Brothers’ firm based in the Greek town Stylis, was a multi-purpose plant that comprised a spinner’s enterprise, a flour mill factory, and a pasta workshop.40 ‘The Agathoklis Brothers’ firm also kept business transactions with Piraeus, it being the family’s birth place.41 According to recorded material, in 1892, the ‘K. P. Agathoklis’ firm set up a number of water-powered mills in Lamia. In 1896, the firm also organized a branch of the company in the same town in order to sell products of the

Stylis-based plant. In 1897, the factory of the same region used big ovens for baking bread in order to supply the Greek army.42 Konstantinos was the soul of all enterprises.43 He was not married. In 1908, he secretly named his brother, Georgios, as the sole beneficiary in his will.44 After Georgios’ death (1921), all mobile assets that the family possessed, as well as the big landed estate of 8400 acres located in the area named ‘Pazaraki’ in Trikala, passed on to his wife, Maria,45 along with a water-powered mill for grinding grains in the same town.46 During the years 1923–1924, Maria’s son—M. Agathoklis—undertook the operation of the mill changing the firm’s name to ‘M.G. Agathoklis and Co’.47 Maria seemed to be directly involved in her husband’s business for two years in their Trikalabased mill until her son came of age and took over the family’s business that he later sold. The town of Trikala seemed to be their residence and the center of their business ventures as Maria’s husband was an elected member of the Hellenic Parliament of Trikala constituency in 1905.48 In Kalamata—another Greek town—Kleio M. Callicouni was an active and experienced female industrialist as her family factory produced liquor and spirits products such as the Greek ‘masticha’, ‘raki’, and brandy as well as various kinds of other sweet liquors. The firm was awarded with many prizes abroad, the most honorable of which was the prize of the ‘Societé Philomathique’ of Bordeaux in France. The company received orders not only from Greece but also from Europe and the USA.49 It also had a branch in the center of Athens.50 In 1919, when the man in charge of the distillery (N. Callicounis) died, the business passed onto the hands of his wife, Kleio, as well as to his three sisters. The four women managed successfully the distillery that prospered despite the big economic crash of the

period 1919–1936 and the Asia Minor catastrophe. Later, the four women bequeathed the business to the family’s heir named N. Callicounis who had pursued studies in the Athens University and was mature to take over the factory.51 Here, it is also noted women’s involvement in managing family business as widows, or heiresses of deceased husbands, fathers, or brothers. Similar to Agathoklis’ case, the female members of Callicounis company successfully handled the economic transactions of the family firm albeit temporarily and for a transitional period until the male heirs were ready and mature to take over the business. In Athens, Pavlidis chocolate factory constitutes another case study of industrial activity.52 In 1841, it is noted his first pastry shop in the center of Athens that made sweets in syrup such as ‘baclava’. From 1842 until 1852, Spyridon Pavlidis, an active and energetic man who did not want to remain stagnant in his business ventures, traveled to Italy, where he gained better knowledge in chocolate-making. During the period 1852–1863, the first chocolate was served in his Athenian ‘Glykismatopoieion’ (pastry shop), first as a hot drink. In 1861, Spyridon Pavlidis imported from Paris the first manually operated machine for making chocolate bars.53 Newspapers wrote that the Athens elite lined up outside his pastry shop in order to buy his famous chocolate. The firm was awarded with twenty gold and silver awards.54 In 1878, his son Dimitrios Pavlidis succeeded the founder of the enterprise. In 1895, Alexandros Pavlidis took over the business. During the first decades of the twentieth century the chocolate factory prospered and more precisely during the years 1920–1924. However, the early death of Alexandros who passed away at the age of fifty-four, was a big loss for the chocolate factory but not for long, as his widow—Elenibecame in charge of the enterprise in 1924.55 The business owed much of

its future growth and innovative steps to Eleni’s contribution.56 One such step of improvement in the flavor of the chocolate was taken by her as she added whole almonds that made it even more tasty. Eleni’s economic contribution to the family firm further illustrates the cases of business women that took over family companies and continued their operation successfully, often adding their own touch of taste along with novel ideas. In Piraeus, more cases of female presence in the industrial sector are recorded in the first decades of the twentieth century. In 1910, Eirini Finopoulou57 took over her husband’s management—Efstathios Finopoulos.58 It was a big enterprise that was engaged in the spirits and liquor trade and was named ‘IVI-Finopoulos’. It traded large-scale products and was the supplier of the Royal Court. The industry was founded in 1860.59 In 1913 another woman named M. Alexandropoulou held a managerial position in the family firm that manufactured needles and nails. The company’s owner was her male relative Evaggelos Alexandropoulos. In 1915, Eleni Konstantopoulou took over the family-owned flour industry of Vasileios Konstantopoulos.60 Vasileios died in 1907, and according to his obituary published in the newspaper Empros, Eleni was his wife.61 During the first decades of the twentieth century, wives’ roles of holding managerial posts in their husbands’ firms were not a rare phenomenon as we saw in the lines above. They often received assistance from a male member of their family and they were experienced in the management of a company through their direct or indirect engagement in its operation. At the dawn of the twentieth century, Piraeus played the most significant role in the country’s industrial growth. During the period 1860–1900, it was transformed into a big industrial city being also Greece’s biggest port. The seventy-six steam-operated workshops and factories along with the workforce of 7500 workers formed the backbone of national

production. Moreover, the rapid increase in population62 and the use of cheap raw materials and fuel that facilitated the transportation of the industrial products to the rest of the country and abroad, constituted the main factors which contributed to the modernization of the factories along with the use of steam engines.63 During the years 1870–1922, it was not only Piraeus but also the whole country that doubled the number of its citizens as well as its land. As a consequence, urban population increased by 27% in 1920 which contrasted to that of the year 1879 when the rise stood at only 14%. Urbanization was also the reason for the rise of female employment in the service sector. However, the census did not appear to be complete as a quite large number of female waged workers were not recorded because they worked from home. So, their payment was undeclared as they were not included in the company’s payroll. Most of them earned piecework wages, being not fully employed. This case also applied to employers’ spouses, widows, and daughters, who were also invisible in the payment records and account books.64 This element leads to the assumption that though economic elite ladies managed their family’s business by taking on the position of the strategic decision-makers, or by chairing the company’s board—as seen above—they served the post unselfishly, viewing these responsibilities as an extension of their duties as heiresses of wealthy fathers and husbands. It seemed that they did not work out of mere ambition in order to build up a career. They simply followed the social norm. Under this contextual framework, social norms along with the rapid pace of urbanization and the growth of industrialization in Greece prompted female members of the merchant elite to take action in various other activities, as well. One of them was philanthropy because the upper-middle-class elite women decided to organize and sponsor charity institutions, orphanages, and schools for the poor and destitute. By patronizing charity organizations, they attempted to solve social problems by approaching them as an extension of motherhood and of the civilizing role that

women had to play. However, one can also see these benevolent initiatives of the bourgeois ladies as a field for exercising social control65 because their actions often aimed at assisting their husbands in their professional and business careers especially when they ran as candidates in order to be elected members of the Hellenic Parliament, or they aimed at running for a post in the municipal elections in order to become mayors. Moreover, the husbands of wealthy business elites often had plans for being elected members of the cabinet of the Greek government. Therefore, spouses collected votes for them. One method was offering help to the poor and needy people.66 The Greek women’s newspaper Ephemeris ton Kyrion [Ladies’ Journal], which was managed and edited by the active feminist journalist Kallirrohe Parren, gives a comprehensive picture of the social life and charity that the elite ladies in Piraeus led and exercised in the early twentieth century.67 In one of her articles entitled ‘He Hellinides eis ta Nosokomeia’ [The Greek Ladies taking action in Hospitals], Parren wrote that though the city of Piraeus was situated very close to Athens, it was viewed as a provincial town not much preferred for residence by the elite of Piraeus as a number of them resided in Athens. Therefore, Piraeus was the home of small artisans, only. One reason was based on the fact that it lacked in culture, and the bourgeois people had to attend the cultural events taking place in the Greek capital. In Athens, the wives of the industrialists of Piraeus did not only get busy with shopping, visiting tailors, and attending social happenings but they also followed the charity model of the Athenian ladies and the way they organized their philanthropic work.68 Later, the wealthy women of Piraeus established their own society for destitute women of the big port, the goal of which was to supply those in need with daily meals. Additionally, they set up a special department in the hospital for the

nursing practice. Another worth-mentioning charity society was the Syndesmos Kyrion pros Prostasian tis Ergatidos [Women’s Association for the Protection of the Female Worker] that was set up in Piraeus in 1904. According to its charter, the goal of the association was ‘the ethical and the material protection’ of the class of female workers of Piraeus as well as their basic literacy. The association comprised three different departments: one was that of the Sunday schools, the other was in charge of social care, and the third aimed at providing the poor with daily meals. A woman named A.P. Xanthaki chaired the board. The post of the vice president was held by Eliza Damala. Its secretary was Amalia Perraki, while the position of the association’s bursar was held by Argyro Feraldi.69 In the Syndesmos, the female workers not only received the basics in learning and were supplied with warm daily meals but also received personal care.70 The Sunday school in Piraeus also aimed at shaping female workers’ character akin to the bourgeois model by instructing them on acceptable standards of behavior. The above ladies of charity schools and philanthropic institutions were spouses or daughters of the business elite people who belonged to the merchant-embedded clan. Hence, the employers also stood great chances in securing for themselves a disciplined working staff for their factories. Moreover, as analyzed in the previous lines, the ladies also cared for their husbands’ political careers and philanthropy adding to the success of their campaigns as the needy people felt grateful—hence—they willingly voted for them. Therefore, the system was based on a clientele-oriented mechanism, in many cases.71 Argyro Feraldi was daughter of the active mayor of Piraeus—Loukas Rallis—who was an industrialist. Rallis was a member of the board of Eleimon Hetaireia [Charity Association], while his office as the head of the municipality of Piraeus lasted from 1855 until 1866.72 Argyro’s husband—F. Feraldis—was also an industrialist who owned a gas factory in Athens that he had set up in 1857.73 Argyro was engaged in benevolent activities in many ways. For example, she was reported to collect clothing for destitute girls along with another elite lady named Rallou Vlagali. Rallou was an upper-middle-class woman, wife of Alexandros Vlagalis,

who was the manager of the Athens-Piraeus Railway Company. The couple lived in a mansion in the seaside suburb of Neo Faliro near Piraeus. Rallou seemed to be also an active participant in the public sphere by taking care not only of the poor and destitute women,74 but by also assisting her husband in his office. For example, she assisted him in his effort to persuade passengers to use the new electric train that started its operation at the beginning of the twentieth century. According to her account of facts and due to the fact that people were prejudiced against using electric trains for the fear lest they would be burnt by high voltage, her husband used to take her every day to the train and to commute together from Piraeus to Athens on a round trip. This was her attempt to prove that she was a fearless living example of a train commuter.75 A.P. Xanthaki was another bourgeois lady who was engaged in the above-mentioned association. She was related to Paul Xanthakis76 who had been elected as a senior member of Piraeus municipality because he had gained the highest number of votes. During Greece’s difficult period of the ‘National Schism’77 from November 1916 until January 1917, he served as the acting mayor of Piraeus in place of A. Panagiotopoulos (1860–1939).78 The other

Greece’s tearing apart by the ‘National Schism’ had its roots in the clash between the Greek Prime Minister E. Venizelos and King Constantine over the country’s foreign policy and diplomacy during the First World War. Venizelos proposed a plan that was based on an alliance between the Greek country and the Triple Entente. To the contrary, the King opted for a neutral position. Venizelos was forced to resign twice while Greece was divided between north and south. In the north, the revolutionary government under Venizelos, along with General Danglis and Admiral Kountouriotis, had its headquarters in Thessaloniki, while in Athens it was stationed at the official government that had been appointed by Royal Decree.

Panagiotopoulos—a Venizelos’ supporter, drove his car around the city during the night in an effort to calm down the worried citizens.

charity lady, Eliza Damala, was the vice president in the association’s board. She was related to Pavlos Damalas who was a doctor and also mayor of Piraeus for the period 1903–1907.79 As mentioned above, the Syndesmos Kyrion pros Prostasian tis Ergatidos was established in 1904, a year that coincided with her husband’s office.80 Eliza was also a relative of the influential family of Loukas Rallis through Pavlos Damalas.81 Amalia Perraki was the secretary of the association. Her family owned an iron factory.82 In 1916, her family also managed a tanneries factory in the Greek port.83 Stylianos Perrakis, of the same family, owned a shipyard.84 Regarding the lady that was referred in the Ephemeris ton Kyrion as member of the Syndesmos under her last name only, (‘Spiliotopoulou’), there is no more information provided. Probably she was also born into a wealthy family as her associates.85 Athina Dilaveri constituted another business elite woman of Piraeus who was engaged in broad-scale charity work. She was daughter of the flour industrialist, Vasileios Konstantopoulos.86 Her husband, Kriton Dilaveris, took over the tiles company that he inherited through his father. The flourishing tile firm was set up in 1888. Kriton was also elected as a member of the Hellenic Parliament for the constituency of Piraeus for the term 1946–1950. He died in 1972.87 Athina set up the Omilos Kyrion-filon tis Astynomias Peiraios (Ladies’ Society-Friends of Piraeus Police).

She created a sick bay of twenty-five beds for the Piraeus policemen. The society also supplied them with medicine, clothing, and schoolbooks for their children. Additionally, she organized a kids’ summer camp in her husband’s big, leafy, landed estate on the island of Aegina. She died in 1970 having bequeathed considerable assets and relief to the poor and destitute.88 Apart from blood ties there were other types of institutionalized principles that boosted capitalist families’ interests, profits, and relations in their milieu, based on the following main shared values: intermarriage (endogamy), adoption (the practice of being the best man in a marriage, or the godfather in the christening of children, called Koumbaria), and fraternization.89 Endogamy was the key to success in business ventures during the nineteenth century. In the ‘hearths’ (tzakia) of merchants, intermarriage was part of a strategic plan. By having their sons or daughters marry somebody from another powerful merchant house of their clan, it helped the expansion of their business networks.90 This was the recipe for commercial growth. Moreover, intermarriage between Greek Orthodox influential business people secured the building up of steady foundations for a new household as the couple shared common religious affinity, culture, and tradition. An example constitutes the case of the will of a merchant named Stergios Nikolides-Pindo, in 1843 where the testator, a wealthy businessman of Vienna91 and also a highly respected man, strongly advised his son to get married to a Greek-Orthodox woman by explicitly explaining why this practice was the right decision. He based his argument on the premise that experience gained from life, shows that the couple’s life who shared different religious beliefs did not lead to happy conjugal and parental relations. Although intermarriage showed irregularity depending on different time periods, it was a firm belief embedded in the merchant clan that marrying somebody of the same home place held better prospects for a successful marriage. This was Pindo’s belief as this

notion manifested the Greek-Orthodox families’ refusal to marrying people from a different cultural background for the same reasons as those mentioned above.92 Overall, it expressed resistance to assimilation. But in the course of time, this practice seemed to be given up in many regions. In Vienna—for instance—there was an increasing number of registered marriages between people of different Christian dogmas or religion in the second half of the eighteenth century.93 To the contrary, religious affinity played an important role in Odessa because there were no religious barriers in the indigenous people because Greeks and Russians were both Christian Orthodox. Therefore, nurturing marriage alliances was quite frequent from the late nineteenth century in the areas where there was homogeneity in religion.94 However, in the warm recollection of the ideals and cultural achievements of fatherland, the Greek culture was always present in the arguments put forward by the heads of the Greek communities who were in charge of educational institutions, also serving as centers for preserving the ancient Greek language and civilization.95 Moreover, endogamy was the stepping-stone of the male members of the market-embedded cliques and business circles in order to climb up high echelons.96 More particularly, large-lineage intermarriage was largely much preferred. This was common practice especially in the Chiot trading clan. It was also widely practiced by the Greek businessmen who owned firms in England and had accumulated wealth as their companies traded commodities with the Orient and with the Black Sea. Following this pattern, Emmanuel Frangiadis, a Chiot businessman, aged twenty in 1833, got married to Marigo Rodokanachi, sister of his business partner Ioannis Rodokanachis. Following this practice he boosted his economic and social profile.97 Another case was that of Stefanos Frangiadis—the fourth son of Emmanuel G. Frangiadis—who, at the age of thirty, got married to the

twenty-nine-year-old Despoina, daughter of the wealthy tradesman Ioannis Skaramangas from Rostov of South Russia, in 1875. Skaramangas was a close business partner of Stefanos’ father. Moreover, Stefanos’ sister—Elisabeth Frangiadis—got married to Ioannis who was George Skaramangas’ senior brother. Stefanos’ marriage to Despoina had been arranged by their parents who had them betrothed at a very young age.98 Female role was passive in these premarital agreements, and women acted like pawns with some exceptions. They were married at the very early age of fourteen or fifteen in order to give birth to many children. Intermarriage was a social practice followed by Greek Orthodox business networks despite the fact that the young sons and daughters of the elites were grown up in an international surrounding, had fostered Western ideas, and led a cosmopolitan life. In line with the customary law of the Chiot business circles, endogamy was a social practice that was never to be given up because it was believed that the consequences would be serious on the grounds that marrying a member from their own milieu would secure better trading prospects in favor of their firms’ expansion and prosperity.99 Therefore, the long child betrothal was a personal vow, a commitment in effect while there was no thought of failing it. The marriage between Stefanos and Despoina took place in Russia, the bride’s birthplace.100 The reason why the couple chose Russia was based on Frangiadis’ project according to which he thought expedient to examine on site the local conditions in trade and see for himself if he could broaden his scale of enterprises with his in-laws.101 Assuming from the methods followed, there was not only women’s passive role in the intermarriage process but also men’s blind obedience to their parents’ plans as the main aim was the expansion and prosperity of their business ventures. Researchers assume that the full control of an enterprise, along with the commercial branches that had to be well-represented abroad, was the goal which was sought for by merchants, and intermarriage served the purpose perfectly. Additionally, because there were no other means of exchanging information apart from postal mail, the practice of having blood relatives, or compatriots to represent their firms abroad, secured trustworthiness.

Moreover, it facilitated the exchange of reliable information on the operation of the business and on the prospects of commercial expansion. Hence, these family-based international trading networks functioned as closed clubs where outsiders were denied access.102 The Chiots owed their power and influence to a high degree to their discipline as determined by the hierarchy and coherence of the families.103 Behind the marital or premarital contracts and engagements, there was a full-scale strategic plan that comprised two parts: one was related to the way of how companies were organized, and the other was associated with the method of trading. Collectiveness was the usual legal frame in the Chiot business ventures. Moreover, the main plan of the firms’ strategy was laid in the headquarters, while the rest of the branches of the network followed the policy of the nerve center. The business partners held managerial positions. The most competent member of the board assumed responsibilities in the management of the head offices as the headquarters were attested with the nationality label of the company. Another organizational scheme was the legal autonomy that the branches enjoyed while—at the same time—they equally shared the profits.104 Under this frame of operation, endogamy fit better as social practice. Anna Mandylara poses the question whether the arranged intermarriage among the Chiot families in the French port city of Marseille rested on the couple’s common place of origin, or it happened so because they belonged to the same social class.105 It is true that endogamy went through different stages with spatial and temporal variants and implications. During the eighteenth to nineteenth centuries, intermarriage had regional characteristics defined by blood, or marriage relations. Blood ties were attached with more significance. However, in the mid-nineteenth century endogamy had been attested with different criteria in the well-presented Greek community of Marseille for instance, where the groom’s high level of education was much appreciated. If he had pursued higher studies, he was considered as an open-minded man with cultivated personality and fine manners.

possession as well as a good level of education more than the common place of origin, though the latter was much preferred. In the early twentieth century, it is evident that within this new context in social status, there was a convergence of practices in the projects’ planning, according to which superiority in the level of intellectuality was highly rated.106 In the autobiographical novel Loukis Laras (1879) written by Demetrios Vikelas—son of an influential Greek Chiot capitalist family—there are explicitly referred reasons for intermarriage in the Chiot clan. Vikelas wrote that each business elite family planned to marry their sons and daughters with members of their own social business circles because the number of those who were born into wealthy families was limited. Due to this fact, the efforts of the elite for procuring good marriages for their off springs started early. The narrow Chiot circle and the restricted number of wealthy families necessitated marriages between close relatives in many cases. Their argument was based on the proven success of this practice. Since early childhood and in line with this social norm, future young couples were nurtured with the idea of getting married to each other. Vikelas also added that there was a long period of social contacts that came after the betrothal period. Though the young couple did not have the heart’s ‘stirrings’, as it happened when somebody was married for love, it secured them a quiet life without ‘violent’ turbulences. This tradition was maintained for the sake of ‘material interests and calculations’ and for the benefit of receiving a good amount of cash for dowry that was granted to the young woman by her parents.107 Following this practice, they built the steady foundations that secured their marriage with harmony and unity, these also being the assets with which the family became powerful. Consequently, intermarriage was an effective means through which the Chiots based their prosperity because in their social circle—as it was written in the previous pages—marriage was used as a tool for increasing business profits, for boosting their commercial profile, and for setting up fresh projects for their new enterprises. The following example drawn from Loukis Laras further illustrates this case. In the book, the hero’s two sisters had been married to two of the author’s friends who the family had agreed
106 In line with these new social perceptions and broad-scale practices, the marriage between the Greek affluent manufacturer by the last name ‘Zarifis’ and the daughter of a French manufacturer, named ‘Terrin’, was not a breaking up of the social norm.

on setting up business relations with.108 Very often, striking a bargain over the size of the dowry before fixing the marriage was common practice. The groom weighted with precision the premarital donation that he was going to receive. However, Penelope Delta—a well-known author of children’s books and daughter of a rich cotton merchant of Alexandria, Egypt—wrote that she started protesting with indignation on this bargaining of women’s dowry. Nevertheless, this was a usual method for procuring a good match. Delta expressed herself openly and against the type of a man who weighted the cash of dowry in order to decide which girl constituted the most gainful marriage case for him. In Delta’s social circle, money was highly esteemed while people’s social recognition and respect were based on how much wealth they had accumulated. In line with this social rule, the writer’s mother used to tell her daughters that dignity counted a lot, but a young woman had to possess a good share of income in order to marry somebody she wanted.109 She also added that what was valued more in their social circle was the amount of cash that girls received by their parents upon marriage. Otherwise, brides had to make compromises and not to expect much. In most cases, the biggest sum of the initial capital that merchants used for their trading activities, was drawn from their spouses’ dowry.110 In this context, the possession of dowry was a big asset in women’s hands as it granted them with the power to influence their husbands’ decision-making policy on financial affairs. Moreover, the higher the amount of cash dowry they received, the more chances it stood for wealthy young brides to have their own final say in the match that their parents arranged for them. For example, in Kastoria111 the customary law dictated that the brides, daughters of wealthy merchants, decided themselves about their future husbands by expressing their own opinion about the man that

This was due to the fact that its inhabitants were mainly engaged in the small-scale industry of fur processing.

their parents had proposed them to marry. For this reason the groom—to be—visited the mansion house112 of his future wife along with his relatives. The room where they sat in order to strike the deal and to fix the amount of cash for dowry, was located in the ladies’ quarters.113 At the mezzanine floor of the mansion where one could find the family’s bedrooms, there was a small opening kind of window—to the young woman’s bedroom. From this small opening, the bride-to-be took a secret look at her future husband and decided whether she liked him or not.114 On this mezzanine floor, there was also a small entrance door through which the mother entered in her daughter’s bedroom in order to hear about her decision.115 If the young woman liked the man, then her mother made sweet coffee to treat her guests but if the bride-to-be disapproved of the groom, then the served coffee was bitter. As a general rule, because marriages between sons and daughters of wealthy families were a product of good trading bargains, and social bonds facilitated commercial plans and trading projects, the final deal was usually struck at the main reception room of the mansion. In this room there were also given big receptions for feast days, engagements, or marriages.116 In Kastoria, the above social tenet according to which young wealthy women freely expressed their preference or, disapproval of, their future husbands, indicates that female members in the above rich families did not hold an inferior position since they had their own say and decided about their future themselves.117 As mentioned above, blood-relation practices and endogamy strategies were the main broadly used instruments for procuring successful marriage alliances and for planning good business projects in capitalist families while women’s contribution to this practice was sound in a number of cases. The following example further illustrates these methods. The businessmanAlexandros Mavros—had a large-scale lineage who worked for his

For example, according to number 2754 ecclesiastical codex of the Archbishop of Kastoria, lady Elaia—spouse of Chrysos Betlis—and also lady Kseno—wife of Georgios Betlis—as well as the lord K. Betlis, had been donors to the above church. See more in: Theocharidou, K., ibid., p. 324, footnote 1.

company. In this particular firm, Efrosyni—the wife of the founder of Mavros’ trading firm—exerted pressure on her husband in favor of her own relatives and she succeeded in carrying out her plan.118 It goes without saying that by taking advantage of her husband’s powerful position in the company, Efrosyni appointed her two brothers and her two brothers-in-law as representatives of the branches of Mavros’ business networks in Marseille, Livorno, and Taganrog.119 London constitutes another example where the system of mutual kinship120 played its significant role, too.121 When the spouses of the Greek Orthodox merchants secured their position in family lineage and became more mature with age, they also exerted pressure on their husbands in favor of their own relatives for the purpose of finding them a placement in the family companies especially if their relatives were economically weak. More particularly, kinship networks worked in the best of the way in the cases of Rallis Brothers and Rodokanachis family firms as they were pioneers in establishing enterprises that were organized on a multinational level by cooperating with their relatives and compatriots who represented them abroad.122 Another example illustrates the case of Melas family, ancestors of D. Vikelas. Georgios Melas was married to Eleni—daughter of Mihail Vassiliou—in Constantinople. The marriage connected him closely with the influential Constantinople-based family of Sevastopoulos, parental home of Mihail Vassiliou’s wife.123 Lending money to relatives, or offering financial assistance to their compatriots, was another side of practice followed by the Greek native and diaspora business networks. In Odessa124—for instance—in 1789, when

the port had not reached the peak of its commercial growth yet, the Greek tradesmen borrowed money from their family members or compatriots, at a very high interest rate.125 The example of the firm of ‘A. Avgerinos and Son’ further clarifies it. In 1803, A. Avgerinos and his son had set up a company in Odessa, with capital that their uncle had lent them.126 From the above cases it is deduced that the systems of mutual kinship, of familial cooperation, and of the relations of the trade-embedded clan, worked successfully in the capitalist families and also in the Chiot families, in many ways.127 The same practice also applied to the commercial firms based in Taganrog which were engaged in diverse business activities and not only in trading grain. In fact, the first merchants who settled in Azov, traded commodities much consumed in Russia such as alcoholic beverages which ‘Vernardakis House’ dealt with, or fish products that the same company also did business with.128 Another key element that helps us explore better how interfamilial relations of the economic elite contributed to the augmentation of the Greek business networks was children’s christening, or being the best men in the wedding ceremonies of their own milieu. Penelope Delta—for instancewas the godmother of her nephew, son of her sister Alexandra and wife of an Englishman named Tom Davies. This was common practice in the closely knit community of the Vlachs in Vienna, too. The Vlachs were a tightly interrelated ethnic group with various customs and traditions that defined the Vlach cultural background. The Vlachs were also reproduced through endogamy and they exerted their influence by means of god parenthood (koumbaria) that entailed the christening of children of their community, or being the best men in wedding ceremonies. One such example constitutes the case of a merchant named Konstantinos Moschas who had baptized fifteen children of the Vlach commercial-embedded clan in Vienna. In this christening practice, women held their own share. For instance, Aikaterini Tzetiri, along with her husband and other family
or noninclusion in the labor market depended on the finances of their family and more especially on the ability of male breadwinners to financially support them, or not. See more in: Sifneos, E., (2010), ‘Rentiers, teachers and workers: Greek women in late nineteenth-century Odessa’, Byzantine and Modern Greek Studies 34:2 (182–200), (published online: July 18th, 2013). 125 The interest rate reached at 30–35 percent. See: Kardases, V., ibid., p. 93. 126 Their uncle, Theodoros Avgerinos, had been appointed as the Russian consul in Smyrna.

members was the godmother of twenty-two children. Additionally, Konstantinos Moschas had been the best man in the wedding ceremony of Konstantinos Tzetiris129 and Eleftheria Adami.130 In a nutshell, the christening of children, or being the best man in wedding ceremonies, were two sides of social practices that cemented the foundations of business networks. The above social norms and cultural traits also added to the extension of land business ventures of the Vlachs who were mainly engaged in the trading of agricultural products that they imported in Budapest and Vienna from the Balkans mainland. Adoption was another social tenet and cultural characteristic traced everywhere in both prerevolutionary and postrevolutionary Greece as well as in the dispersed Greek communities outside the Greek borders. In line with this practice, orphan children, or kids whose parents suffered from extreme poverty, were adopted by childless couples. The act of adoption was secured by written documents signed by both parties—the biological couple and the foster parents—in the presence of witnesses and with the Church’s blessings.131 According to John A. Petropoulos, extreme poverty was a factor that facilitated the building up of these clientele-based relations between foster parents and biological mothers and fathers, or between the kinship of the adopted child. Adoption also served as an official mechanism with which the chieftains exerted influence and bound their chief and brave soldiers (pallhikaria) so as to remain fully dependent on them.132 Adoption also constituted a shared value for Greek diaspora merchants. In this context, it was not used in its strict meaning only, but in the broad context of protecting their employees as if they were members of their own family. Indicative case was that of Rallis’ business firms the clerks of which worked with loyalty while later the chance was given to a number of them who were highly motivated to set up their own business companies. According to Stephanos Rallis, his employees were diligent and hardworking. Moreover, as a rule, he always employed Greeks, judging not ‘out of mere patriotism’, only, but because of the fact that the Greeks were ‘competent and loyal’.133
129 The names ‘Tzetiris’ and ‘Tzetiri’ refer to the same family and to the same name. The first has got the masculine ending ‘s’, while the second has the feminine ending that takes no ‘s’, according to the Greek grammar. 130 Chatziioannou, M.,-Ch., Nees prosegiseis... ibid., p. 153.

Blood brotherhood (adelfopoiisi) was another type of social practice that asserted its long presence in the Balkans which the Greek Orthodox Church blessed. Its main purpose was to assist the male members of the cast. The Albanian-speaking population of the Greek communities called the members of the blood brotherhood ‘vlamides’. The Greek historic society named ‘Society of Friends’ (Philiki Etaireia) used the term ‘vlamides’ or ‘adelfopoiitoi’ that was the first of the seven degrees of initiation.134 Fraternizing was common practice between Christians and Muslims, too.135 Over the centuries, the Greek communities that were dispersed in the diverse European regions used this form of fraternity. It functioned in line with their social rules and local conditions. In Transylvania, brotherhood had been observed since the seventeenth century where the merchants were organized in guilds, the core of which was the common Ottoman citizenship. Another characteristic was the trading of Ottoman commodities that made Christian merchants valuable to the economy of their area. As a reward, these traders enjoyed safety and protection granted to them by the Ottoman local authorities.136 In the class of merchants, fraternities included different types of cliques that put together their agencies in order to gain more profits. Moreover, it served commercial profit, mercantile privileges, or the maintaining of religious and national identity. Unlike the general rule of fraternizing, in the nineteenth-century Greek community of London, fraternity constituted a different case as it served as an urban agglomeration with the building of a Greek Orthodox parish that catered for the needs of the community’s religious practices. The fraternity in London built a Greek Orthodox cemetery for the same purpose, and it also set up a school named the ‘Greek College’, where young generations were taught the principles of Greek education.137

The shared cultural trait of speaking the same language was another type of cohesive bond amid the dispersed Greek merchants. The Greek language was commonly spoken in the Greek communities of the Black Sea where spouses, mothers, or grandmothers of the mercantile diaspora clan played the role of the guardian of Greek civilization, in an attempt to maintain Greek tradition and customs. In the case of Odessa’s organized community, they sponsored educational institutions including a high school for girls, and another one for boys. Theodora Rodokanachi funded a girls’ school named after her because she was its benefactor. In the same area, the female members were highly respected because they were considered to be the vehicles for promulgating the Greek language and culture to the next generations since they were assigned with the task of rearing their children and of managing their households.138 In the early diaspora generations, the Greek language was used in their conversations along with the French language as second language. The Russian language was spoken as a third option. Because of the frequent marriages between Russians and Greeks the Greek language lost its preponderance, in the course of time, another reason was the lack of Greek-speaking nurses, governesses, or servants. Because of these factors, the descendants did not retain ‘the full panoply of linguistic equipment’. In case when there was a Greek-Russian marriage, grandmothers were in charge of maintaining Greek customs. For example, one of their duties was to take their grandchildren to the Greek cathedral on Sundays and on various festive occasions.139 Furthermore, the Greek-speaking domestic staff of the opulent diaspora households also served as the guardians of traditions of motherland and as those who cared for the family’s welfare and safety. In the book Loukis Laras, Andrianna—the loyal chief servant of the family—cared for the family’s true welfare serving them selflessly. She unselfishly offered her services to the mother and children taking personal care of everything and always finding time to perform all of her duties.140 By contrast, in other Greek communities, the Greek cultural traits were not maintained. In Alexandria, for instance, in the late nineteenth century, the upper bourgeoisie favored foreign private schooling or tutoring for children because parents wished to provide them with a high level of education, and the Greek schools of the community were not considered

efficient because they functioned in line with the Greek state mechanism with teachers appointed by the Greek state. Consequently, the wealthy merchants preferred their daughters and sons to attend foreign schools. In this context, homeschooling and tutoring were used as alternative ways of providing them with education.141 As a rule, women had the upper hand in children’s raising and education being those who decided on what school their offsprings should be sent. Another example is that of the Greek community in London. The families of the Greek merchants who resided in the English capital, did not rear their kids according to Greek culture. Having experienced the calamity of their fatherland because of the Greek people’s slaughtering by the Turks in the 1821 Revolution for Independence, the early generations who settled in Great Britain sought a shelter in London where they planned to start a new life. The English aristocracy with its refined manners impressed them. They soon realized that it was very difficult for them to be admitted to the upper English trading class. The English brokers, or employees who worked for the Greek business firms, were viewed as the representatives of this culture and the traders desired to instill the English values in the future Greek generations. For this purpose, they hired English nannies to raise their children. The young people used to spend the whole day with their governesses and to have English conversation with them in order to practice the language in the native speakers’ English accent. The reason was based on the fact that the Greek parents—and especially mothers—were afraid lest they sound rude in their foreign accent with no ‘refined English manners’, and this would count as negative in the eyes of their domestic staff. This practice was applied in almost all households of London Greeks.142 However, not all of business elite women were so lucky as to receive proper schooling. Very often family firms faced bankruptcy and—as a result—education was set as a second priority. D. Vikelas writes about his mother’s love for learning in hard financial times. He often wondered how his mother managed to satisfy her desire for education and how she managed to learn and speak French. His mother had been raised in a period of financial difficulties of her family, and education required money that her

parents could not afford. The tutors came in and out from her house as it was the case later with her own children. Moreover, the frequent relocations from place to place and then to the island of Syros, along with the domestic duties that she had taken on in order to help her mother and the old maid, did not leave space for study. However, despite these setbacks, her education stood on a high level thanks to the contribution of her brothers. Vikelas recollected that in the afternoons the plain dining room of his parental house was transformed into a study. Different subjects of school knowledge were given and enthusiasm was growing for everything that was useful. There, drills were corrected, poems were recited, and poets were expounded.143 Piano lessons and the French language were tutored to the young elite girls as part of their schooling. Penelope Delta recollected that she was ten when her father hired a French tutor from Paris to teach the language to her.144 As a rule, piano lessons and the French language were taught to the young elite girls as part of their schooling. However, according to Penelope’s mother who reflected the ideas of her milieu, schooling was ‘rather harmful’ than useful for a girl.145 Therefore, education served only the purpose of qualifying the girls with a good marriage as its role was decorative. Moreover, in the Greek community of Alexandria the relationship between parents and children was cold and distant. Kids were instructed to fully respect their parents and to behave according to the rules that a decent family of the upper middle classes was supposed to follow. But—at the same time—they did not receive attention from them as fathers were out of the house most of the day, and mothers were busy with outings in order to attend social events such as theater performances and parties. As a consequence, they did not have spare time to look after their children who were left to the hands of nannies. Because of this indifference and aloofness, the kids addressed to their governesses who turned an easy ear to listen to them. Indicative of this practice was Delta’s accounts of facts that she recalled that she had never seen her mother cajole her, nor encourage her to talk with her about her problems. The same applied to her father. They were both seen as two deities that the children worshipped. Parents were awe-inspiring and preferred to stay away from them. Penelope Delta’s mother was tall and beautiful, always elegant and—at the

same time—plainly dressed. She was accessible and friendly to everybody except for her children as she remained aloof as much as their father.146 In general terms, the mothers of the capitalist families were strict, authoritative, despotic, and commanding. They often punished their kids as they had assumed the full responsibility of their rearing and nurturing. They also had the upper hand in the management of their household and the full command of the servants. The elite ladies’ tasks also entailed checking on the kitchen and the cook. They were also in charge of the management of money they needed to run the house.147 Family ties were also strong in the case of single women. In the dispersed Greek merchants’ clan, unmarried women’s social position varied, depending on the social norms of the city where they had settled. In Vienna—for instance—at the turn of the eighteenth century, and because of its industrial growth, there were a lot of unmarried female workers who had relocated to the Austrian capital in order to find a placement in the factories of the nearby regions. These women stayed with families with whom they did not have any blood relations but they were only live-in. In the Greek Orthodox households there were no unmarried women that stayed with other families because the Greek community had fostered a ‘patriarchal-paternalistic’ attitude to this practice and the fact that they did not work outside their home, made them being dependent on their parental house.148 The more affluent families resided in bigger edifices than the less privileged ones. However, it was quite a common practice for Greek merchants to be away for a long time as they had to attend or to assume responsibilities in a branch of their firm abroad. In Vienna, 14 percent of the Orthodox households lived separately from fathers and husbands.149 D. Vikelas recalls that when he was very young, his family resided for a certain time period in Syros while his father and grandfather relocated abroad because they had to attend their firms. His father’s residence was in Constantinople and his grandfather’s in Taganrog. This was the norm because Vikelas’ father had to deal with the setting up of a firm in

Constantinople and to make it running. Later, he called his spouse and children to go and stay with him. The same applied to his grandfather.150 Another example was that of Katerina Betli, a married woman who lived in her parental home in Vienna as her husband—a Greek merchant—had settled in a region of the Ottoman Empire in order to closely attend his business ventures. However, he had not visited her for ten years.151 Katerina’s father, named Nikolaos Dimodoras, was a wealthy merchant. Katerina’s example illustrates the case of the spouse who shows full obedience, loyalty, and submissiveness to her husband. It also shows her compliance with his plans no matter how hard that might be. By contrast, a different case constitutes that of another married woman named Alexandra Martyri. In 1823, Alexandra left her husband and son and moved to a house that her lover—Theodore Rallis—had rented for her. Alexandra’s new residence was located in the neighborhood of Innenstadt in Vienna, close to her parental home as well as to her husband’s.152 Though these cases are different, they shared a common characteristic being that of married women living separately from their husbands for different reasons. It also explains the way people treated her. Alexandra’s story can be interpreted as an escape from her marital situation that signaled—at the same time—a violent breaking up of the moral code, hence, initiating a scandal. Her unlawful act called for punishment and—as a consequence—Anastasios Margaritis who was Alexandra’s father, disinherited her.153 We do not fully know-how the Greek community reacted to this incident but the element that two of Alexandra’s highly respected Greek friends in Vienna (Katerina Patsani and Zoes Charamis) publicly expressed and confirmed her wish that in the event of her death, her jewels be donated to her loverTheodore Rallis—shows that the community was—in a way—tolerant of wealthy people’s lifestyle and scandals. We must also take into consideration the fact that the other person involved in the scandal was also very rich and influential154 managing family-based thriving companies that were very well represented in many countries. So, wealth and influence counted

a lot in the Greek merchant communities and shaped new social norms.155 Apart from the power and size of the capital, the cultural background and the generation gap were significant factors as traced in Alexandra’s case. Seirinidou assumes that the act of Alexandra’s father in disinheriting her of the parental mobile and immobile assets, reflected an old-fashioned mentality and frame of ideas that did not exist in the younger generations. Additionally, it mirrored different attitudes among the trading clans that originated from diverse ethnic cultural background. Rallis’ origin was from Chios, while Margaritis originated from Epirus, an area in the Greek mainland. The Chiot communities were more open and adaptable to a new environment and to social challenges. By contrast, the Vlachs from Epirus were more reserved and less open. They believed that noncompliance with moral rules had to end up in punishment. However, the Chiots constituted a small community in Vienna compared to the Vlach merchants who outnumbered them.156 The Greek banker and great benefactor, Andreas Syggros, in his Memoirs described the Austrian capital as a cosmopolitan city with elegant and attractive women.157 The beautiful museums, the magnificent theaters, and the restaurants that served food of fine taste impressed him.158 It goes without saying that this lifestyle had been adopted by a lot of affluent diaspora Greek traders. The city’s international character that had been shaped accordingly due to the diversity of ethnic groups residing there was the reason for people’s more open systems of normative behavior, their ability to be more receptive and adaptive to novel ideas, and more apt to easily assimilate the diverse types of culture. This assimilation made Vienna a melting pot of multinational ethnicities of different backgrounds. Thus, the younger generations of the Greek merchants were more tolerant of a scandalous behavior than in other regions.
155 In London—for instance—the social stratification was formulated in the merchants’ clan according to the size of the wealth and the capital they possessed. An example is the annual catalog that was published by the Greek fraternity including a call for assembly and the subsequent election of new wardens of the Greek church. The list did not include the members’ names in an alphabetical order, but it was based on the principle of how big was the size of their business firm. The capitalist family who occupied the top positions in the catalog was Rallis family.

In line with Greek ethics, family patterns dictated that fathers were the head of the household, a tradition that was rarely broken in Greek communities. An exception was the case of widows who constituted the only category in the family system as heads of households that were not under parental guardianship. But even in this case there were limits.159 The Greek merchants’ spouses who relocated within the Habsburg Empire, where their husbands had settled in order to attend their business ventures, had to adapt to the new conditions. They adjusted themselves to their new country by maintaining traditions and values of their home. In Pest, for instance, the merchants’ wives kept friendly relations with other women who originated from the Balkans. This practice secured a firm surrounding for them by acting supportively either by means of giving, or by receiving assistance. In this context, these women succeeded in combining the shared values with which they had been imbued in their home, with the new social code that they had to follow in their new place of relocation.160 By 1770s, women usually were left behind with their children but later there was observed a tendency to relocate with their husbands to their new home. Moving to a new place was not an easy decision for women. There were cases in which husbands had to relocate in order to start over something new as they faced bankruptcy and debts at home. The relocation of the husband only in his new land secured him with more autonomy and gave him the free hand to act on his own without being burdened with family duties and expenses. The communication was not frequent, or even nonexistent in many cases. Often the wives who were left behind, did not receive financial support for themselves and for their children from their husbands. Indicative example of this situation was the case of a woman named Petzina Pondika. In 1767, Petzina decided to mortgage her house and travel to Pest in order to meet her husband, Triantafyllos. At the same time, she had in mind of claiming her financial share from him as she faced very hard economic problems.161 It was very usual for the wives like
159 According to a sample of twenty-nine widows, fourteen were heads of their family, while the rest lived with their blood relations or their son or son-in-law who was in charge of the management of the household. However, the young widows returned to their parental home after their husband’s death. See more in: Seirinidou, V., ibid., p. 106.

Petzina to be in hard financial situation as they did not receive economic assistance from their husbands because the latter had relocated in order to cope with their own mounting debts. Petzina decided to mortgage her belongings and go and meet her husband as the debts had left her without any other choice. Her difficult decision to go to Pest was dictated by pure financial character and by ‘sentimental deprivation’.162 Her decision was not easy as her relatives saw this initiative as ‘just a caprice’ that provoked their contempt. It also revealed the couple’s bad relations.163 As we can deduce from Petzina’s example, women had to face not only mounting debts because of their husbands’ unsuccessful trading activities and poor management but also loneliness and despair as they were left behind with no financial support, or even communication. Moreover, they had to come to terms with the existing social prejudices that dictated a certain mode of behavior and in case the subjects of social contempt did not follow the social norm, then they became—at least—the target of gossip in their family circle. In conclusion, the family ties of Greek dispersed merchants were very strong because family as a social institution attached great significance to shared values and traditions. Despite the fact that the Greek traders became naturalized by taking up the citizenship of the foreign country where they had relocated, they clung to their own identities and cultures. Moreover, they used to live in compact neighborhoods that consisted of residents of their own ethnicity and they did not mingle with the locals.164 According to E. Sifneos, women in particular—proved stronger than business differences. Family bonds cemented blood relations, and the branches of their companies were staffed with the kinship of the merchant-founder. Additionally, marital strategies held the main role in the expansion of the company.165 Women offered a considerable part of their dowry as a financial contribution—especially in cases when the family business faced bankruptcy—or when the male members planned to expand their business network. In this case, familiness was important as grandfathers kept their son’s children and wife under the roof of their own house for some time

period until they set up their new business venture and settled in the new land.166 Moreover, we saw that the mothers of capitalist households were willing to sell their jewels and personal assets if their family was in a hard financial situation.167 However, there was also a negative side: that of the young ‘Don Juan’ dowry-hunters (προικοθήρες). These men mainly sought to marry rich girls who possessed a big size of dowry that they all squandered in entertainment and parties. On this case, Andreas Syggros wrote in his Memoirs168 that he always pitied those young men whose main and foremost term of marriage was the amount of cash that they would receive as he had seen bad consequences because of this practice. He experienced wives’ enslavement, marital quarrels, and eventually the squandering of their premarital donations. And when these marriages failed, women became miserable, especially those who were used to living in luxury during the first years of married life and later they became destitute at a young age ending up in shameful acts because they were forced to do so for survival. Women often seemed to respond passively to family business practices. No matter if they financially contributed to their husbands’ business projects, they were imbued with the idea of being their husband’s passive pawns. As a reward, most of them led a carefree life following the pattern of the social norm of their milieu. However, behind the scene, many of them exerted pressure on their spouses in order to help their blood relatives, especially if the latter were financially weak. Viewing it from a feminist perspective we can see that the Greek elite women of the capitalist trading class did not seem willing to take part in the feminist movements that had started gaining ground in Europe and in the USA during the late nineteenth to early twentieth centuries. To the contrary, they followed the standard social norms of their business social circles. They did not seem to take advantage of their social standing in the family circle especially when their endowment became a crucial part in their husbands’ business ventures. The only initiative they took, was to act as the unvoiced

In this point we note the completely different view of the Russian Law that was first published in 1832 dictating that the ‘husband shall not acquire, through marriage, the right to use his wife’s property’. With this legislative decree women became independent in managing their dowries and in handling property matters.

contributors to their husbands’ prosperity in business by working silently and remaining in the shadow. One method—as mentioned above—was to offer their dowry for the setting up or for the expansion of family business networks. The other was their engagement in charity so as to boost their husbands’ profile in business, as well as in their political career that a number of them pursued.
