Was the Classical Gold Standard
Credible on the Periphery? Evidencefrom Currency Risk
Kris JAMES MITCHENER AND Marc D. WEIDENMIER
We use a standard metric from international finance, the currency risk premium, to assess the credibility of fixed exchange rates during the classical gold standard era. Theory suggests that a completely credible and permanent commitment to join the gold standard would have zero currency risk or no expectation of devaluation. We find that, even five years after a typical emerging-market country joined the gold standard, the currency risk premium averaged at least 220 basis points. Fixed-effects, panel-regression estimates that control for a variety of borrowerspecific factors also show large and positive currency risk premia. In contrast to core gold standard countries, such as France and Germany, the persistence of large premia, long after gold standard adoption, suggest that financial markets did not view the pegs in emerging markets as credible and expected that they devaluation.
he classical gold standard, the first truly international monetary system based on fixed exchange rates, emerged during the second half of the nineteenth century and lasted into the second decade of the twentieth century.' Scholars have long noted its importance in facilitating both trade and overseas investment during the first era of globalization,

1870-1913.* At its peak, more than 35 countries and colonies used gold to back domestic currency issues, accounting for roughly 70 percent of the world’s trade and 67 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP).* The classical gold standard continues to attract attention from scholars seeking to understand the durability of monetary institutions as well as the operation of fixed exchange-rate regimes.’ In a seminal paper, Michael Bordo and Finn Kydland (1995) established that joining the gold standard affects policymaking. Being on the gold standard tied the hands of the monetary and fiscal authorities of a country by committing them to a rule, which served as a credible commitment mechanism and solving the classic time-inconsistency problem (Kydland and Prescott 1977). Bordo and Hugh Rockoff (1996, p. 390) argued that the gold standard represented a “good housekeeping seal of approval,” allowing “peripheral” countries to borrow at lower interest rates as a result of committing to policies that signaled “financial rectitude.” Drawing on a quasi capitalasset pricing model, they used annual interest rates of long-term sovereign bonds from nine countries to explore the determinants of sovereign risk (also called “political risk” or “default risk”), which they defined as the differential between gold or sterling-denominated bonds in a country and the risk-free rate of borrowing (in this period, the British consol). Their research, as well as a subsequent study by Maurice Obstfeld and Alan Taylor (2003), which utilized data from a larger number of countries, found that country or sovereign risk was approximately 30-40 basis points lower for countries adhering to gold. Other research suggests that long-term borrowing costs were not significantly lower when countries adopted gold. Niall Ferguson and Moritz Schularick (2006) find that the gold standard effect disappears once the sample of sovereign borrowers is expanded to include the universe of debtors on the London market. In particular, they highlight the role of being part of an empire in reducing sovereign spreads. Using a sample of 55,000 sovereign bond returns, Ron Alquist and Benjamin Chabot (2011) find

There is a long line of theoretical work dating back to David Hume, which explores how the gold standard might deliver price and exchange rate stabilityautomatically eliminating balance of payments problems through adjustments in money, prices, and trade (Whale 1937; Bloomfield, 1959; Ford 1962; Scammell 1965; McCloskey and Zecher 1976).

no association between gold standard adherence and lower borrowing rates.° Many economists and historians of international finance consider the classical gold standard to be history’s most credible hard peg, in part because core-country governments credibly committed to maintain its existence and monetary authorities faced little political pressure to pursue countercyclical economic policies (Eichengreen 1997). Testing whether the gold standard was perceived by investors as credible requires data on the currency premium, which, unlike county risk, has been largely neglected in studies on the classical gold standard.° The currency-risk premium measures the compensation that an investor receives for expected movements in the exchange rate (Domowitz, Glen, and Madhavan 1998) and is particularly relevant for two reasons. First, its measurement allows one to assess directly whether investors perceived the gold standard as a credible fixed exchange rate regime. If financial markets do not consider a peg to be perfectly credible, then the currency risk premium will remain positive (Schmuckler and Serven 2002). Investors who priced in persistent and sizable currency risk premia during the gold standard era would hence be signaling that they believe countries would not maintain their pegs. Second, and more generally, advocates of hard pegs argue that their adoption will reduce currency risk premia, and if perfectly credible, may even eliminate them altogether. This would imply lower borrowing costs for emerging market countries, a feature that would perhaps make the adoption of hard pegs more desirable.’ Using a large, new data set of monthly and weekly short-term interest rates from the period 1870-1913 for 21 economies, we measure currency risk, which we define as the interest-rate differential between a borrower’s
> They focus on “excess returns,” and show that, after conditioning on U.K. risk factors, countries off gold did not have excess returns relative to those on gold. Their results appear to be robust to allowing for sensitivities of portfolios to U.K. risk factors to vary according to whether a country was on the gold standard, to including proxies that capture the effects of fiscal, monetary, and trade shocks on the commitment to gold, and to controlling for the effect of membership in the British Empire. ° Bordo and Flandreau (2003) provide a brief description of bank-rate spreads (relative to the United Kingdom) for five peripheral countries. Since their sample size is small and since they provide no formal tests of uncovered interest parity, it would be difficult to draw any general inferences about overall gold standard regime credibility on the periphery from this study. They suggest, inconclusively, that “going onto gold did not buy immediate credibility, as illustrated by the levels of short-term interest rates in a number of typical members of the periphery” (Bordo and Flandreau 2003, p. 434). It is unclear what this statement ultimately is meant to imply about gold standard credibility on the periphery. 7 Additionally, fixed exchange rates that are credible may reduce the probability of speculative attacks and contagion.

open market rate and the short-term, domestic U.K. trade bill.’ Our results suggest that joining the gold club did not eliminate currency risk for emerging market borrowers. We find that short-term interest rate differentials persisted long after adoption. Five years after a typical emerging market economy joined the gold standard—the currency-risk premium averaged 220 basis points. Our findings build on earlier scholarship that has noted that the gold standard may have operated differently on the periphery.’ Even when controlling for country-specific factors that may also explain the variation in currency risk premia, such as wars, market liquidity, colonial status, and debt default, we find no evidence that gold standard adoption eliminated currency-risk permia on the periphery. The average currency risk premium for an emerging market economy remained more than 220 basis points years after its adoption. The existence and persistence of large currency risk premia for these borrowers suggest that financial markets believed that these hard pegs were not credible and devaluations would occur in the future. Our calculations suggested that investors expected exchange rates for emerging market borrowers to fall by 28 percent over any 90-day period.
MEASURING CURRENCY RISK
Bordo and Kydland (1995) provide an interpretation of the role of the gold standard as it relates to this literature on rules for policymakers. They argue that being on the gold standard tied the hands of the fiscal and monetary authorities of a country. Indeed, a monetary rule like a fixed exchange rate could serve as a credible commitment mechanism for solving the classic time-inconsistency problem (Kydland and Prescott 1977). The existence of an enforcement mechanism, such as a credible threat to deny the government access to borrowing in the future, means that a socially optimal, but time inconsistent policies can be supported as an equilibrium outcome. This can occur whena policy plan that is determined to be optimal and to hold indefinitely into the future is subsequently revised. For example, suppose that a government sells debt to finance a war. From an ex ante perspective, it is optimal for the government to service its debt obligations. However, once the bonds have been sold, it is optimal for the government to default. In the absence of a commitment

mechanism, it is time inconsistent for the government to repay its debt obligations. Private agents will anticipate the government’s incentive to default and they will not buy bonds, forcing the government to rely on taxes or money creation. Bordo and Kydland (1995) also argue that the gold standard had an escape clause. Countries could suspend specie convertibility in the event of a war or fiscal emergency; however, after the war or extraordinary event ended, it was well understood that a country would return to specie convertibility at the pre-war parity. Generally, resumption occurred after a “reasonable” delay period during which a country would impose deflationary policies to retire fiat currency printed for war or emergency finance.'° Using this theoretical insight that a fixed exchange rate regime represents a commitment rule, we assess the credibility of hard pegs for emerging market borrowers. In particular, we examine the behavior of interest rates on short-term debt instruments from 1870-1913 in order to calculate and analyze the currency risk premium for the classical gold standard era. The currency risk premium provides an estimate of the compensation that bondholders demand in the case of an expected devaluation. Using long-term bond prices, previous research on the gold standard has largely focused on country risk, which is an assessment of the default risk for an emerging market borrower."' To understand how the currency risk premium relates to anticipated changes in the exchange rate, we define /,, as the interest rate at time t of a short-term debt instrument for a borrowerk (either a country or a colony) that is payable in domestic currency. We define i” as the base country interest rate at time ¢, which is proxied by U.K. trade bills that are payable in pound sterling. The maturity of both short-term debt instruments is equal to 90 days for the borrowers in our sample. Furthermore, we assume that capital is mobile and that the emerging market country and U.K. short-term debt instruments are perfectly substitutable. The short-term interest rates have no default risk and risk-neutral investors hold both assets. The exchange rate is expected to adjust such that the return on the emerging market asset is equal to the return on the U.K. short-term trade
0 The United States and France provide examples of the use of escape clauses. They fought wars in the 1860s and 1870s and issued large amounts of irredeemable paper currency and debt. At the conclusion of these wars, both countries imposed deflationary policies to restore convertibility, and both had returned to specie standards by 1880. ' See Bordo and Rockoff (1996), Obstfeld and Taylor (2003), Ferguson and Schularick (2006), and Flandreau and Zimer (2004). As noted earlier, Bordo and Flandreau (2003) briefly discuss short-term interest rate differentials, although they do not define this as the currency risk premium.

bill. Under these assumptions, the currency risk premium can be written as the interest-rate differential between the emerging market security and the U.K. trade bill:
(i,,- i) =pdr, (1)
where p is the likelihood of an exchange devaluation and dé is the size of the expected devaluation. Equation (1) is an uncovered interest parity (UIP) condition where the currency risk premium equals the expected rate of change in the exchange rate over 90 days.'* Hence, if a country made a completely credible, non-contingent, and permanent commitment to join the gold standard, then the probability of a devaluation of the exchange rate would be zero (Obstfeld and Taylor 2003). That is, for a borrower that credibly committed to the gold standard, the interest-rate differential between its 90-day open market rate and 90-day British trade bills should be zero. Once the gold standard is introduced, the existence of a persistent and large spread between these two short-term interest rates would suggest that financial markets did not view the commitment to the exchange-rate peg as a credible for country k. Using interest-parity conditions to identify the currency risk premium is conceptually straightforward. However, it is often empirically difficult to implement. For example, the presence of capital controls (or the expectation of capital controls) can drive a wedge between the price of short-term interest rates trading in local and foreign markets. Indeed, it is the widespread use of capital controls after the 1930s that has made it challenging to measure currency risk for that time period. By contrast, the classical gold standard era had unfettered capital markets, largely free of government intervention (Eichengreen 1997; International Monetary Fund 1997), making our period of analysis particularly well suited for testing the credibility of hard pegs. To analyze the credibility of the gold standard in emerging markets, we assembled a new database of high-frequency, short-term interest rates for 21 economies, in total roughly 250,000 observations.'? The shortterm open market rates were widely regarded as liquid and low-risk debt

'S With the exception of British India, colonies are not included in the sample since most of them did not have developed secondary markets where these credit instruments would trade. As a result, we are unable to obtain short-term interest rates for Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa for the gold standard period.

instruments during the classical gold standard period. Much of our data is hand-collected from contemporaneous financial publications. The database includes the universe of open market rates reported in The Economist from 5 November 1870 until 30 June 1914.'*Open market rates reflect the interest rate on funds used to finance commerce during the gold standard period (Neal and Weidenmier 2003); they are the historical equivalent of a banker’s acceptance today. These credit instruments were payable in domestic currency and issued in the leading money centers. For emerging market borrowers that lacked open market rates, we collected data on the bank rate—the short-term interest rate used by a central bank to discount private credit of a short duration. Our use of the central bank discount rate is based on the fact that central banks discounted large number of short-term bills; hence, these instruments were highly liquid. Moreover, default risk associated with central banks is likely to be very low. Convertibility under the gold standard was generally established by law or executive decree. In a few cases, such as France and the AustroHungarian Empire, maintenance of convertibility was left to the discretion of policymakers. Table 1 presents a timeline of gold standard adoption for every country that joined the gold standard in the period 1870-1914 and had short-term interest rates. (Source information is shown in Appendix 2.) Column2 lists the dates of gold standard adoption, defined as the date a monetary authority initiated or resumed specie convertibility. Column 3 shows the period of gold standard adherence for 21 borrowers. By confining our analysis to countries or colonies that remained on the gold standard for at least two years, we provide a lower-bound estimate of currency risk.!° The Economist reports annualized rates for both types of short-term debt instruments in our study. Appendix | describes the particular shortterm interest rate used. For each borrower, we collected monthly or weekly quotes, whichever had the highest frequency as reported by the
'4 We supplement data from The Economist with short-term interest rates from The Commercial and Financial Chronicle, the Manchester Guardian as well as information contained in central bank publications for Argentina, Greece, and Finland. There are a few gold standard adopters on the periphery for which we lack data on short-term rates (Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Peru, and Turkey). ’ The two-year decision rule eliminates short-lived attempts by Argentina, Brazil, and Greece to join the gold standard during the late nineteenth century, which may have never been perceived by markets as credible. This ensures we are not biasing our results toward finding currency-risk persistence in the sample. The estimated average currency risk premium for emerging market borrowers would be higher if these countries were included.

the gold-dominated U.K. trade bill. Table 2 presents currency risk premia for 21 economies. Panels A and B report average interest-rate differentials (in basis points) for the entire period and for ten-year and four-year windows around gold standard adoption dates. The fourth column displays the change in the risk premia, comparing the five-year or two-year period before adoption with the five-year or two-year period after joining gold. These windows are designed to measure long-run adherence to the gold standard by first calculating the currency risk premium at the weekly or monthly frequency. Then, we average the point-in-time estimates over the ten- and four-year windows to provide an unconditional measure of long-term credibility since that theory predicts that, after adoption, currency risk will, on average, be zero if the fixed-exchange rate regime is viewed as credible by financial markets.'’ Figures | and 2 show tenyear windows (or the largest available sample period) for 21 economies centered around the adoption date of the gold standard with weeks (or months) from that date shown on the x-axis. Declines in currency risk prior to adoption may reflect fiscal and monetary policy reforms made with the intention of improving the credibility of their fixed-exchange rate regimes. Panel A of Table 2 shows that the currency risk premium for France was slightly negative and hardly different from the rate on British trade bills (9 basis points) five years after the country joined the gold standard. Panel B shows similar results for the four-year window; after adoption, the currency risk premium averaged —15 basis points. The data for France suggest that markets viewed this peg as credible. Borrowing rates for Germany averaged ten basis points five years after adoption. Markets also appear to have assessed the pegs of a few other western European countries as fairly credible. Over the five years after Belgium and Netherlands pegged, the currency risk premia averaged 33 and 30 basis points, respectively. On the other hand, despite its level of development, our findings suggest that financial markets viewed the United States differently. Its currency risk premium averaged more than 200 basis points in the five years after it joined the gold standard. Even if we extend this analysis to cover the entire classical gold standard era, up until the outbreak of World War I, the currency risk premium for the United States averaged more than 150 basis points.
"” Officer (1989) estimates that the costs of importing gold were 0.69 percent ofparity and 0.61 percent of parity for gold exports between the United States and the United Kingdom during the classical gold standard period. The cost of transporting gold between two countries is a transaction cost that limits interest parity from holding precisely during the period 1870-1913.

respectively, for Bulgaria, Greece, and Rumania in the two-year period after they adopted gold. Even five years after these three countries joined the gold standard, the premia stood at 384, 232, and 241 basis points.

Table 3 provides a robustness check by showing the average currency risk premia for seven countries on the gold standard for which we have data on the central bank discount rate as well as the open market rate. By using this subset of countries for which we have both types of rates, we are able to examine whether the results are sensitive to the data we employ. As Table 3 shows, the individual country differences are relatively minor when using either type of interest rate, and the average currency risk after gold standard adoption across all seven countries is identical under both measures—100 basis points. Our findings, therefore, do not appear to be driven by data selection. As a final robustness check, we also calculated the currency risk premium for a sample of gold and paper bonds issued by the same country during the classical gold standard period. The basic tenor of the results remains unchanged: emerging market borrowers exhibit large and persistent currency risk premia in the long-term bond market after they adopted the gold standard.'® Overall, the time-series evidence suggests that the gold standard was likely credible for a small set of core European countries that included France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Belgium. A very different picture, however, emerges for other countries in the sample. Outside the core countries, the currency risk premium averaged more than 285 basis points five years after a country joined the gold

standard, with a standard deviation of 163 points.!? The currency risk premium for emerging market countries was greater than zero about 82 percent of the time. These new estimates of currency risk appear consistent with descriptive accounts of the operation of the gold standard on the periphery that it may have been more difficult for these countries to adhere to policies set by the core countries of the gold standard (Bordo and Kydland 1995; Eichengreen 1996).
TESTS OF UNCOVERED INTEREST RATE PARITY
To examine whether pegged exchange rates were credible during the gold standard, we use equation (4) and test for UIP in the sample of emerging market borrowers. We regress the short-term interest rate of country 7 in period ¢ on a constant and the British trade bill in period t (the base country). Because the sample periods in the single-country regressions correspond to when countries were on the gold standard (see Table 1), we can apply the UIP condition in a straightforward way. The no-arbitrage condition implies that the base rate should capture all the relevant movements in the interest rate of the borrowing country. Hence, if the peg is credible, then the estimated constant term should be zero and statistically insignificant. To implement UIP tests, we first explore the time series properties of the data. As seen in Table 4, DF-GLS tests reject the existence of a unit root in 16 of the 21 countries in our sample at standard confidence intervals. For the five countries that do not pass the unit root test (Argentina, Bulgaria, Chile, Greece, and Russia), we find additional evidence of a co-integrating relationship, suggesting stationarity in all the data series we consider.”° The estimated coefficients on the constant terms shown in Table 5 (and measured in percentage points) are large and statistically significantly different from zero at the 1-percent level in all regressions. The
'° Adding the United States to the set of “core” countries has the effect of raising the average for emerging market borrowers from 285 to 290 basis points. » The Engle-Granger Cointegration results suggest that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship between the U.K. open market rate and the short-term interest rates for Argentina and Bulgaria at the 5 percent level of significance. There is long-run equilibrium relationship between the Japanese and Russian short-term interest rates with the U.K. trade bill rate at the 10 percent level of significance. We also did not explicitly test for a co-integrating relationship for Chile and Greece with the U.K. interest rate since the gold standard period was less than four years. The empirical results for Chile and Greece, however, did not suggest the presence of spurious relationship given that the R-squared did not approach one in the UIP regressions.

constant is more than 400 basis points for most countries.”!' Chile has a constant greater than 900 basis points, while the intercept for Bulgaria, Greece, Mexico, and Japan is more than 600 basis points. Finland, India, Norway, Rumania, Russia, and Russia have estimated currency risk premia greater than 400 basis points. The estimated intercept for Austria, Denmark, Italy, and Sweden is between 290 and 400 basis points. Switzerland and the United States are the most credible hard pegs among emerging markets, with respective currency risk premia of 213 and 238 basis points. The estimated coefficients on the intercept term show that UIP conditions were not satisfied in emerging market economiessuggesting that market participants did not perceive their pegs to be credible.
PANEL DATA ESTIMATES OF CURRENCY RISK
To understand the extent to which country-specific factors account for the observed variation in currency risk, we constructed a monthly panel data set for the 21 borrowers over the sample period 1870-1914. We estimate the following equation:
CURRENCYRISK,, = 0. + B,INTRASTATE+, BINTERSTATE, (2)
+ B,INDIA, + B,CENTRALBANK,, + B,STOCKMARKET,
+ B,DEFAULT, + B,GOLD,,+y,+A,+€,,
where CURRENCYRISK, is the current yield on a short-term debt instrument for borrower i at time t minus the current yield on the British shortterm trade bill and @ is a country-specific intercept. We note that the test of the UIP condition will differ in the panel setting because the sample period spans the entire gold standard era and many countries joined after 1870. As a result, there are two key coefficients to consider for the UIP tests. The first is the date at which borrowers adopted gold (GOLD), a time-varying indicator variable denoting when the borrower was on the gold standard. GOLD indicates how much currency risk fell with the adoption of gold. If the gold standard conferred complete credibility, then its inclusion ought to eliminate the currency risk premium entirely. The

second is the time-varying constant term, which as before, will be zero and statistically insignificant if the peg is credible. Since we have already established that it is positive and statistically significant in single-country regressions, the panel regressions provide an additional robustness check of our finding that the gold standard was not credible for emerging market economies. The inclusion of borrower-specific economic and political factors as well as fixed-effects models allows us also to relax certain assumptions of UIP discussed earlier, such as default risk and liquidity risk across countries. In specifications omitting country dummies, y,, we include a dummy variable for INDIA since it is part of the British Empire.” Because political events may also affect a variety of risk spreads, we include two measures of conflict using data from the Correlates of War database. INTRASTATE is an indicator variable, capturing years when the borrower was engaged in a conflict that predominantly took place within the recognized territory of that state and combatant fatalities were at least 1,000 within a 12-month period. The Russian Bloody Sunday (1905-1906) and the Romanian Peasant Rebellion (1907) are examples of intrastate wars meeting this threshold. The INTERSTATE indicator variable equals one when a state was at war with another colony or country, and sustained combat resulted in a minimum of 1,000 battlerelated combatant fatalities within a 12-month period (Correlates of War Database). Examples include the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895) and the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871). We also include two time-varying, borrower-specific variables that proxy for market liquidity and financial development: STOCKMARKET and CENTRAL BANK. All else equal, short-term interest rates will be lower for countries with more liquid financial markets. The presence of a stock market indicates institutional development that would promote liquidity. The presence of either a stock market or a central bank indicates development of modern financial institutions.* Finally, because risk spreads may be affected by periods of domestic financial turmoil, we coded an indicator variable that takes a value of one if a country has at least one sovereign debt issue that is in default at time ¢.** Year dummies,

i, are included in all specifications to capture the impact of international financial crises such as those occurring in the 1870s, 1890s, and 1907 as well as other time-varying economic factors that might influence the currency risk premium. Regressions are estimated with robust standard errors clustered at the country level. Column 1 of Table 6 shows the results for the simple ordinary least square (OLS) pooled regression with year dummies. Three independent variables are statistically significant at conventional levels. Joining the gold standard appears to decrease the currency risk premium by almost 167 basis points. Debt default raises the currency risk premium by 112 basis points. Finally, our proxy for liquidity, STOCKMARKET, reduces the interest rate spread by nearly 192 basis points. When we include country fixed effects and consider the fullyinteracted model (column 2), GOLD and STOCKMARKET are no longer statistically significant, suggesting that the identification of these effects was from the cross-sectional variation. However, once we examine the within variation and control for unobserved differences across countries, the economic effects of adopting the gold standard are small in magnitude (less than ten basis points) and statistically insignificant. Debt default remains statistically significant at the 10-percent level. On the other hand, the constant term, which captures currency risk, remains statistically significant and economically meaningful—at more than 179 basis points. Because the full sample includes some countries that are more economically developed, in the second two columns of Table 6, we consider specifications that exclude Belgium, France, Germany, and the Netherlands from the sample and focus on less-developed borrowers. The results using the sample of emerging market borrowers (columns 3 and 4) are qualitatively similar, but as expected, the average currency risk shown by the constant term is larger: 343 and 221 basis points in the pooled OLS and fixed effects, respectively. Thus, even after we control for time-specific shocks as well as for observed and unobserved differences across countries, we continue to find a large average currency risk premium for emerging market borrowers. Because the sample uses a mixture of open market rates and discount rates for emerging market borrowers, as a final robustness check, we re-estimate the specifications using only the ten countries that have open market rates (as listed in Appendix 1). Open market rates constitute approximately 52 percent of our sample of interest rates. As reported in Table 7, the estimated coefficients for GOLD and the constant term, the

IMPLIED DEVALUATIONS FOR EMERGING MARKET ECONOMIES
Following the methodology proposed in Sergio Schmuckler and Luis Serven (2002), we estimate the size of the anticipated devaluation for our sample of 17 emerging market economies. Dividing the currency risk premium by the probability of a fall in the exchange rate yields the anticipated size of the devaluation:
dé =(i,,—i,,)/ p. (3)
As equation (3) shows, when the probability of a devaluation is higher, it reduces the size of the exchange rate movement. The probability of devaluation was likely influenced by a combination of countryspecific shocks (such as those to a country’s terms of trade or to fiscal

policy) as well as common shocks operating across countries, such as financial crises. As the size of shocks or frequency of them increased, emerging market borrowers faced a greater risk of abandoning their hard pegs. Providing data on each country’s fiscal and terms of trade shocks is beyond the scope of this article; however, we can use Bordo and Antu Murshid’s (2006) annual estimates of the likelihood of a global financial crisis during the gold standard era to shed light on the expected devaluations implied by our measures of currency risk. They estimate that the likelihood of a crisis between 1870-1914 was between 10 and 14 percent. Using the lower of these two figures, Table 8

then computes the expected size of the devaluation for each of the 17 emerging-market economies. As the last row of the table shows, across all emerging-market economies, the data suggest that markets anticipated that exchange rates would fall by an average of more than 28 (annualized) percent over a 90-day period. Since the standard deviation of the currency risk premium is 16 percent, the estimated size of the decline in the exchange rate varies significantly across the sample. We estimate expected devaluations of more than 20 percent over 90 days for countries or colonies such as Argentina, Austria, Bulgaria, Chile, Greece, India, Japan, Mexico, Norway, Rumania, Russia, Sweden, and the United States.
CONCLUSION
Between 1870 and 1913, the gold standard was widely adopted, even by countries on the periphery. Given its global reach, the classical gold standard thus represents the most widely used peg in modern financial history. Focusing on country-specific risk, previous studies have argued that the regime appeared credible, at least among core countries. As we demonstrate, however, currency risk provides a more accurate assessment as to whether financial markets believed a country would maintain its pegged exchange rate. We take advantage of the fact that from 1870-1913 capital markets were unfettered. Since governments did not impose capital controls, we are able to identify currency risk premia using interest-rate parity conditions. To measure whether the gold standard was credible, we examined whether interest-rate differentials existed and persisted between an emerging market economies and a base economy, the United Kingdom. Using a new database of weekly and monthly short-term interest rates, we analyze the currency risk premium for a sample of 17 emerging market economies during the gold standard era. The empirical analysis suggests that the currency risk premium for these non-core economies averaged more than 220 basis points in the five-year period after they joined the gold standard. Standard uncovered interest parity tests show the existence of a large currency risk premia. These large risk premia do not disappear even when we control for timevarying, country-specific factors such as wars, market liquidity, colonial status, and debt default as well as for unobserved country specific factors captured in our fixed-effects estimates. Panel regressions also

show that the results are not sensitive to the particular type of shortterm credit instrument used. We find that there are large currency risk premia regardless of whether we use open market rates or central bank discount rates. Given the presence of common shocks that influenced the likelihood of devaluation, such as global financial crises, our analysis implies that financial markets expected the exchange rates to depreciate on average by approximately 28 (annualized) percent over any three-month period between 1870-1913. These findings suggest that for emerging markets, the gold standard was not credible because a high level of currency risk persisted long after gold standard adoption.
