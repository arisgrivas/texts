Abstract
Everyone must have experienced a huge collection of political content on their social media account’s home page during election time. Most of the users are busy in liking, sharing, and commenting political posts on the social media platform at that time, and these user activities show their attitude or behaviour towards the electoral or the political party. This study has mined the collective behaviour of Twitter users towards the Indian General election 2019. This work performed weekly sentiment analysis of massive Twitter content related to electoral and political parties during election time using a lexiconbased sentiment analysis approach. Based on this empirical study, the aim is to find out the feasibility of election prediction through social media analysis in a developing country like India. Further, an explorative analysis has been performed on the collected data, which gives answers to some dominant research hypotheses formulated in this paper. This paper shows how public mood can be gauged from social media content during the election period and how it can be considered as a parameter to predict the election results along with other factors. In addition, results evaluation has been done based on mean absolute error by considering the vote share and seat share of competing parties and leaders in the election. The predicted result of this work has been compared with exit poll results from various news agencies and the actual election result. It was found that our result of election prediction is quite similar to the final election results.

1 Introduction
Since the last decade, social media have become a part of peoples’ lives. In this digital world, every second, a huge amount of data is generated by social media users. This massive amount of data has the capability to mine human behaviour (Batista-Navarro et al. 2013). The power and engagement of social media networks cannot be neglected in election prediction because, as we can see alone in India, all the political parties have set up IT and social media cells to promote their electoral, slogans, and campaigns on social media platforms to attract voters. This paper has tried to mine the behaviour, attitude, or opinion of Twitter users towards different electoral and political parties that participated in the Indian General Election 2019. Sentiment analysis is a sub-discipline of Natural Language Processing (NLP) that analyse text to find its sentiment. In this paper, Twitter data is considered as a sample for analysing the sentiments of users and predicting the election results, which is way better than a field survey.

The field survey for the election prediction needs more time and money, whereas analysing people’s views through social media covers more people in less time and at a low cost. There are 34.4 million Twitter users in India, and among them, there are 7.91 million active Twitter users (Statista 2015; Clement 2020). Moreover, Twitter has become a platform for politicians to interact directly with people by communicating and sharing messages and running various campaigns. We have used a lexicon-based approach to perform sentiment analysis of the English-language tweets related to the Indian general election. Other methods to perform sentiment analysis are the machine learning-based approach and hybrid approach mentioned in (D’Andrea et al. 2015; Yusof et al. 2015; Hemmatian and Sohrabi 2017). We are not using these approaches because of the unavailability of the example dataset for any Indian election. Further, this paper tries to assess the power of sentiment analysis in predicting election results at the national level and shows how social media may be used as a resource for election prediction. In this paper, it is assumed that the user’s positive tweets toward an electoral or a party means the user will more likely vote for that electoral or party. Most of the researchers have used Twitter data for the prediction of election outcomes by using various methods (Gayo-Avello 2013; Jungherr and Jungherr 2016; Chauhan et al. 2021). From (Gayo-Avello 2013), it was found that out of ten, only three researchers did cleansing of collected data for election prediction. In our work, we have done data pre-processing to remove retweets and duplicate tweets, which could affect the candidate’s or party’s final popularity by counting a wrong number of redundant positive or negative tweets. Second, we believe the right amount of data can give more insights when analysing or predicting. In respect of this, we analysed that previous studies (as mentioned in Table 1) have used only candidate or party names to collect the data and make election predictions after processing that data, but we have comprehensively collected data related to competing parties, their leaders, their campaigns, and trending political hashtags during the election period and processed it. In addition to this, we have analysed and predicted the election results by considering candidatewise vote share, and party-wise & alliance-wise seat share whereas previous studies only considered either partywise or candidate-wise seat share or vote share to predict election results. In addition to this, previous studies did not provide information about considering threshold which plays a very important role in the sentiment classification of tweets. We are the first who observed and compared sentiment classification results based on polarity threshold values. The main contributions of this work are given below:
a. The work gauged the sentiments of Twitter users towards the 2019 Indian General election using a lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach. b. Explorative analysis of the collected data mined dominant insights during the election period and tested various research hypotheses related to the Indian general election. c. The proposed methodology shows the effect of taking two threshold values when examining tweets for election prediction. d. The empirical results show the proximity between our results and existing exit poll results from various news agencies/channels. e. To the best of our knowledge, this work stands out to be the first as it focuses on a candidate-wise, party-wise, and alliance-wise (a comprehensive) evaluation of the Indian election by considering vote share and seat share. f. MAE (Mean Absolute Error) score that we have achieved in this study shows the correctness of our work and also shows that our work is competitive with the pre-exit poll and traditional survey results.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives an introduction to the various terminologies used. This section also briefly introduces the Indian general election, its duration, names of participating parties and alliances, and highlights of the previous year’s election result. Section 3 introduces seven research hypotheses related to the 2019 Indian election. The research questions in this section are the core objectives of this research work. Further, Sect. 4 gives a literature review of the studies related to advancements in sentiment analysis, election prediction, stance detection, and research challenges in the field of election prediction. Following this, Sect. 5 explains the methodology adopted to perform election prediction using the sentiment analysis process. Section 6 displays various results related to the sentiments of Twitter users towards different parties and candidates considered during the election period and tests the hypotheses formulated. In Sect. 7, the evaluation of results is done by calculating the mean absolute error and by comparing our empirical results with other news agencies’ exit poll results. Further, this section points to the major findings of this research paper summarized in previous sections. Finally, Sect. 8 concludes the paper.
2 Indian general (Lok Sabha) election 2019
Before starting further, here is an introduction to some terminologies which has been used throughout the paper. Lok Sabha election or General election is the election for the lower house of the parliament in India, electoral or leader or candidate is the Prime Ministerial (PM) candidate of a political party, Mahagathbandhan (MGB) is an alliance of

national and regional parties, Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP) and Indian National Congress (INC) aka Congress are two main national-level political parties in India. National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and United Progressive Alliance (UPA) are two different alliances led by BJP and INC, respectively. Indian Lok Sabha election 2019 was held in seven phases from 11 April to 19 May 2019 to constitute the 17th Lok Sabha. Figure 1 gives a quick view of various parties, alliances, and PM candidates in the election. This election was one of the most popular elections because, in 2014, Modi led BJP had swept the Congress Government by becoming the first party to win the majority of seats in over last three decades. Also, it had to be seen whether the Modi wave would be useful at this time or not. In addition, many opposition leaders made an effort to unite non—NDA parties to ally Mahagathbandhan (The great alliance) for the sacking of the Modi Government. Further, the world’s largest democratic country was going to elect the Prime Minister, and over 900 million electors were eligible to participate in this election (ECI 2019a). Lok Sabha, or the House of the people in the lower house of the Indian parliament and its members are elected by the adult suffrage system (LokSabha 2020). In India, there are seven national political parties named INC, BJP, All India Trinamool Congress (AITC), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), Communist Party of India (CPI), Communist Party of India Marxist (CPIM), and Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) as shown in Fig. 1. All the parties have their national importance, but BJP and INC are the two main front-runner parties. After every five years, Lok Sabha elections are conducted by the Election Commission of India (ECI) to elect members of the parliament. BJP and INC parties have a coalition with other regional, state, and national parties named NDA and UPA, respectively. If we look at the results of previous Lok Sabha elections for 2004 and 2009, UPA defeated NDA and remained in power for ten (10) years. In 2014, NDA defeated UPA and came into power. Appendix A shows the two major alliances of NDA and UPA, led by BJP and INC, respectively and some
other alliances by regional parties for the general election of 2019 (India Today 2019).
3 Motivation and research hypotheses
India is a country of different cultures, skins, languages, and religious societies. It is the most populous democratic country in the world, where every citizen’s single vote decides the ruling party for the next 5 years. Also, India is the second-largest population-holding country in the world after China. So, these things influenced and motivated authors to perform this task of prediction to reveal which party will win the election and whether Twitter can reflect election results. Many research questions arose in our minds related to; Twitter’s capability to gauge the reflection of various political events, the sudden popularity of an electoral and its effect on the party, the interaction between people and leaders/party, and various campaigns run by BJP & INC to promote their party and candidates during election time. Various research questions that strike the author’s mind are given below.
• Does Twitter data have the potential to predict the election results at the national level in the most populous democratic country? • Is Twitter data able to see the impact of political events on the popularity of electoral or parties? • Is there any relationship between the popularity of the electoral and his party? • To whom did the main two parties (BJP and INC) and PM candidates interact during election time over Twitter? • Which types of tweets (positive or negative) were retweeted frequently, corresponding to different electoral and their parties? • Which party campaigns were more positive during the election time, and what was the users' view toward campaigns run by different political parties?

• Does taking two threshold values for tweets classification effect the final prediction results?
Based on the research questions stated above, we make related hypotheses and also justify them, as given below.
1. Twitter data have the potential to predict the 2019 General Indian election results.
Reason: We are living in a data age, where most people give their views over social media applications. Twitter has become a platform where political communications and deliberations have become very common thing. People post their feelings to promote or demote leaders and parties and give their views about trending hashtags and other events. In addition, the election prediction studies in the literature (related work) section shows that most studies make the right prediction by analysing Twitter data. Therefore, the authors believe that Twitter can predict the election results of a developing country like India.
2. Twitter data can be analysed to show the impact of political events on the popularity of electoral or parties.
Reason: When a political or non-political event happens in the country, always a trending hashtag related to that event has been seen on Twitter. Authors believe that political event happenings and trending hashtag data will have a direct relationship.
3. There will be a direct relationship between the popularity of the electoral and his party.
Reason: Authors believe that Twitter data will be able to give a direct relationship between the popularity of the electoral and his party.
4. The main two parties (BJP and INC) and PM candidates will reply more to the general public during election time.
Reason: Authors believe that to seek the attention of people, main leaders and parties will try to reply to common Twitter users.
5. Mostly negative views and posts will be shared among people.
Reason: Authors believe that most of the time, negativity is shared more on social media platforms.
6. Analysing Twitter campaigns run by various parties will be helpful in predicting election results.
Reason: Leaders and party members try to promote their parties. Therefore, analysing user views about those campaigns will determine the party's popularity, which would be further helpful in predicting election results.
7. Taking two threshold values for sentiment classification of collected tweets will affect the positivity or popularity rate of leaders and parties.
Reason: We believe that using different threshold values for the classification of the same tweets will affect the popularity rate of different variables/entities. All these hypotheses are tested by visualizing and comparing the positive polarity (popularity) of different variables, as shown in section 6.
4 Related work
Election prediction found its roots in the early 80s and has evolved from disciplines like sociology, political science, and economics. The earlier models tried to predict elections based on the economy, unemployment rate, polls, gross domestic product (GDP), popularity, and winning seats in previous elections. The prediction models which depend upon these above-said factors are also called statistical models. These models lacked knowledge of human behaviour and their opinions towards a particular electoral or political party. One option for finding human opinion about the electoral and corresponding party is doing a field survey where analysts go to places and try to get peoples’ opinion towards the electoral and their belonging parties, but this process is very expensive and time-consuming. Nowadays, the other choice to analyse human opinion is utilizing social media data, which is real and freely available. In addition, analysing this data also costs less in terms of manpower and money as compared to field surveys. Thus, with the evolution of social media platforms and the availability of data, researchers have started mining social media data for the election prediction task. Hence, human sentiments towards electoral or their parties from the social media content can be incorporated as another parameter to the statistical models (as discussed above) for the election prediction task. In many previous papers, as shown in Table 1, the prediction of elections through social media has been performed using sentiment analysis or volumetric or social network analysis approach or sometimes a combination of them (Jaidka et al. 2019). This section highlights some important studies that revolve around election result prediction since the 2000s, and more studies can be found in (Prasetyo and Hauff 2015; Chauhan et al. 2021; Khan et al. 2021).

4.1 Sentiment analysis and recent advancements
The roots of sentiment analysis are considered to be found in text subjectivity analysis and opinion mining analysis, which started in the 1990s and 2000s, respectively (Mäntylä et al. 2018). Also, an increasing boom has been seen in the field of sentiment analysis and opinion mining since 2000 (Mäntylä et al. 2018; Keramatfar and Amirkhani 2019). According to Mika and others, 99% of the papers in this field were published after the year 2004 (Mäntylä et al. 2018). Sentiment analysis has been used in several studies to mine reviews, attitudes, and opinions and analyse the cumulative stance of users towards given entities such as a product, person or service. It has applications in various fields, such as box office prediction, stock rate prediction, business analysis, and election prediction (Medhat et al. 2014; JavanAmoli and Bagheri 2016; Liu et al. 2016). Machine learning and Deep learning have contributed new advancements in the field of sentiment analysis, which is proven to give more accurate results (Ain et al. 2017; Chauhan and Singh 2017; Chen et al. 2019; Habimana et al. 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Ligthart et al. 2021). Moreover, multilingual, multimodal, and visual sentiment analysis are the hot research areas in the field of sentiment analysis, where images, videos, and audio, along with text, add more values for the correct sentiment analysis (Cambria 2016; Corchs et al. 2019; Huddar et al. 2019; Priyavrat et al. 2021).
4.2 Election prediction
Bermingham and Smeaton used Twitter data to analyse its predictive power in the 2011 Irish election (Bermingham and Smeaton 2011). The study used a combination of volumetric and sentiment analysis approaches to monitor social media content in the election. The prediction results were evaluated using conventional election polls and the final actual election results. The study found that Twitter data display predictive quality with the marginal inclusion of sentiments of the content. Shi et al. used Twitter data for the prediction of the 2011 republican primary election (Shi et al. 2012). They used tweet volume and the number of positive tweets for this task and also compared their
prediction with Real Clear Politics (RCP1) score. Ceron et al. used Tweets to analyse two elections in their paper and consider Twitter a remarkable source for the analysis of elections (Ceron et al. 2015). Also, Ahmed and Skoric analysed the first-ever Twitter campaign related to elections by Pakistan political parties (Ahmed and Skoric 2014). The study analysed the usage patterns of the different political
parties during election time. The study used the Klout score (a volumetric method) instead of sentiments to indicate the popularity of the parties to find the engagement of the parties in different dimensions. The study found that Twitter can play a significant role in a societal and political environment like Pakistan. Further, Jaidka used three approaches known as volumetric, sentiment, and social network analysis approaches to predict the general election outcome of three countries, i.e., Malaysia (2013), Pakistan (2013), and India (2014) (Jaidka et al. 2019). For India and Pakistan, the study predicted correct election outcomes, but for Malaysia, the election outcome prediction was incorrect. Unankard et al. utilized tweets about the 2013 Australian Federal election to predict the election (Unankard et al. 2014). The election prediction model they proposed is based on the sub-event score and aspect sentiment score. They compared their result with other baseline models and traditional polls and provided mean absolute error (MAE) = 4.43. MAE is the average of the differences between actual election results and the predicted result, described in detail later in Sect. 7. Further, Tsakalidis et al. Tsakalidis used Twitter data to predict the 2014 EU elections (Tsakalidis et al. 2015). Also, they considered tweets from different languages and converted them into English with the help of Google translate API. MAE score they obtained for three countries’ elections is less than 1.94. Khatua et al. also reported that by considering Tweet volume and sentiment analysis of tweets, Twitter could predict election results (Khatua et al. 2015). They predicted the election results by considering the vote share and seat share of different parties and alliances. They predicted the election result with MAE = 4.50 for vote share and MAE = 5.99 for seat share. Burnap used the SentiStrength lexicon to predict the 2015 General election UK through Tweets (Burnap et al. 2016). Tweets were collected for eleven candidates and nine parties fighting in the elections. Further, Xie collected data from Facebook, Twitter and Google for the prediction of the 2016 General election in Taiwan (Xie et al. 2018). Their study used the number of posts liked and shared from various social media platforms for election prediction. The prediction error for all three candidates was less than 5.87% in the study. Bansal and Srivastava used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Biterm Topic Model (BTM) topic modelling techniques to find the inherent topics in the Twitter data related to the 2017 state Legislative assembly election of Uttar Pradesh, India (Bansal and Srivastava 2018). Further, sentiment analysis was performed on each topic corresponding to one of the four political parties. SentiWordNet lexicon was used to find out the sentiments of each topic. In another paper, Bansal and Srivastava incorporated emojis with n-gram features of tweets to predict the vote share of the 2017 legislative election of Uttar Pradesh state in India (Bansal and Srivastava 2019). The study used seven different lexicons to find out the sentiments of tweets

and found that Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADAR) lexicon gave the least (MAE) among all other lexicons. Wang and Gan successfully predicted the 2017 French election through Twitter data with a 2% of error rate (Wang and Gan 2017). Similar to our work, Wang and Gan used the popularity of candidates for election prediction. Prabhsimran Singh used Twitter data to predict the 2018 election results in Pakistan (Singh et al. 2019). They analysed the sentiments and emotions of Twitter users related to the election. The study found that Twitter can be used as a powerful tool to predict the election outcome. Also, Budiharto and Meiliana analysed Tweets for the 2019 Presidential election in Indonesia (Budiharto and Meiliana 2018). The study used the frequency of shared and liked tweets along with their sentiment analysis. The experimental results showed possibilities for Joko Widodo to win the presidential election. Further, Awais leveraged different data sources such as polls data, surveys, social media popularity to predict the 2018 General elections of Pakistan (Awais et al. 2021). The paper introduced a novel model which used Bayesian Optimization to find out the probability of different parties to win the election for each constituency. The study predicted the seat share of political parties in the national assembly with 83% of accuracy. Anirudh Sanga used the Bayesian network approach to predict the likelihood of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's chances to re-elect as the prime minister in the General election 2019 (Sanga et al. 2020). The proposed model used various public responses from social media platforms, news articles, and the schemes that the government had launched. Besides, the study also considered other factors such as Population, occupation, age, religion, and employment. The study predicted 61.4% chances of Narendra Modi to win the 2019 general elections. Further, Amit used the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) deep learning model for the classification of Twitter users’ opinions towards the 2019 Indian General Election (Agarwal et al. 2020). The study achieved 87.30% classification accuracy with FastText word embedding method. The work also reported that Twitter could be a reliable source for election prediction in India.

Instead of election prediction, some studies contributed to the political stance detection of social media users. Stance detection is an opinion mining paradigm that determines in favour and against the judgement of authors or users towards a given target (Lai et al. 2020; Vamvas and Sennrich 2020; ALDayel and Magdy 2021). In this work, we detected the stance of Twitter users by knowing their sentiments towards predefined target keywords explained in later sections of the paper. Stance detection is an emerging field and has been used in various studies, for example, studies (Rao et al. 2010; Pennacchiotti and Popescu 2011; Al Zamal et al.
2012; Volkova et al. 2014; Preotiuc-Pietro et al. 2017; Idan and Feigenbaum 2019) have used Twitter data in detecting the political preferences of the users for the US Presidential election. Fang used tweets to get the stance of users towards the Scottish referendum using Topic-based Naïve Bayes classification (Fang et al. 2015). Further, Makazhanov tried to detect the political preferences of Twitter users towards the 2012 Albertan and 2013 Pakistan General elections using various supervised machine learning classifiers (Makazhanov et al. 2014). Also, Zubiaga used the Maximum Entropy (ME) method to get the political preferences of Twitter users over the Independence movements of Catalonia, Basque, and Scotland (Zubiaga et al. 2019).
4.4 Research gaps in “election prediction through social media”
Although the sentiment analysis field has been enhanced by various deep learning models as given in studies (Ain et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2019; Habimana et al. 2020), very little implementation of those models has been seen to discover the political preferences of people or predict elections (Chauhan et al. 2021). Only three out of thirtyeight researchers used the deep learning model in predicting election results (Chauhan et al. 2021). Further, election prediction through social media suffers from various limitations, such as the credibility of tweets, the use of social media as a black box, demographic bias, and multimodal content. Most of the studies in the literature made use of collected tweets without filtering non-credible tweets. In this work, we have removed all the retweets and duplicate tweets from the collected dataset, which may effect the final results because of a large number of the same positive or negative tweets. In addition, issues related to the credibility of tweets may arise due to sarcasm/irony, rumours, misleading information, and implicit sentiments present in the tweets (Gayo-Avello 2012a). So, it is very hard to identify such kinds of tweets and find the real meaning of those tweets. Another limitation is addressed by Panagiotis et al., who say that in most of the studies, social media has been used as a black box means it may give you correct results without knowing why (Metaxas et al. 2011). So, they suggested that there should be a proper algorithm for collecting the data, pre-processing it and interpreting the results. Given this, Algorithm 1 shows several steps that we encountered for this work. Another limitation in election prediction through social media is that users of social media are a biased sample of the voting population. We are not sure about the location, age, and gender of the users until they are verified users. Further, nowadays, on Twitter or other social media platforms, multimodal content such as images and videos are being posted at a higher rate than text, which is also yet to explore and process. In addition,


Social Network Analysis and Mining (2023) 13:88

tweets are posted in different languages, which is also a hard nut to crack. Most people prefer to tweet in their regional language, so the processing of multilingual tweets is another research challenge in election prediction. Moreover, election prediction is a time-consuming and tedious task, where a researcher has to first collect the data for a long period and then analyse it. In literature, it has been seen that researchers have simply analysed the collected data related to either candidates or their parties, but in this paper, we have collected data and analysed it by keeping four perspectives in mind i.e., candidates, parties, alliances, and trending hashtags. Some more research gaps and future directions in the research field are covered in (Gayo-avello et al. 2011; Metaxas et al. 2011; Gayo-Avello 2013; Cambria et al. 2017; Chauhan et al. 2021). However, most of the work in the literature shows successful results for election prediction using Twitter, but there is an ongoing debate in the scientific community also that Twitter should not be used for such a purpose of election prediction due to some factors (Gayoavello et al. 2011; Gayo-Avello 2012a, b). In this work, we are searching and exploring the possibility of predicting the election outcome through Twitter data. Further, Table 1 gives a brief overview of various studies related to election prediction, as given in Sect. 4.2. The table comprises eleven fields that quickly review different papers and their work in different elections. All the fields in the table are explained below.
a. Ref. paper: This field points to the paper that we are referencing. b. Election detail: This field talks about the name, year, and country of the related election. c. Data source: Provides the name of social media platform(s) from where data was collected for the prediction of election results. d. Approach: This field tells which approach was used for election prediction in the referenced paper. Various approaches used in election prediction are Sentiment analysis, Volumetric or Social network analysis, or sometimes a combination of the previous two or more. All these approaches are well explained in (Jaidka et al. 2019). e. Method: Tells which method was used under a specific approach. f. Polarity threshold: This field tells: what polarity threshold value was considered for the classification of tweets? g. Evaluation basis: This field talks about the entity for which data was collected from social media platforms and evaluation was made. Different entities are candidate names, party names, and events. h. Evaluation criteria: This field talks about the criteria considered by authors to evaluate election results. Vari
ous criteria considered by authors are seat share of candidates or parties or vote share of candidates or parties. Most of the time, single criteria were used for the evaluation of results. i. Prediction compared with: Tells, election prediction in the referenced paper was compared with pre-exit polls, opinion polls, surveys OR actual final results of that particular election. j. Performance evaluation: What metric was used to evaluate the performance of election prediction in the paper, and what was their value? k. Prediction result: This field gives the election prediction result of each paper. In this, “success” means election result predictions are the same as final results for a particular election, whereas “failure” means the election result prediction in a particular paper does not match the actual final results of that election.
5 Proposed methodology
Analysis of Twitter data for the election prediction went through various steps, which include identifying trending political hashtags, data collection, data preparation, preprocessing of data, sentiment analysis of data, and visualization. As shown in Fig. 2, the proposed methodology is divided into two folds, i.e., proposed methodology-I and proposed methodology-II. In proposed methodologyI, data is collected, prepared, pre-processed, and analysed to get sentiment values as described in Sects. 5.1–5.5. After that, in the second fold (proposed methodology-II), we set keywords related to political parties and electoral about which we wanted to detect the stance of Twitter users. Then, those tweets which contained the selected keywords and their corresponding number of positive, negative, and neutral tweets were counted and plotted as described in Sects. 5.6 and 5.7. Thus, the stance of users towards the outcome of the Lok Sabha election was detected by selecting and counting several positive tweets related to the keywords. Moreover, Algorithm 1 gives a detailed step-wise step process that has been followed in this study. The following subsection explains the role of every step followed to accomplish the proposed methodology.
5.1 Identifying trending political hashtags
In this step, most trending hashtags related to Indian politics on Twitter are identified. As shown in Fig. 2, trending hashtags were identified from two sources, the first was by using the getTrends() function of the twitteR package in R language, and the second was from the website https://trend


Social Network Analysis and Mining (2023) 13:88
13
Page 11 of 29 88
s24.in/india/. This website displays hourly trending hashtags on Twitter. From both of these sources, only trending political hashtags were chosen among the top twenty to thirty hashtags daily.
5.2 Data collection
After identifying trending political hashtags, tweets related to collected hashtags were scrapped with the help of the Twitter Representational State Transfer (REST) API using the twitteR package (Gentry 2016). Along with trending political hashtags, tweets related to political parties and the electoral were also collected using hashtags such as #BJP, #NarendraModi, #RahulGandhi, and #Congress, etc. This way, data related to trending hashtags on Twitter was collected from February 1, 2019, to May 19, 2019 (16 weeks).
Figure 3 shows a sample of the collected data from various fields. The dataset contains 5.8 million (58,97,357) tweets expressing public opinion toward electoral and their parties.
5.3 Data preparation
After collecting date-wise tweets, they were divided into 16 weeks to perform weekly analysis. In this way, we got our dataset for sixteen weeks. Appendix B gives the name of all the hashtags which were used to collect the data throughout all 16 weeks.
5.4 Data pre‐processing
After arranging data in 16 weeks, data were pre-processed in R studio using some standard library functions to remove
Fig. 2 Proposed methodology
Fig. 3 A sample of collected data


Social Network Analysis and Mining (2023) 13:88

88 Page 12 of 29
noise from the tweets. Data pre-processing is a dominant step in the sentiment analysis process that removes irregularities, noise, and inconsistency in the data (Nazir et al. 2019). The pre-processing steps used in this research work are shown in Fig. 2. The data pre-processing steps include:
5.4.1 Remove hyperlinks
We have removed hyperlinks or URLs (Uniform resource locater) from the tweets because they are not required in our analysis process.
5.4.2 Remove retweets
A retweet is a re-posting of the tweet that is shared by another user in his/her timeline. We have removed all the retweets from our dataset because a highly positive or highly negative number of retweets may effect the final results addressing a candidate’s or party’s popularity.
5.4.3 Remove replies(@)
A reply is when a user replies to someone’s tweet. All the names mentioned in replies were removed from the tweets because these are not useful in the tweet analysis.
5.4.4 Remove punctuations
Punctuation marks are symbols such as “,”, “.”, “!”, “(”, “$”, “)”, “;”, “:” etc. All these types of punctuation were removed from the collected tweets.
5.4.5 Remove extra space at the start and end of the individual tweets
Extra whitespace or tabs from starting or end of the tweets was removed for better interpretation of the tweet.
5.4.6 Remove numbers
In this step, numbers from the tweets were removed.
5.4.7 Remove duplicate tweets
All the duplicate tweets were removed from the collection of tweets to maintain the consistency of the dataset.
5.4.8 Converting all tweets into lower case letters
All the tweets were converted to lower case letters so that targeted words could be easily retrieved without any bias.
In this way, after applying all these data pre-processing steps over the collected 5.8 million (58 lacs) tweets, there left only 0.89 million (8.9 Lacs) tweets for further analysis.
5.5 Sentiment analysis of data
After pre-processing of the data, there remain unique and clean tweets. Now, every single tweet is analysed using the TextBlob library in Python (Loria Steven 2020). The TextBlob library uses the polarity and subjectivity score of a sentence to find the sentiment of that sentence. The polarity score is always between − 1 and + 1, where a polarity score of − 1 indicates an extremely negative tweet, and a polarity score of + 1 indicates a highly positive tweet. Further, the subjectivity score lies between 0 and 1, where a subjectivity score of 0 indicates zero subjectivity in the tweet, and a subjectivity score of 1, indicates a highly subjective tweet. As given in step 2 of algorithm 1, the polarity and positivity score for each tweet are found. If the polarity score and subjectivity score of every single tweet are not equal to zero and if the length of that tweet is greater than zero means a tweet has some subjective textual content inside, and then that tweet is put in an array of tweets. Then, two threshold values, 0 and ± 0.5, were taken, which interpret the collected tweets in two ways, as shown in proposed methodology-I of Fig. 2 and step 3 of algorithm 1. Further, each tweet in the array was classified into a positive, negative, and neutral category of sentiment based on one of the threshold values.
5.6 Getting the stance of users
After the sentiment classification of tweets, the target keywords were set to get users' stances towards leaders, parties, and alliances. As shown in proposed methodology-II of Fig. 2. and in step 4 of algorithm 1, fourteen (14) keywords were chosen as target keywords. The user’s stance towards these keywords was identified by counting the number of positive, negative, and neutral tweets for each term.
5.7 Result visualization
After getting polarity counts as given in the previous step, the positive number of tweets for all 16 weeks was plotted as a line graph for every comparing term using the matplotlib library of python, as shown in Figs. 4, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 13 of the next section.

6 Results anddiscussion
This section gives a detailed discussion of the empirical results of this work on the Indian general election 2019 through Twitter content. The collected data has been analysed in various dimensions to test the research hypotheses formulated in Sect. 3. Figure 4 shows the comparative analysis of positive tweets throughout the 16 weeks (prior election result) related to Narendra Modi, Rahul Gandhi, BJP, Congress, and more. There are two results for the same input as shown in all subfigures of Fig. 4 based on two threshold values, 0 and ± 0.5. These thresholds are used to classify the polarity score of each tweet into positive, negative, and neutral categories. The reason behind taking two threshold values was to see the effect on the outputs, as explained in the third paragraph of the introduction section. In the case of threshold value = 0, if the polarity score is less than 0, then the tweet is negative, and if the polarity score is greater than 0, then the tweet is positive. In the case of threshold value ± 0.5, tweets having a polarity score greater than + 0 .5 is considered positive, and tweets having polarity scores less than − 0.5 is considered negative. The effect of using two different threshold values has been seen in the popularity of the electoral and their party, as explained in further subsections.
6.1 Twitter data have the potential to predict the 2019 General Indian election results (Hypothesis 1)
Figure 4a, b, c, d and e, f reflect the 16 weeks popularity rate of leading political parties, the PM candidates Narendra Modi & Rahul Gandhi, and alliances, respectively. In addition, Fig. 5 shows the share of positive tweets about PM candidates, parties, and alliances. The results in Figs. 4 and 5 give a view of the political stance of Twitter users during election time. It clearly shows the popularity of Modi and his party over Rahul
and his party. The graphical results show that Narendra Modi and his party BJP were more popular than Rahul Gandhi and Congress during two months of election time which resembles the final election result Times of India (2019a, b). Hence, the first research hypothesis, “Twitter data have the potential to predict the 2019 General Indian election results”, is tested true. Thus, it can be interpreted that Twitter data may be considered in gauging Twitter users’ public sentiments and political stances toward national-level elections in India.
6.2 Twitter data can be analysed to show the impact of political events on the popularity of electoral or parties. (Hypothesis 2)
Various political and non-political events that happened during the election time have been considered to analyse the effect of political events on political parties and their electoral. For example, Fig. 6a shows that during the Balakot airstrike on February 26, 2019 (BBC News 2019), the popularity of the BJP as well as Narendra Modi raised high to some extent and then decreased after the fourth week (for threshold = 0). Figure 6b shows a continuous surge for Modi and BJP (for threshold 0.5). This shows the significance of using two threshold values in this paper. Also, Fig. 6a and b depict that during the 13th & 14th week, the popularity of the BJP decreased along with Narendra Modi when Modi gave a controversial statement about the Indian army in his speech at a rally (Hindu 2019a, b, c; YouTube 2019), but for the same time popularity of Rahul and Congress increased as shown in Fig. 6c and d. Further, Fig. 6a shows that with the release of the BJP manifesto during the election time, Modi’s popularity increased to some extent while the popularity of the BJP’s started decreasing (for threshold=0). Figure 6b shows a decline in popularity of both BJP and Modi (for threshold = ± 0.5). In opposite of this, with the release of the Congress manifesto, Fig. 6c shows a decrease in the popularity of Rahul Gandhi but an increase in the popularity of the party, while Fig. 6d shows a decrease in both of them. Although there is very less effect of taking two threshold values, Twitter results might be able to reflect the impact of such events on the popularity of electoral or party. So, our hypothesis, “Twitter data can be analysed to show the impact of political events on the popularity of electoral or party”, is true.
6.3 There will be a direct relationship between the popularity of the electoral and his party (Hypothesis 3)
If we have a look at Fig. 7a and b, we can relate the popularity of Modi and his party BJP. In the figure, it can be seen that for every single surge of the BJP party, there is also a surge in the popularity of Modi. Further, this is the same in

the case of Rahul Gandhi and Congress from Fig. 7c and d. For example, a surge in popularity can be seen during the 3rd week of the election period in the case of Modi and his party BJP. Moreover, surges can also be seen during the 5th, 8th, and 11th weeks. In addition, we calculated correlations to find an association between the popularity of leaders and their parties using the positive number of tweets throughout the 16 weeks. From Fig. 8 and Table 2, we saw a positive correlation between leaders and their parties. We are also able to interpret that there is a strong relationship between Narendra Modi and BJP as compared to Rahul Gandhi and Congress, as given in Table 2. Therefore, we can say that there is a direct relationship between the popularity of the electoral and his party. Hence, the third hypothesis, “There will be a direct relationship between the popularity of the electoral and his party”, is also true.
6.4 The main two parties (BJP and INC) and PM candidates will reply more to the general public (Hypothesis 4)
Figure 9 depict the official Twitter accounts of the two main leader and their parties and shows the number of replies made by them to other Twitter users. To interpret this result, we utilized ReplyToSN (Reply to screen name) attribute in the collected data. We can see that any electoral or political party have replied to a very small number of users. The result of this figure also reveals that BJP and Congress mostly replied within party accounts and they didn’t reply to any opposite party or leader. Moreover, there is only one reply to a user from Modi's Twitter account, while in the case of Rahul, there are only two replies to the same user. So, based on our dataset, there was very little interaction in

Social Network Analysis and Mining (2023) 13:88

Page 17 of 29 88
terms of replies from the side of parties and leaders to other users, as we can see in Fig. 9. Therefore, our hypothesis “The main two parties (BJP and INC) and PM candidates will reply more to the general public” is False here, and from this, we can interpret that the main two parties and leaders did not reply to common users and not make any direct interaction with them.
6.5 Mostly negative views and posts will be shared among people. (Hypothesis 5)
The collected data give the views and thoughts of the public towards the political parties and the electoral through tweets. Sometimes, people get influenced by the tweets that are shared by the people they follow. Figures 10 and 11 depict which type of tweets were retweeted frequently, i.e., whether positive, negative, or neutral tweets were shared most of the time by Twitter users about a particular party
or its leader. The number of positive, negative, and neutral tweets retweeted were calculated as F1, F2, and F3, respec
tively as given in Eqs. 1, 2, and 3.
Here, F1, F2, F3 = No. of times positive, negative, and
neutral tweets retweeted about any electoral or his party. Pr = Number of positive retweets
Pt = Total positive tweets

F1 = Pr

Nr = Number of negative retweets
Nt = Total negative tweets
Nur = Number of neutral retweets
Nut = Total neutral tweets
The result in Fig. 10 shows that in the case of party-wise retweet count, positive, negative, and neutral tweets about the congress party were shared a greater number of times than the BJP. For example, negative tweets about Congress have been retweeted 509 times, whereas negative tweets
about BJP have been retweeted 77 times. Also, in the case of leader-wise retweet count, as shown in Fig. 11, positive, negative, and neutral tweets about Modi were shared a greater number of times than Rahul Gandhi. For example, negative tweets about Modi have been retweeted 49 times, whereas negative tweets about Rahul Gandhi have been retweeted 31 times. This result reveals that in the case of political parties’ negativity was shared more about Congress than BJP, whereas in the case of leaders, more negativity was shared about Modi than Rahul Gandhi. Also, from Figs. 10 and 11, negative retweet counts in both party-wise and leader-wise cases are more than positive and neutral counts. Therefore, our hypothesis, “Mostly negative views, posts will be shared among people”, is again true. Negativity is shared the maximum time on social media.

6.6 Analysing Twitter campaigns run by various parties will be helpful in predicting election results. (Hypothesis 6)
During election time, various campaigns were run by political parties to promote their party using various hashtags. Tweets under these hashtags are grouped into two categories which correspond to BJP and Congress parties. So, 11 weeks’ analysis of these campaigns is depicted in Fig. 12, which shows more popularity of campaigns run by the BJP than the campaigns run by Congress. Further, Fig. 13 depicts the popularity of the two most used hashtags,
#NamoAgain2019 (Narendra Modi again in 2019) and #NoMo (No Modi), used by the BJP and Congress parties, respectively. All the resulting figures in this section indicate that BJP and Modi had higher popularity as compared to the competing party. Thus, our hypothesis, “Analysing Twitter campaigns run by various parties will be helpful in predicting election results”, is true, and we can interpret the stance of Twitter users in various campaigns was indicating that the Modi-led BJP party had more chances to win the 2019 Indian Lok Sabha election. Also, the results of this empirical study resemble the actual results of the final election (Times of India 2019a, b).
6.7 Taking two threshold values for sentiment classification of collected tweets will affect the positivity or popularity rate of leaders and parties. (Hypothesis 7)
Although analysing tweets with a threshold value of ± 0.5 will change the number of positive and negative tweets because a third class, i.e., a neutral class having polarity between − 0.5 and + 0.5, will be introduced. But, we wanted to see its effect on the overall positive rate of the two comparing entities. Will it be the same as both of the entities having classification threshold 0, or will it change? We have seen that in most visualization results (Figs. 4, 6 and 7), the classification results of positive tweets are slightly different for the threshold values 0 and ± 0.5. However, there is not much effect on the overall positive rate of a variable. Still, some contradictions can be seen while analysing data points on specific duration, as some cases have been discussed in Sect. 6.2 of this paper. Thus, our hypothesis, “Taking two threshold values for sentiment classification of collected

tweets will affect the positivity or popularity rate of leaders and parties”, is partially true here. It is true when we analyse overall popularity results for the different entities or variables and false when analysing popularity results for a particular week. Since all the visualization results where the 0 threshold value has been considered have shown a more prominent positive rate for various political events, therefore we chose to consider the 0 threshold value for further use in Sects. 7.

7 Evaluation of the results and major findings
This section evaluates the predicted election result in terms of the popularity of electoral, alliances, and competing parties. However, Figs. 4, 5, 12, and 13 show a clear win of the Modi lead BJP Government in the election based on the popularity of different variables when compared with Congress. Still, a metric is needed that signifies the dominance of this study. In the previous studies, as shown in Table 1, most of the studies have used different metrics such as MAE, RMSE (Root mean square error), MSE (Mean square error),

error percentage etc., for the prediction of election results. The authors have employed only MAE as the evaluation metric for election prediction because the results obtained in Tables 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, and 12 depict a uniform distribution of errors. Thus, MAE and RMSE show the same values. Also, MSE is employed when a larger value of errors is desirable, which is not required in our case. In addition, MAPE gives percentage error, which may not be useful to use in election prediction tasks. Moreover, MAE is the most widely used metric for election prediction, as shown in previous studies (Table 1), and therefore we used MAE for the evaluation of the work. MAE is the average of the differences between actual election results and the predicted result for the various political parties and the electoral. The MAE is calculated using the formulae given in Eq. 4.
Here. MAE = Mean Absolute Erroryi = predicted valuexi = actual value n = the number of observations
7.1 Candidate‐wise prediction using vote share
Figure 4 depicts the share of positive tweets related to two main competing PM candidates, Modi and Rahul, in the collected dataset. From the figure, it is clear that during the two months of the election period on Twitter, Modi got more popularity than Rahul. In addition, Table 3 shows the MAE score calculated for candidate-wise prediction using vote share. In Table 3, actual vote counts for the two PM candidates have been taken from the official website of the Election Commission of India (ECI 2019b), and the positive proportion of tweets is calculated as given in Eq. 5 below.

MAE =

Here.
X = Proportion of positive tweet shares for the candidate
7.2 Party‐wise and alliance‐wise prediction using vote share and seat share
Tables 4 and 5 show party-wise and alliance-wise seat and vote share in the year 2019 (Ramani 2019; Sharma 2019a). The MAE is calculated for both seat share and vote share of alliances and parties to find the correctness of our results, as given in Tables 6, 7, 8, and 9. Figure 14 compares MAE calculated for party-wise and alliance-wise vote share and seat share, respectively. MAE calculated by party-wise vote share and alliance-wise vote share shows the correctness of our results related to the 2019 Indian general election. We have also compared our results with exit poll results conducted by various news agencies and channels, as shown in Table 11 and Table 12(b). Figure 15 shows the comparison of MAE between our result and news channel results, and this figure also shows the proximity between our and the results of their pre-exit polls. Since we didn’t gather and analyse tweets of parties other than the two major political parties, BJP and Congress, we do not consider any other party’s actual vote share or seat share. Hence normalized seat shares of BJP, INC, NDA, and UPA in Tables 6 and 8 is calculated as given in Eqs. (6), (7), (8), and (9), respectively.
(5)
X = CP
CP + CN
× 100
CP = No.of Positive tweets about the candidate
CN = No.of Negative tweets about the candidate
(6)
Normalized seat share for BJP = Seatshare of BJP
Seat share of BJP + Seat share of INC × 100
(7)
Normalized seat share for INC = Seat share of INC
Seat share of BJP + Seat share of INC × 100
(8)
Normalized seat share for NDA = Seat share of NDA
Seat share of NDA + Seat share of UPA × 100
(9)
Normalized seat share for UPA = Seat share of UPA
Seatshare of NDA + Seat share of UPA × 100

Similarly, we normalized vote share, and the values are given in Tables 7 and 9. Results from Tables 7, 8 and Fig. 14 show that MAE calculated from party-wise vote share and alliance-wise seat share are very less, while in other cases, the MAE score is relatively high. Therefore, party-wise vote share and alliance-wise seat share results may be able to predict the election result. Further, Tables 10 and 12a show pre-exit poll results from various news agencies related to the seat share of two major alliances, NDA & UPA and major parties, BJP & INC (The Hindu 2019a). Again, since we are only analysing tweets related to only two parties and alliances, therefore seat share of other parties and alliances are ignored. The seat shares of various news channels in Tables 10 and 12a is normalized as given in Eq. (10).
Here. Y = Normalized seat share predicted by any news agency M = Number of seats predicted for one party or alliance by a news channel
(10)
Y= M
M + N × 100
N = Number of seats predicted for another party or alliance by a news channel For example, the exit poll results of Times Now predicted that NDA will get 306 seats and UPA will get 132 seats.
Therefore, Normalized seat share predicted by Times Now
for NDA(Y1) = 306
306 + 132 = 69.86(in %)
Table 11 and Fig. 15 show that MAE calculated for our result is the second number after the News 18 channel. This shows that our method for predicting which alliance will lead in the Indian Lok Sabha election in 2019 is near to the actual results and also shows the correctness of the empirical study. Further, in the case of party-wise seat share, the MAE score is quite high but shows a competing result to IANS, CVOTER, and ABP-Neilsen, as given in Table 12b and shown in Fig. 16. Below, we pointed out the major findings of this research work summarized in Sects. 6 and 7.
• Twitter data may be considered in predicting and gauging the political stance of Twitter users toward nationallevel elections in India (Many pieces of evidence are in Sects. 6 and 7).

• Twitter results might be able to reflect the impact of political events on the popularity of electoral or parties (discussed in Sect. 6.2). • There is a direct relationship between the popularity of the electoral and his party (discussed in Sect. 6.3). • There was very little interaction from the side of parties or leaders towards the common Twitter users (discussed in Sect. 6.4). • The work reveals that during the election, negativity was shared more among users about candidates and their parties as compared to positivity (discussed in Sect. 6.5). • Twitter campaigns run by BJP gained more popularity than the campaigns run by Congress (discussed in Sect. 6.6). • Although the overall output results displayed almost the same positive rate for both of the threshold values but taking two different threshold values directly affects the positive rate or popularity of different entities when observed for a specific time (discussed in Sects. 6.2 and 6.7). • In this study, observing less MAE scores for candidatewise, party-wise vote share, and alliance-wise seat share results gave the possibility to predict the election result correctly (discussed in Sect. 7). • In the case of party-wise seat share and alliance-wise vote share, the MAE score is quite high but almost similar to other news channels.
8 Conclusion and future work
In this paper, a dataset is prepared by collecting tweets for gauging the stance of the public towards the Indian Lok Sabha election 2019 and predicting its result. In this paper, we prepared research hypotheses that reflect various research questions about Twitter and its use in
election prediction. All the hypotheses are tested using positive sentiment visualization of users towards different entities/variables throughout the election period. In this paper, a lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach has been used to gauge the mood of the public through the collected Twitter data. The results of this empirical study clearly show the popularity of Modi and his party before and during the election time. So, based on the popularity of leaders, parties, and alliances over Twitter, this case study indicates the possibility that the Modi government was more likely to win the 2019 Lok Sabha election as compared to Congress. We have also compared our prediction results with pre-exit poll results from various news channels and the final results. The lower values of the MAE score (< 18.61) indicate the significance of our work. A limitation in the field of election prediction through sentiment analysis of social media is the unavailability of the example dataset for a particular election based on which a machine learning or deep learning-based classifier can be built. Hence, we lacked to implement such a classifier and limited our work by using a lexicon-based approach only. Another limitation we encountered in this field is less work on political multimodal sentiment analysis of social media content. We also use only textual data to analyse the sentiments of the users, while images may also play an important role in the more accurate classification of the tweets. Also, multilingual, sarcasm and target independence in the tweets make it hard to interpret their correct sentiment values. So, future work is needed to focus on finding solutions to all these problems and improve the accuracy of election prediction and sentiment classification also.
