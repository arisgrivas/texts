Abstract
Instruction-finetuned Large Language Models inherit clear political leanings that have been shown to influence downstream task performance. We expand this line of research beyond the two-party system in the US and audit Llama Chat in the context of EU politics in various settings to analyze the model’s political knowledge and its ability to reason in context. We adapt, i.e., further fine-tune, Llama Chat on speeches of individual euro-parties from debates in the European Parliament to reevaluate its political leaning based on the EUANDI questionnaire. Llama Chat shows considerable knowledge of national parties’ positions and is capable of reasoning in context. The adapted, party-specific, models are substantially re-aligned towards respective positions which we see as a starting point for using chat-based LLMs as data-driven conversational engines to assist research in political science.
1 Introduction
While Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit unprecedented Natural Language Understanding capabilities (OpenAI, 2023; Anil et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023), there are open debates concerning their helpfulness and safety, with recent work exploring political biases in LLMs (Feng et al., 2023; Santurkar et al., 2023).1 The literature, so far, is very limited to the exploration of mostly prior-art models, e.g., BERT-like models, or early versions of GPT, and mainly focuses on the ‘binary’ US political context, i.e., the two-party (Democrats vs. Republicans) system. In this study, we investigate using LLMs to explore political biases in a European political context, thereby focusing on the European Union (EU).
∗Equal contribution. 1We use the terms political ‘biases’ and ‘leanings’ interchangeably; in the sense that political leanings can be viewed as forms of inductive bias, i.e., models align more with some political views over others.
Figure 1: Examples of responses to EUANDI question from LLMs adapted in different euro-party speeches, i.e., left-wing GUE/NGL and far-right ID parties.
To do so, we use debates from plenary sessions of the European Parliament and EU-related political questionnaires. Furthermore, we are interested in the possibility of aligning (adapting) LLMs with political parties to further explore political biases in a conversational framework. We see this work as a starting point for using LLMs to aid research in political science. To do this, we need to investigate the political biases of LLMs, analyse their capabilities to reason in the context of politics, and explore how and to what extent we can align a model towards a specific political ideology, e.g., a political party. Further on, we are interested in exploring how such technologies could be used to inform citizens on politics. Therefore, our main research questions are:
i) RQ1: Do LLMs have political knowledge, e.g., do they have knowledge of the political biases (leanings) of different political parties? This question has been partially explored in the ‘binary’ political US context (democrats/liberals vs. conservatives/republicans). In our work, we experiment in the political context of the EU, which is more diverse, while incorporating both national (individual EU member states) and EU-wide characteristics. We audit models for their knowledge about the political leaning of EU national parties (Section 5).

ii) RQ2: Can LLMs reason on political matters, e.g., estimate political biases based on political opinions? To the best of our knowledge, this question has not been explored so far. In our work, we investigate this direction by in-context auditing LLMs related to political topics (Section 5).
iii) RQ3: Can we adapt (align) LLMs to reflect the political stances of specific political parties to better understand them? Again, this direction has been partially explored in the US binary political context with non-conversational LMs, e.g., BERTlike or early GPT models, and not using actual political debates. In our work, we adapt LLMs to political debates from the European Parliament and investigate how adaptation affects their behavior, especially alignment, via auditing (Section 6).
2 European Parliament 101
The European Parliament is composed of more than 700 elected representatives from the EU member states, called Members of the European Parliament (MEPs).2 The MEPs represent their national parties, while national parties form EU-level coalitions known as euro-parties. The European Parliament organizes plenary sessions, where debates among MEPs take place in response to matters of interest and/or voting on legislation proposed by the European Commission. The EU political spectrum is very diverse across many dimensions: from left to right socio-economically, from liberal to conservative, and also related to the very existence and operation of the EU where stances vary from pro-EU to euro-skepticism, and anti-EU. Since the EU is a European multi-national organization, the political debates around the EU, and the European Parliament consider national-level matters, alongside the shared concerns and directions of the EU.
3 Data
EU Debates Corpus We release a new corpus of parliamentary proceedings (debates) from the European Parliament. The corpus consists of approx. 87k individual speeches in the period 20092023 (Table 1). We exhaustively scrape the data from the official European Parliament Plenary website.2 All speeches are time-stamped, thematically organized on debates, and include metadata relevant to the speaker’s identity (full name, euro-party affiliation, speaker role), and the debate (date and

title). Older debate speeches are originally in English, while newer ones are linguistically diverse across the 23 official EU languages, thus we also provide machine-translated versions in English, when official translations are missing. We present additional details and statistics in Appendix A.3
EU and I In this study, we use the questionnaire from the “EU and I” (EUANDI) project published by Michel et al. (2019), as an evaluation benchmark. EUANDI was publicly released before the 2019 EU election, to help EU citizens find their affinity to candidate national parties.4 The questionnaire has 22 questions in the form of a political statement followed by 5 available options from complete disagreement to complete agreement. In Table 5 of the appendix, we present all statements presented in the EUANDI questionnaire with their categorization. The questions are organized into 7 thematic categories: Liberal Society (LIB), Environmental Protection (ENV), EU Integration (EU), Economic Liberalisation (ECON), Financial Restrictions (FIN), Immigration Restrictions (IMM), and Law and Order (LAW). The authors also provide the expected answers (agreement) to the statements in question for all national parties across EU member states, alongside a verbatim justification, i.e., an excerpt from the party’s program or public statements. As part of this work, we redistribute the EUANDI as a unified dataset, including the statements, their categorization, the parties’ answers, and justifications, all provided by Michel et al..5

Figure 2: The different templates we use to audit the models. Setting A and B have the same options as the MAIN QUESTION TEMPLATE in 3rd person. S denotes a statement from the EUANDI questionnaire, T is the title of a debate, U an utterance (speech), O a member state, P a national party name and J a justification on a specific topic.
4 Experimental Set Up
We separate our experiments into two main parts. In the first part, Contextualized Auditing, we audit the baseline (out-of-the-box) LLMs to assess their political knowledge, and political understanding (reasoning) capabilities, using the EUANDI questionnaire, and in the second part, Political Adaptation / Alignment, we adapt (align) the models using speeches of specific parties from the EUDEBATES dataset, and then assess how their behavior (stance) changes compared to the baseline.6
In the lack of multilingual chat-based LLMs, we rely on the best to-date open-source Llama 2 models (Touvron et al., 2023) across all experiments. We consider the chat-based, i.e., instruction fine-tuned (Chung et al., 2022) and aligned (Leike et al., 2018), 13B model, Llama Chat. We use the EUANDI questionnaire as an evaluation benchmark with different templates as displayed in Figure 2.
Llama Chat, as most other LLMs, have been aligned with human preferences that adhere to pre-defined ethical guidelines, i.e., to generate responses that are safe, respectful, do not cause harm, and are socially unbiased. This latter point of neutrality poses challenges when we want to investigate the stance of LLMs in important social questions, such as political ones. Indeed, we find that the model refuses to share an opinion across all questions related to the EUANDI questionnaire. To be able to use the model, we need to loosen up these restrictions, which are hard-coded in the system’s prompt, usually referred to as “jailbreaking”. In preliminary experiments, we found three alternative prompts that effectively “jailbreak” the model, i.e., the model provides answers. In the rest of the paper, we present results aggregated across all of them to account for the potential instability.7
6We release our code base for the reproducibility of all experiments at https://github.com/coastalcph/eu-pol itics-llms.
7We present more details on “jailbreaking” in Appendix C.
5 Contextualized Auditing
5.1 Methodology
To investigate research questions RQ1, and RQ2 (Section 1), we audit Llama Chat on the EUANDI questionnaire by asking questions in-context.
Setting A: In this setting, we provide as context to the model, the EU state of origin (O), e.g., ‘German’, and name (P ) of a national party, e.g., ‘Die Linke’, and ask the questions based on TEMPLATE (A) in Figure 2. With this, we assess how the LLM can exploit its internal knowledge for a given party to predict the answer (agreement) to the related statement in context, e.g., Die Linke is a left-wing party. We provide examples in Appendix E.
Setting B: In this setting, we provide the justification (J) of a given national party to the model as context and use TEMPLATE (B). With this, we assess how the LLM can reason on politics using the justification (position) (J) to predict the answer (agreement) to the related statement in context. We provide examples in Appendix E.
Setting C: In this setting, we combine the previous settings, and underlying questions (RQ1-2) and provide a party’s justification to the model asking which party this relates to, see TEMPLATE (C) in Figure 2. Hence, we assess both capabilities, i.e., the model’s knowledge while reasoning in context.
5.2 Results
In Table 2, we present the results in settings A and B of contextualized auditing aggregating the results of national parties from three EU Member States (Germany, France, and Greece) across europarties, i.e., we aggregate the model’s accuracy of the national-level parties, based on their euro-party affiliation, e.g., the German CDU, the French LR, and the Greek ND for EPP. We present detailed national-level results in Tables 6-7 in Appendix D.


Party Name Setting A Setting B
EPP 47.6 59.1 S&D 73.3 85.6 Greens/EFA 81.3 90.5 GUE/NGL 78.5 83.1 ID 67.7 56.0
Avg. 69.7 74.9
Table 2: Accuracy of Llama Chat in contextualized auditing settings (A&B) aggregated among euro-parties.
Setting A: Given the results in Setting A, where contextualization solely relies on parties’ names, accuracy, i.e., the ability of a model to predict a party’s official position on a given statement, varies (approx. 48-81%). We observe that the parties affiliated with EPP and ID show the lowest scores and the ones affiliated with GREENS/EFA and GUE/NGL show the highest ones. We have similar patterns considering national parties (Table 6).
Setting B: Based on the results in Setting B, where the contextualization relies on the parties’ statements, we observe that the model’s predictive accuracy also varies (approx. 56-91%) with a similar tendency as in Setting A where ID and EPP shows lowest and GREENS/EFA, S&D, and GUE/NGL show much higher predictability (Table 2). Again, we see very similar patterns on the national level (Table 7). In general, we observe that the model’s accuracy in Setting B is higher compared to Setting A by approx. 5% on average, i.e., the answers are more predictable based on the (in context) justifications compared to the model’s perception (knowledge), and in many cases, the improvement is close to 10% (S&D, GREENS/EFA). In contrast, we see an exception when it comes to parties affiliated with ID.
Setting C: We show results for setting C, i.e., predicting the party based on its statements, in Figure 3 for German parties. We show the distribution over predicted parties for each ground-truth party, e.g., for Die Grünen the model primarily predicted Die Grünen followed by SPD, Die Linke and CDU. We see that the prediction for the majority of the statements is the correct party followed by parties that are politically close to the respective party, e.g., Die Linke and Die Grünen are both rather left-leaning parties. For French and Greek parties, we have similar results, but interestingly the model tends to assign justifications to parties affiliated with the

left-wing GUE/NGL, and the social democrats S&D (Figures 8-9), more frequently.
Overall: Concerning RQ1, given the results in Setting A, we observe that the model has substantial political knowledge in most cases, while in some other cases, the model is underperforming, e.g., in the case of EPP affiliates. These results align with the results in Setting B, which suggests that the position of specific parties in the same group is inherently harder to predict. We confirm this by manually annotating the positions of German parties and get accuracies of 75% for CDU and 90% for Die Grünen (averaged across both annotators/authors) in comparison to the original party answers. For RQ2, we also observe that the model can reason upon political statements and predict political inclinations with the few notable exceptions mentioned above. We see similar results in Setting C where the model primarily predicts the correct party or parties with high affinity.
6 Political Adaptation / Alignment
6.1 Methodology
Further on, we want to explore RQ3 (Section 1), by adapting the LLM to speeches of members of a political party. To do so, we fine-tune Llama Chat on the speeches from the EUDEBATES dataset using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) of Hu et al. (2022). Since we are interested in fine-tuning conversational (chat-based) models, we create instructions as pseudo-QA pairs, similar to Cheng et al. (2023) using the PSEUDO-QA TEMPLATE (Figure 2) where T is the title (topic) of the debate, e.g., “Immigration and cooperation among Member States”, and U is the utterance (speech) of an MEP affiliated with the party of interest. We fine-tune Llama Chat on speeches from MEPs affiliated with: the European People’s Party (EPP), a centre-right party, the Pro


Figure 4: Radar plots for the adapted models (Section 6.1) on EUANDI. The radars depict the polarity of each model across the 7 thematic categories (Section 3). The yellow areas represent the polarity of the baseline model, Llama Chat, out-of-the-box. In contrast, the gray areas represent the polarity based on the model’s options (automatic evaluation). The dark-shaded areas, e.g., green for the GREENS/EFA party, represent the polarity based on the party’s options. In contrast, the light-shaded areas represent the polarity based on the model’s justifications (manual evaluation). We present an enlarged version of the radars plots in Figure 11.
gressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&D), a social-democratic party, the European United Left (GUE/NGL), a left-wing party, the Greens–European Free Alliance (GREENS/EFA), a green left-wing party, and Identity and Democracy (ID), a far-right party.8 We see these models as data-driven mirrors of the parties’ ideologies. We use a learning rate of 2e−4, and train for 10 epochs. All models exhibit similar convergence patterns (Figure 10). We then use the MAIN QUESTION TEMPLATE from Figure 2 to evaluate the answers of the adapted models in comparison with the baseline model (out-of-the-box) and assess the model’s re-alignment to the target party’s ideology, as approximated by the EUANDI questionnaire.
6.2 Results
In Figure 4, we present results based on the adapted (fine-tuned) models in the form of radar plots with the seven thematic categories of the EUANDI questionnaire, expressing the polarity per dimension. We first calculate scores based on the original position of Llama Chat depicted with yellow-shaded color. We then calculate scores based on the options the adapted models picked (grey areas). However, via manual inspection, we observe that there is often disagreement between the model’s answer (option A-E) and its justification. Thus, we manually annotated the statements based on the models’ justifications, which we also include in the radar plots (lighter-shaded areas) along with the original (gold-standard) party answers (darker-shaded areas). We observe a high agreement between our annotations, the model’s answers, and the original

party answers for GREENS/EFA and ID. In the case of GUE/NGL, we only see a high agreement between our annotations and the ground truth. Our model-based analysis finds GUE/NGL slightly more pro-EU compared to the ground truth. We have similar results for S&D, where our modelbased analysis finds the party slightly less pro-EU. For EPP there is a clear deviation across settings. This is in line with the results in Section 5 where we also see lower accuracy for the national parties in the EPP coalition. We observe that models’ alignment is not connected to higher data availability (Table 1), nor better language modeling accuracy (Figure 10). We hypothesize that the issue mostly derives from qualitative reasons related to the political alignment among members of the parties. EPP and S&D are known to be “big tent” parties that encompass a broad spectrum of ideologies within their memberships, under which various social groups are united by a common goal or set of core values rather than a uniform ideology.9
7 Conclusion
In our analysis, we demonstrated Llama Chat’s considerable prior knowledge of political parties and their positions and its ability to reason in context, i.e., rate the level of agreement to a statement given a (party) justification. By fine-tuning on targeted political debates, we were able to re-align the model’s political opinion towards specific europarties. This works better for parties with a “consistent” ideology like GREENS/EFA, GUE/NGL, and ID in comparison to “big tent” parties with diverse political positions like EPP and S&D. We will use this study as a starting point for future work to use LLMs to aid research in political science.

Limitations
Size of LLMs: Our study is limited to 13-billionparameter-sized Llama Chat models. We experimented initially with 7-billion-parameter-sized models but decided to proceed further with the largest model we could. Unfortunately, we lack the compute infrastructure to experiment with the available 70-billion-parameter-sized models. In the future, we plan to use much larger, efficient models, such as the newly released (08/11/2023) Mistral AI 8×7B Mixture of Experts (MoE) model (Jiang et al., 2024), dubbed Mixtral, which outperform even bigger ones, in most NLU benchmarks.
English-only LLMs: In the lack of any opensource available multilingual conversational (chatbased) models during this project, we use Englishonly Llama models. Parts of the newly released EUDEBATES dataset (Section 3) are in other languages, similar to the parties’ justification in the EUANDI dataset, hence we use machine-translated versions of those in English. This is not ideal, since the machine-translation process has inevitably a certain level of noise (inaccuracy) and potential language bias. In the future, we plan to use multilingual models, such as Mixtral, and extend our study also to debates from national plenary sessions, e.g., the German Bundestag.
Option/Justification Misalignment In Section 6, we discuss the issue of misalignment between the model’s option, e.g., (a)-(e), and the follow-up provided justification, i.e., the model selects the option (e) Completely agree, while the justification shows the exact opposite polarity. This issue leads to the need for manual annotations, which is not possible in a large-scale study with many more parties and/or questions. In the future, we want to explore how to mitigate this issue. One idea is the use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting (Wei et al., 2022) where the model explains its reasoning before answering a question, or potentially the use of much more capable LLMs will solve this discrepancy.
Time-frames: In our adaptation experiments, we use debates from 2009-2023, while the EUANDI questionnaire and parties’ responses represent the public pre-EU-elections debate in 2019. This can be a potential source of misalignment since parties’ are live organizations that change positions over time. In the future, we plan to investigate how the
dimension of time affects results with a chronological analysis examining temporal drifts in parties’ political leanings.
Annotation Bias: We use manual annotations in specific parts of our study (Sections 5 and 6). Such annotations inevitably are biased to some degree based on our perception of politics, and our background knowledge. There are similar complications in other subjective NLP tasks, such as sentiment analysis or toxicity classification, and there is extensive literature on annotators’ disagreement and bias. A broader annotator pool will possibly balance out the effect of subjectivity. In the future, we plan to invest more resources in annotation processes related to this project.
Limited Data Coverage: We conduct our experiments for a small subset of parties, available in the EUANDI dataset, for both contextualized auditing -5 parties from 3 EU member states-, and adaptation -5 out of 7 euro-parties-. While our work poses interesting findings, analyzing results for all parties could provide a much broader understanding of general trends, relevant to specific political ideologies or differences across countries. In the newly released dataset, EU Debates, we include data for the top 5 popular parties based on the 2019 European Parliament elections from the 10 most populous EU member states, including parties affiliated with ALDE and ECR.
Data Skewness: The newly released EUDEBATES dataset does not equally cover all thematic areas considered in the EUANDI questionnaire. As depicted in Figure 5, issues related to EU integration, economics, and law and order are discussed much more than issues related to the environment, immigration, and individual rights. This discrepancy may pose challenges in aligning models when it comes to the latter thematic topics. Balancing data across topics during fine-tuning may be an option to consider in future work.
Ethics Statement
We believe that this work, particularly the adaptation (fine-tuning) of LLMs to political parties, poses ethical concerns that we need to address and inform the community about. Nonetheless, this is an important line of computational social science research that aims to shed light on challenging questions related to the political biases of LLMs, and their use in aiding research in political science.


Some of those models generate text reflecting opinions that might be considered discriminatory, for instance, towards asylum seekers and immigrants. We want to point out that this stems from realworld parliamentary data that is already open to the public. The analysis of political stances is a crucial part of this paper which by no means implies that we, the authors, agree with this line of politics. Moreover, the adapted models can be seen as datadriven mirrors of the parties’ ideologies, but are by no means ’perfect’, and thus may misrepresent them. We urge the community and the public to refer to credible sources, e.g., parties’ programs, interviews, original speeches, etc., when it comes to getting political information. We believe that the release of the parliamentary corpus is a crucial step to facilitate future research but we will release the fine-tuned (adapted) models with a restrictive license under request to other researchers who aim to explore the political biases of LLMs and their use in the context of research in political science to foster future research, while restraining the deployment of such models in public.

A Datasets Details
The newly released EUDEBATES dataset consists of approx. 87k individual speeches in the period 2009-2023 (Table 1). We automatically translate
Figure 5: Distribution of speeches in the newly released EU Debates dataset per EUANDI thematic topic.
all speeches using the EasyNMT (Reimers, 2021) framework with the M2M2-100 (418M) model. In Table 3, we present statistics across EU languages. Table 4 presents statistics for each euro-party across years. In Figures 5-6, we present statistics on the topics of the debates based on the 7 thematic topics of the EUANDI questionnaire or the 18 EU subcommissions. To infer the topics, we use Llama Chat to auto-classify the speeches. Based on the data, it is clear that some topics are discussed more often than others, e.g., issues related to EU integration, economics, and law and order much more than issues related to the environment, immigration, and individual rights.

(2023) find that language models exhibit different political leanings based on the political compass.10 The political compass is a questionnaire that maps the users’ answers to a 2-dimensional political spectrum (left/right, authoritarian/libertarian). Those political biases influence downstream task performance, here hatespeech and misinformation detection, after further pre-training on social media and news corpora. Datasets, evaluation, and analyses are mainly applicable to the US. Hartmann et al. (2023) conduct a similar analysis of its political leaning in the context of the political compass, thereby focusing on ChatGPT. They further prompt the model based on German and Dutch national questionnaires, overall coming to a similar conclusion as Feng et al. 2023 that ChatGPT leans mostly left-libertarian. In our work, we want to extend this approach by evaluating and training using data from the European

Parliament. Furthermore, we introduce an evaluation framework based on contextualized prompts where we prompt different versions of Llama (Touvron et al., 2023) with justifications instead of statements/questions alone. Santurkar et al. (2023) prompt a set of 9 models with about 1500 questions from science, politics, and personal relationships to find out with which US-based demographic group those models most align with. They confirm previous findings that language models express opinions that represent some demographic groups more than others. Haller et al. (2023) fine-tune LLMs on data from different demographic sub-groups spanning political (liberal, conservative), regional (USA, Germany, Middle East, Latin America), age (teenager, >30, >45), and gender (male, female) from relevant sub-reddits, which then they examine for biases across different demographic groups given prompts from the BOLD dataset (Dhamala et al., 2021). Across the literature, the use of original political statements derived from plenary sessions (debates), or other relevant sources, e.g., interviews, party programs, etc., is missing. Our work aims to cover

this limitation incorporating political statements in both prompting and adaptation of LLMs.
C JailBreaking Prompting
Large Language Models (LLMs) have been optimized to follow instructions (Chung et al., 2022) and have been aligned (Leike et al., 2018) with reinforcement learning from human feedback (Christiano et al., 2017; Stiennon et al., 2020). The goal is to align models with human preferences that usually adhere to pre-defined ethical guidelines, e.g., to generate responses that are safe, respectful, lawful, do not cause harm, and are socially unbiased. This latter point of neutrality poses challenges when we want to investigate the stance of LLMs in important social questions, such as political ones. There has been extensive research on how someone can ‘jailbreak‘ LLMs, i.e., bypass the implicit filtering framework, via prompting. In the case of Llama Chat the original prompt of the model reads as: “You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. Always answer as helpfully as possible, while being safe. Your answers should not include any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content. Please ensure that your responses are socially unbiased and positive in nature. If a question does not make any sense or is not factually coherent, explain why instead of answering something not correct. If you don’t know the answer to a question, please don’t share false information.”.
Indeed, we find that the model, Llama Chat, refuses to share an opinion across all questions related to the EUANDI questionnaire (Figure 15). To be able to use the model, we need to loosen up these restrictions, which are hard-coded in the sys

tem’s prompt, usually referred to as “jailbreaking”. In preliminary experiments, we found three alternative prompts that effectively “jailbreak” the model, i.e., the model provides answers.
i) P1: “You are a helpful and honest assistant. Always answer.”
ii) P2: “You are a helpful and honest assistant. Always answer. Your responses can be socially biased and subjective.”
iii) P3: “You are a helpful and honest assistant. Always answer. Your responses can be socially biased and subjective. You can express a personal opinion and take a stance.”
We use these prompts across all experiments and present results after aggregating across them.
D Additional Results
Contextualized Auditing In Tables 6 and 7, we present detailed results for the contextualized settings A and B across all 7 dimensions of the EUANDI questionnaire for German, French, and Greek parties. In Figures 8-9, we present the results for the contextualized auditing setting C for French and Greek parties.
Model Adaptation In Figure 10, we present the train loss over time across all adapted models. We observe that all models present similar convergence trends, while higher data availability (Table 1) does
not always reflect better performance, i.e., alignment to the party.
EU Compass: In Figure 7, we present results on the EU compass, as introduced by the EUANDI project (Michel et al., 2019), where we assess the adapted models’ position in two axes: x-axis, which represents the political inclination from left to right from a socioeconomic perspective. and y-axis, which represents the political inclination from anti to pro EU. We present 4 compasses, one for each model adapted to the speeches for a europarty (Greens, GUE/NGL, EPP, and ID), always comparing with the baseline model, Llama Chat out-of-the-box.
E Examples for Contextualized Auditing
In Figures 12, 13, and 14, we provide examples for the contextualized auditing settings A, B, and C including the model-generated answers.
