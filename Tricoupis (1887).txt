Chamber was unable to vote 1t im good time. The general
elections for a new Chamber followed, and we again
presented that Budget in the ensuing year; so that our
elem pets respecting it were completed rather late, and
its application has necessarily proved somewhat imperfect.
We hope that this year we shall be able to proceed in
eood time with the votes of next year’s Budget; ms ae
therefore submit early to the Chamber the bills relating
to it.

Was necessary last year, even more than on previous occas

an impasse, and it was by means of that Budget we Ls

the Budget important financial bills, nor to impose any

hat is prime Ge ct of OU BY stem waa hs re“atoration of
public eredit by the fulfilment of our State obligations,
and that it was to public credit we looked for a ae‘ttlemeatt
of our financial difficulties. But the fulfilment of the
obligations of the State presented more difficulties Jas
year than formerly; for during the time which intervened between the former situation and that which we found
last year, the State was burthened with a fresh indebtedness of 120 millions, resulting from the deficit of two rerular and two extraordinary Budgets, These figures were then called into question; it was said that it was not true that the regular and the extraordinary Budgets
for 1885 and 1886 would result in a deficit of 120 millions in all We then heard a lengthy exposition of the reasons on which the Opposition based their contention that those
deficits would in all probability prove insignificant. Now, however, we can substantiate what we then put forth.
The Chamber can now judge by the aid of figures
whether our view of the situation was nght or wrong, and
F whether or not those deficits have added to the National
| Debt 120 millions.

I do not believe we are likely to be led astray, as the

financial period of 1856, there have been collected, up to
the 30th of September, 1887, 61,515,000 from the normal
sources of income, and 952,000 from patriotic eontnbu
tions—say 62,467,000 in all. To this sum we may add about 1,000,000 for receipts during the month of October, and consequently the receipts for the financial period of the year 1886 amount to 63,467,000. These receipts fall

constitutes a deficit.
13. This sum, therefore, of 87,414,000, being added te
the deficit of 28,380,000, in the regular Budget, brings the
total deficit for the year L886 to 60, ¢ 95,000, Consequently,
the deficits for the years 1885 and 1886, taken together,
figure thus :—Regular deficit of 1885. 24,950,000; regular
deficit of 1886, 28.380 OOO: total deficit in the regular
Budgets of the two financial periods, 53,331,000, The
extraordinary expenditure in 1885 amounted to 96,757,000,
and in 1886 to 87,414,000, say 74,151,000 for the two
financial periods. Therefore, the total deficit in the
regular and extraordinary Budgets of 1885 and 1886
amounts to 127,483,000. This total, however, includes the
sume Jaid out in railroads: and if we deduct these sums,
the deficit is reduced to 119,559,000, a figure almost identical with that which we were able to submit to the Chamber last year, at a time when we had as yet no final
accounts, but only provisional statements, for 1885, and
when, as regards 1886, we were compelled to speak from
surmises based upon preliminary indications and impertect
formation.

country—if the country then declared that it was not dis
posed to submit to an increase of taxation, it would have
heen but natural for us to expect that the measures which
we intended to bring forward would have been considered
all the more burdensome at a time when the then necessary
provisions were increased by an additional charge of
10,000,000,
17. Consequently, it was our duty to show that a re
course to such measures was tnavoidable. We must even
now demonstrate this by means of facts and figures, so
that we may justify ourselves in face of those whom
we have charged with a heavy responsibility. Even after
the failure of the policy inaugurated on the ith of April,
those who have caused the increase of our financial diffi
culties have not ceased to aver that taxes have been
imposed without any necessity, that we could have ex
tricated ourselves from these difficulties by other means
even by those very means which were proposed to and
rejected by the Chamber—and that it 1s not true that our
fresh burdens are as heavy as they have been repre
sented. These assertions called for an answer, and this
answer is now given by figures which speak on our
behalf.

items of revenue, are by law ascertained and are actually

the deficit of 28,380,000, in the regular Budget, brings the
total deficit for the year L886 to 60, ¢ 95,000, Consequently,
the deficits for the years 1885 and 1886, taken together,
figure thus :—Regular deficit of 1885. 24,950,000; regular
deficit of 1886, 28.380 OOO: total deficit in the regular
Budgets of the two financial periods, 53,331,000, The
extraordinary expenditure in 1885 amounted to 96,757,000,
and in 1886 to 87,414,000, say 74,151,000 for the two
financial periods. Therefore, the total deficit in the
regular and extraordinary Budgets of 1885 and 1886
amounts to 127,483,000. This total, however, includes the

mode of ascertaining the tax will be more accurate in

results for the year 1886, and you saw that during LAaG.
when the system now abolished was in foree, the ascer
tained TEVENWE On tobacco amounted to 2 776000 leas
than the estimates. Judging now from the results to date,
as to the application of the system of levying the tax
through the cutting factories, we can safely say that the
quantity of tobacco at which the yearly consumption was
estimated is the lowest attainable figure, and that the
average consumption will certainly exceed that quantity.
We have to hand the returns of consumption every ten
days; the quantity taken as a basis for the Budget
was a consumption of 27,777 okes* every ten days. ‘The
consumption began with quantities increasing from 20 to
9? and 23 thousand okes per ten days, and during these
last ten days it reached 27,300 okes, 1.e., the proportion
on which the Budget was based, “It is a well known fact,
that some days prior to the application of the new law,
tobacconists laid in a large stock; manifestly, therefore,
when these provisions are exhausted, we shall see the
consumption lucrease again, asit increased shortly atter

computed on the lowest average; while we have reduced
on the highest average those sources of taxation with

: a 1% arrived at
only with much difficulty, yet we were able
he ia to enter into
negotiations Which were brought to a final conclusion
after the Session, but the result of which was known even
before the House rose. al. I allude to the loan of 135,000,000, which had most
beneficial results on our public debt. By means of this loan we were able to pay off debts, the interest on which
was in excess of the rate agreed to for this new loan.
We had debts for interest on which we paid 9 per cent.,
8 per cent., 74 per cent., and 7 per cent., but which, by
means of this loan, we converted into an indebtedness
the interest on which amounts to only 5°93 per cent.
This reduction of interest left in the Budget for 1887
an important credit undisposed of; in addition to which
the abolition of the sinking fund on the loans thus con
verted left also other credits undisposed of—for the new
years, and the amount required yearly for Gh Roce ipa
of a loan in seventy-five years is very small, wherena i debts we converted by means of this loan required ete

to the reorganisation of our finances.
33. But there existed another necessity, which in the
opinion of the Government took precedence, atid respecting
which, even prior to the loan, the Government had entered into negotiations and almost came to terms, though those
terms were not definite. This necessity was that of build
ing a fleet. For this purpose the 135 million loan includes
an amount o 2f6 millions which have not yet been realised,
that is to say, they do not yet bear interest, but the bonds
for which are deposited in the hands of bankers, and will

But while we were proceet )
differences cropped up and we then conceived the hope ot

amalgamate into ++ the financial combination relating to
the ships. The negotiations for the construction of the
ships had reached the point of signature, when they were
brought to a standstill by a pretension of the Company
which the Government considered inadmissible. They
required that not only should we cive guarantees for the
payment of the instalments, but that the Company ttself
should have the administration of the taxes set apart as con
stituting the guarantee given. The agreement, which, as
already stated, had nearly been concluded, fixed an eight
years’ delay, divided in six-monthly payments, and the rate
of interest was agreed at 7 per cent. The Company had
represented to the Government that they were compelled
to put forward these pretentions, owing to the difficulties
they experienced in finding the money; especially with
regard to the interest on the value of the guns, the Com

Be: at first at
1,400,000, that is to say the value of the ships was reduced from 27,400,000 to 26 millions. But we insisted that this
alculation Was erroneous and that we were fully justified
to ask for a further reduction of H00,000, After prolonged
negotiations, we succeeded in carrying this point also, not
however by a further reduction of the price ot the ships,
but by raising the issue price of the loan. As you will

to the original agreement with the Company. Beyond
this, by including in the convention for the loan of 159
millions, the arrangement for building the ships we secured
further advantages. The eight years’ bills wi vuld have borne
interest at the rate of 7 per cent., while the loan has been
contracted at 523, per cent,; moveover, we are free from
the difficulties of the payment of the eight years’ bills,
an obligation which would certainly have compelled us in
time to contract another loan from which to obtain the sums required for the payment of the instalments periodi

the then Government was equally hound as on predecas

constitutes a deficit.
13. This sum, therefore, of 87,414,000, being added te
the deficit of 28,380,000, in the regular Budget, brings the
total deficit for the year L886 to 60, ¢ 95,000, Consequently,
the deficits for the years 1885 and 1886, taken together,
figure thus :—Regular deficit of 1885. 24,950,000; regular
deficit of 1886, 28.380 OOO: total deficit in the regular
Budgets of the two financial periods, 53,331,000, The
extraordinary expenditure in 1885 amounted to 96,757,000,
and in 1886 to 87,414,000, say 74,151,000 for the two
financial periods. Therefore, the total deficit in the
regular and extraordinary Budgets of 1885 and 1886
amounts to 127,483,000. This total, however, includes the
sume Jaid out in railroads: and if we deduct these sums,
the deficit is reduced to 119,559,000, a figure almost identical with that which we were able to submit to the Chamber last year, at a time when we had as yet no final
accounts, but only provisional statements, for 1885, and
when, as regards 1886, we were compelled to speak from
surmises based upon preliminary indications and impertect
formation.
14, The expenditure for 1886, and the returns of
most severe verification, have served to the Government
as a guide in framing the Budget for 1887, Tt will per
regard to each one of the sources of revenue, we pointed
wut the changes which we deemed necessary in each
separate item, if if were determined to maintain the then
existing Jevislition, Having thus considered the items of revenue in the Budget for 1886, we urived to the

tained and collected is published monthly in the Govern

submitted to the Chamber along with the Budget, as I
have already stated. I have added that an official state

Sepiember amounted to 41,078,000: for, at present, we
must confine ourselves to amounts of revenue ascertained; the data relating to sums collected cannot guide us at
this stage, as the collection is spread over twenty-two
mouths. Up to the 30th of September, 1886, however, the sum of 41,078,000 had been ascertamed as accruing
from the exercise of the Budget of 1886, which Budget,
when revised, amounted to 76,580,000, If, therefore, the

on the same ground as those for 1886 and 1885 were

it showed a deficit, I say that this is a satisfactory in

the sums actually collected fall short of the ascertained amounts. Should the sums collected fall short of the
ascertained amounts in the same proportion as they did in

they fall short in a heavier proportion thainn the past,

with the advances secured by bonds of the 170 million
ioan held in pledge; we had to deal with debts on short
term, some of which became due on the very day we assumed office. We had to provide for all these advances;
and we were, besides, pressed by purveyors claiming pay
ment in specie, at a moment when we could neither dispose
ef specie, nor convert bank notes into specie. That
financial situation was disclosed before the Chamber, and,
moreover, it is recorded in the proposals then submitted to the Chamber.

is the present condition of the floating debt,

financial PUTPOBeS 5 if is always necessary that the Ser.
vice should have at: its disposal a limited number of such
bills by means of which it may be enabled to obtain
money provisionally, and to repay the same when the
necessity has passed. Thus the floating debt, which
pressed heavily on us at a time when we had to consider
primarily how to regulate the financial situation of the
country, has now completely disappeared, and there re
mains that small amount of Treasury Bills in circulation
which in every country, in proportion to its requirements,
is considered necessary for the working of the financial
machinery. Along with the Budget I submit full particu
lars as to everything relating to the floating debt and its
conversion into a consolidated debt, whether by means of
the 135 millions loan, or by the disposal of bonds of the 170
millions loan to those Bankers who had the option to take
them up, or by means of the agreement with the National
Bank for a loan of 15 millions. It appears to me super
fluous to go through these measures in detail, since you
will find all the information you may require in the Budget

difference between highest and lowest points reached when

could ouly be reahsed if both climatic hiatihalannas
favoured them, and the commercial situation, ae well sachs
wider circle of financial intereouras, proved propitious tf
we continued to frame our Budgets after this resi the
equilibrium would have been always a fictitious one, The
equilibrium of any Budget, even of a Budget framed
on the lowest average, always runs some Male at diaapye
pearing, since our Budgets are in reality forecasts ot
revenue only ascertained, as against eredits actually
voted.
48. The equilibrium ought never to be sought in the The basis of a i
Budget itself, but in the final balance sheet; and in order beta equi- : ) r
to obtain an equilibrium in our final accounts, we must my 1 :
have in the Budget itself a surplus of ascertained revenue
amounting to 7 or 8 millions. It is only then we can say
that the equilibrium is assured. But even if we have no
such surplus, we may still obtain an equilibrium, partly at
least, by retrenchment in the expenditure; because the
amounts of expenditure inscribed are not all disposed of,
and if the action of the Government is wisely directed
towards the limitation of expenditure, savings may be
secured even more considerable than those imposed by
Greumstances. But however considerable the reduction
in expenditure may be from such causes, whether resulting
from the normal application of the Budget or from the
enforced economics, the equilibrium cannobet a real one
if it rests on a mere balancing OF ascertained TEVORUe ai
and credits voted. We must have a surplus in the ascer
tained revenue of the Budget ; but it is | : engean 1]

public eredit by the fulfilment of our State obligations,
and that it was to public credit we looked for a ae‘ttlemeatt
of our financial difficulties. But the fulfilment of the
obligations of the State presented more difficulties Jas
year than formerly; for during the time which intervened between the former situation and that which we found
last year, the State was burthened with a fresh indebtedness of 120 millions, resulting from the deficit of two rerular and two extraordinary Budgets, These figures were then called into question; it was said that it was not true that the regular and the extraordinary Budgets
for 1885 and 1886 would result in a deficit of 120 millions in all We then heard a lengthy exposition of the reasons on which the Opposition based their contention that those
deficits would in all probability prove insignificant. Now, however, we can substantiate what we then put forth.
The Chamber can now judge by the aid of figures
whether our view of the situation was nght or wrong, and
F whether or not those deficits have added to the National
| Debt 120 millions.

that reductions will be realised equal to those which we

54. There is another matter in respect to which we Charges for
must take urgent measures. It does not relate directly prcoieir
tu the Budget, but rather to the administration, although |
t constitutes a burden on the Budget. In addition to
the expenditure voted by means of the Budget, the State
has had to bear, for some time past, a yearly charge not
mscribed in the Budget, but which now amounts to an
important sum. For years past the communes, : a
many of them, have proved unable to perform es

are framed permits us to expect that we shall have in the
final accounts of the year, not only an equilibrium, but a
surplus also. But besides the manner in which © the
Budget has been drawn up, the equilibrium is ensured and the increase of a surplus is promised by the reorganisation of the service of the public debt; and in order to be able
to reorganise our public debt, that which oceurred last Session must not now be repeated. We hope that the word
bankruptey will not be heard from this tribune during the
present Session. The prejudice caused by that expression
during the late negotiations ought to suffice to teach
those who formed appreciations so lightly, that they must
be very careful as to the language they use within these
walls) They must also take heed how they reason;
for the simple fact that there are in Greece men who
think that the solution of our difficulties is to be sought

confidence of many and to dissuade others from lending
their support to those financial combinations, from which
the restoration of our financial affairs is partly to be ex

APPENDIX,

Extracts from the Speech delivered by M. Tricoupia, on the 16th (28th) November during the Debate on the Budget,
———
_ After dwelling at some length on the Parliamentary tactics of the
Opposition, who sought to transform the debate on the Budget into a
question of confidence, M. Tricoupis proceeded to rebut the allegation
of some of the speakers that the present administration was respon
sible for the deficit of 26 millions in the Budget of 1885 when the
Opposition was in power. M. Tricoupis went on to say :
When, the other day, I introduced the Budget for
1888, l abstained from all comments on the figures; pro
perly speaking, I did not discourse on those figures,
but I simply laid them before you; I put those figures
together, and from such juxtaposition I drew my con
clusions . . . As regards these figures, we must examine
separately those which refer to the ordinary, and those
which refer to the extraordinary Budget. The Member
for Arcadia (M. DeLryAnnis) declared that the deficit on
the ordinary Budget for 1886 amounted to 26 millions;

by several members of the Opposition as regards minor points in the
Budget for 1885 as compared with those of 1886 and 1887, disproving
their contentions in each case, Passing then to the question of mon 7

fund? What would we save by such a measure? Only
4 millions per annum, &@ sum insufficient to supply the deficit of the financial exercise, such as you represent
it to be. You estimated this deficit at 15 millions, even
after the application of our measures of taxation, failing
which the deficit would have amounted to 37 millions ;
for I take it that 22 millions are derived from the taxation
we have asked the Chamber to vote. To make this deficit good, you propose the suspension of the sinking fund, namely, a saving of 4 millions, which would reduce the deficit to 33 milions; and with regard to this sum you do not propose anything at all. But I leave aside these
questions, which haye no importance at all, as very few
people believe that there exists a deficit of 15 millions; very few people believe that on your coming to office you would abolish the system of taxation introduced by us,
and still fewer are those who believe that you are likely to come to power shortly. -1 am not now dealing with the
equilibrium for 1887, as I have already spokeant length on
that subject; nor do I allude to the financial adrainistra
tion during 1887, for I have also dwelt sufficiently 00. this;
but I allude to the difficulty of procuring specie, and ib is only in relation to this difficulty that I have mentioned
the proposed solution—namely, the auspension of the

evenension of the sinking fund. By what means will you
secure the remaining 21 millions? As tar aa we aré con
corned, we have, in reward to this question, i, clearly
defined policy laid down: but we shonld hke to know
also your ideas on the matter, after a discussion which has
now lasted 0 many days, We are of opinion that the
key of the situation lies in the improvement of our eredit,
which will enable us gradually to abolish forced currency;
for it is forced currency which causes the present difficulty But,atthesame time, we arescekingand we obtaintemporary alleviations of that difficulty byfinancial combinations, based
on the equilibrium of the Budget . . . By suppressing
or suspending the sinking fund you abstract not only the
guarantee offered by the gradual repayment of the eapital,
but also the interest included in the sinking fund. And
you fancy that you can find a creditor who, while
negotiating freely with you, would willingly submit to
the suspension of the sinking fund without some equiva

of calculations showing that the State would derive advantage by such an arrangement. Inreply to our enquiry
they assured us that if we offered them a counteradvantage equal to the sacrifice proposed they would be disposed to negotiate. We have proceeded negotiating and it is not impossible that, in-regard to certain loans, we may come to terms on this basis. As regards other loans
we may possibly make arrangements by contracting a
fresh loan on more favourable terms, as was the case with
the 135 millions loan. We shall then be in a position to
say to ourcreditors that weare ready to refund the capital,
should they be unwilling te submit to the terms which
we shall propose to them.) » oo Our conviction has

you find in them any sign of weakness in the industrial or the productive capacity of the country? I do not pretend, of course, that we have reached the highest pitch of pros
perity, nor do I say the country does not still suffer in its industry and agriculture; Greece is still wanting in many of those things which constitute the prosperity of other countries. But I must also add, that Greece progresses as
rapidly as any one of the more prospering countries,
And when progress exists the question is not whence such
progress comes; the all important object is that towards
which we are speeding, and the certamty and pace at
which we are progressing towards that object. We see
no wavering in this pace since the time our new system
of taxation was imposed; we do not find the rapidity of
progress slackened or hindered; on the contrary, we see
that the country progresses at a much quicker rate, not
indeed because of the direct influencoef taxation, which
cannot be but injurious, but owimtgo the indirect benefits
aceruing from taxation—to the blessings of credit and of
labour, as evidenced by the increasing reventie from import
and stamp duties, by the tax on joint-stock companies, and
by so many other sourees of revenue constantly eel

which your vote conveyed last Session a= Ene Gregg
spurns all notion of violating her obligations, sufficed
to attract foreign capital for the restoration of onp
frances, And now, When it ia manifest that your vote
was piven advisedly, that the Greek people responded
to your decisions, readily accepting all the burdens
the sacred object of which they only considered—whep
it is proved that the country was not blindly drivey
to the adoption of a policy beyond its moral and materia] strength, but that the measures voted have succeeded in their application and have directly conduced to the financial regeneration of the country, your vote assumes its full importance and does credit both to you and to your constituents. The nation which, on the 7th of April, 1885, con. demned this our policy, having been enlightened by facts has now adopted that same policy, and has deputed yon here for the application of the very programme it had
then condemned. The nation now calls upon you to
confirm this programme by recording your vote in
favour of the Budget for 1888; and as your vote on the
Budget of the current year has proved most profitable to
the country, even so, you may rest assured, will the vote
which we ask of you to-day be beneficial, answering as it
does in all respects to the hopes, the interests, and the
obligations of the nation, (Great applause.)

The country had the requisite material
force: OW ers
also On the 7th April, but if lacked moral force, Now,
however, the nation 18 strony in its convictions, as
proved by the elections of the Ath January, and by elec
Hons subsequent to the application of the new financial
measures. ‘Those elections proved that the Greek people are willing to submit to the sacrifices necessary for the restoration and consolidation of their credit, that they
understand that it is only by means of credit that produc
tion can revive and suffice to the requirements of
the country, and that by means of credit only can we
fulfil our obligations. The nation has understood all this
at last, and it is for this reason it reversed the policy which had been brought about by the vote of the 7th of April. Having reversed that policy, it accepted the system
mtroduced by us and has consented to bear the conse
quences of that system. The main consequence of that system is labour; it is only by increased labour that our
people can make good the sacrifices demanded of them.
The nation has devoted itself to labour, and has given
proots to the world of the objects of its labour. But m
order to carry out steadily and unfalterimgly the policy im
favour of which the people have declared, we require, not
whom the people have sent here to record a decision
after thoroughly examining the financial system whereby the will of the people is to take effeet,
