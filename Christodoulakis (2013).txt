Currency crisis and collapse

Predicament or Policy Failure?

ABSTRACT
Greece in 1928 viewed the anchoring to the Gold Exchange Standard as
the imperative choice of the time in order to implant financial credibility
and carry over an ambitious plan of reforms to modernise the economy.
But after the pound sterling exited the system in 1931, Greece, instead
of following suit, chose a defence that drove interest rates at high levels,
squeezed the real economy and exhausted foreign reserves. Unable to
borrow from abroad, it quitted the system in 1932 and the Drachma was
heavily devalued. Despite a rise in competitiveness, the erosion of real
incomes cut domestic demand, unemployment continued to rise and the
country entered a period of acute social and political instability. The
lessons are perhaps relevant today for the costs that Greece would face
by exiting the Eurozone.
A model of Balance of Payments crises with partial capital controls is
employed to analyze the response of currency pegs to external shocks
and examine under which circumstances the regime collapses. Its main
predictions are found to be in agreement with the actual outcomes in
1932

Currency crisis and collapse
in interwar Greece:
Predicament or Policy Failure?
1. Introduction
A byproduct of the current Greek debt crisis is a thriving literature based
on the intellectual speculation – sometimes on a market one as well 
that Greece is bound to fail the stabilization process and, therefore, exit
the Eurozone and default. The argument goes that under the present
fiscal austerity and currency fixity, recession will deepen destroying jobs
and igniting social unrest; see Roubini (2011). After abandoning the
Euro, Greece is assumed to become master of its fate so that she prints
her own money, rebukes the austerity program, and – of course 
devalues, perhaps heavily. A concomitant option would be to repudiate
obligations since all public debt is presently denominated in Euro and a
steep devaluation would make its servicing intolerable; see Feldstein
(2011). But, the argument continues, this is an affordable cost as the
economy soon will assume a growth path, with competitiveness and
employment restored, and reforms advancing; see Azariadis (2011).
If not convincing enough, the above arguments are enriched by historical
clichés, according to which Greece will fail because under similar
circumstances it has also failed in the past. Hartwich (2011) argues that
one such episode was the country leaving the Latin Monetary Union
(LMU) in 1908 and concludes that “Greece is a basket case”. However,


2
the important fact rather was that Greece successfully managed to stay
in LMU for forty years (since 1868), overcoming major deficiencies in the
domestic economy and the challenge of globalization in late 19th
century; for a description see Lazaretou (1999). It was only after the ill
fated war in 1897 that Greece became unable to service the debt and
pay retributions to Ottoman Turkey, that LMU participation looked
untenable. In any case Greece joined back in 1910, but only for a few
more years as most members exited the system after the outbreak of
the Great War in 1914.
The second and oft cited incident took place in 1932 when Greece
abandoned the interwar Gold Exchange Standard (GES) and
subsequently repudiated its debt. In contrast to conventional wisdom,
neither the collapse was predetermined by some Greek history dictation,
nor the post-collapse regime managed to cure the economic and social
problems of the period. The same applies for the current situation in
Greece, as recession is looming and the scenario of failing to stay in the
Eurozone is advanced both by international analysts and critics at home1
However, whether Greece fails or succeeds on this matter is an issue of
policy, not one of fate.
In this respect, it is useful to analyze the causes and consequences of the
crisis in the 1930s and the present paper sets to analyze three points:
First, to explain why joining the GES was a fully justified decision that
helped Greece to ensure fiscal stability, acquire international credibility
and establish access to low-cost finance. In comparison with the
previous situation, improvement within the GES has been enormous. In

3
the 1920s, Greece was experiencing the contradicting consequences of
being first a victorious power in the Great War and then a defeated
nation in the campaign in Asia Minor, only a few years later. Greece had
to rapidly absorb two million national refugees and integrate them in the
economic and social framework. At the same time she had to modernize
the economy and facilitate the financing of major productive projects to
enhance regional development. A turning point was when the centre-left
Party of Liberals won the elections of 1926. The new Government sought
a more liberalized environment in trade and industry, the reduction of
fiscal deficits and the establishment of a Central Bank that was deemed
as a precondition for raising credibility in international markets, reducing
the cost of borrowing and servicing the war-swollen debt. The crucial
next step was participation in GES, and the decision was finally taken in
1928. Authorities viewed the anchoring to Gold as the unique choice to
implant financial credibility and carry over an ambitious plan for the
modernisation of the economy.
Within the GES, Greece managed a successful implementation of fiscal
and structural policies in the domestic economy. In just two years,
public deficit and inflation were reduced, and several structural reforms
were implemented to create a more liberalized economic environment
and modernize the banking system. The Balance of Payments improved
noticeably and growth resumed. Public debt in US dollars was reduced
to almost half the level it had in the previous decade.
The second aim of the paper is to describe the policy failures that led to
the currency regime collapsing in 1932, despite the previous adjustment
efforts. The pressure started to accumulate with the Great Depression,


4
though the Greek economy was not immediately hit as happened with
other economies. Adherence to the GES remained unquestionable
throughout, though fiscal austerity and a rise in interest rates dampened
growth and unemployment started to rise. However, the main shock
came when the pound sterling abandoned the system in September
1931 sparking international panic and precipitating similar moves by
other countries. Keeping most of the foreign exchange reserves in British
currency, Greece incurred serious losses and defenses against a
speculative attack abruptly weakened. At that point, Greek authorities
made the critical mistake not to orderly follow the depreciation of the
pound, but instead chose to fight for staying in the GES to the bitter end.
As no international credit facility – let alone financial solidarity from
other members of the system– was available at that time the game soon
was over and Greece finally collapsed in April 1932.
The third aim of the paper is to describe the consequences that
abandonment of the GES had on the domestic front. Instead of a
transition to a stable economy, the steep devaluation and the ensuing
inflation eroded domestic demand and unemployment increased
further, while debt repudiation tarnished the country’s credibility for
many years and led to a dramatic political fall-out. If anything, the crisis
and default of the 1930s is a lesson to be avoided rather than copied.
The literature on Balance of Payments crises is employed to analyze the
response of currency pegs to external shocks and see under which
circumstances the regime becomes untenable. Building a dynamic model
of foreign exchange reserves and the exchange rate, the paper explains
the way the regime finally collapsed and highlights some policy


5
alternatives that could have been followed in 1931. In the early models
developed by Krugman (1979) and Calvo (1987), collapse is taking place
in predetermined time, when domestic credit follows a constant growth
rate known to market participants. That was not the case for Greece in
1931, where the fight to stay in the system lasted more than six months
and the decision to abandon it was taken by the Government amid fears
that reserves would be otherwise completely vanished. In Greece, credit
growth was randomly influenced by the Central Bank, and, moreover,
the imposition of some capital controls in 1931 meant that market
players were not able to fully enforce their strategy. In the present
formulation, partial capital controls are assumed to be in place and
collapse occurs when the stock of foreign reserves falls to a critical level
known only to the authorities. A unique equilibrium is derived and the
predictions of the model are found to be in agreement with actual
developments before and after the crisis.
The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 provides a brief
account of the reasons that led Greece along several western countries
to adopt the Gold Exchange Standard. Section 3 describes the main
episodes in defending the regime and the policies that aggravated
recession and ultimately led to the collapse of the currency. Section 4
presents a simple model of Balance of Payments crises, which is
modified to portray how the Central Bank can use the level of foreign
exchange reserves to mitigate the excessive rise in interest rates when
an adverse shock hits the economy. Section 5 concludes.

2. The quest for stability in Greece
In the aftermath of the First World War, European nations were
experiencing economic instability associated with exchange rate
fluctuations, rampant inflation and lack of financing. In 1919, the United
States decided to adopt the Gold Standard and this prompted the
League of Nations to organize, one year later, the Paris Conference
seeking exchange rate stability and some form of returning to the Gold
Standard. The plan was based on complicated requirements, thus it was
no wonder that little progress followed the proclamation. It was only
after the horrifying shock of German hyperinflation in 1922, that the
victor countries finally decided to endorse exchange rate fixity as the key
factor to achieve economic stability. The Gold Exchange Standard was
established at the Genoa Conference in 1922 and several countries
rushed to join-in.
The European postwar malaise notwithstanding, Greece was further hit
in the early 1920s by its defeat in Asia Minor and the anomalous political
situation that prevailed afterwards. As shown in Figure 1, public debt
had reached alarming levels, first because of the military spending
during World War I, and then because of the huge burden of the ill-fated
campaign. The implementation of reforms looked implausible, inflation
was at levels over 80% (see Figure 2), and the Drachma was unstoppably
losing ground to both the UK sterling and the US dollar, (Figure 3).
Greek money markets were suffering from the Drachma slide and there
was massive capital flight to foreign banks. With a thin financing capacity
at home, the government had to rely heavily on borrowing from
international markets. In fact, most of the major loans were launched in


7
London and New York, and this made domestic investment activity to
depend crucially on the capital inflows; for example, a loan of £ 4 m
issued in London in 1928 was earmarked to finance specific investment
projects. Besides, as pointed by Lazaretou (1999), borrowing from
international markets was also seen as a way to encourage repatriation
of Greek funds.
As regularity of debt payments was not taken for granted, the question
of Greek solvency was receiving extensive foreign press coverage. A
documentation of how foreign investors adjusted their expectations
about the viability of the financial system is given by Christodoulaki and
Penzer (2004). As a proxy measure of the increasing market anxiety, they
calculate a dominance index of the (usually bad) news on Greek debt
developments relative to total information on Greece appearing in the
British press and find it to rise steeply after 1925. Nervousness was
spreading and sometimes led to openly hostile actions. The authors note
one such case, in which the Allies got so estranged by domestic political
developments that they cancelled the Book of Credits and imposed a
general financial embargo on Greece. From the status of an acclaimed
war ally, the country lost face in the post-war market fields.
In such an environment, joining the Gold Standard was rightly seen as a
precondition to facilitate the influx of foreign capital essential for
economic growth. The first step was the establishment of the Central
Bank in April 1928 aiming to persuade foreign investors that financial
practises would be more credible, and in May 1928 Greece joined the
GES. As noted by Bordo and Rockoff (1996), adherence to the Gold
Standard in the 1920s acted as a ‘seal of approval’ for sovereign debt of


8
participant countries, and helped Greece as well to improve her status in
international markets.
Improvement, however, was not to the extent envisaged by Greek
authorities. Recent econometric evidence by Obstfeld and Taylor (2003)
on interwar markets suggests that the return to the Gold Standard after
the Great War did confer lower sovereign spreads to participants on
servicing their debt. They note, however, that improvement neither
reached the extent of the period before 1914, nor it was equally shared
by all countries. In fact, Greece did not enjoy much of the reduced
spreads in the pre-war system either, during which she was paying a
large risk premium of 215 basis points, while most other countries were
enjoying a zero spread. A similar discrepancy was experienced by Greece
in the GES, for three reasons:
First, because international investors scrutinized more carefully than
before the sustainability of trade balances in each country and the
appropriateness of the exchange rate level when entering the GES.
Greece was characterized by chronic deficits (see Figure 4) and fixing the
Drachma to the pre-war exchange rate with the UK pound sterling did
not appear convincing as a cure for existing imbalances. By deciding this
rate, Greece hoped to convey a signal of international clout in the
domestic political scene as a firm partner of Britain, but on economic
grounds the decision was unfounded given the slim trade volumes
between the two countries. In the second half of the 1920s, Greek
exports to the UK were counting for only 12.2% of total volumes, while
imports from the UK for just 13.4%. Trade volumes with the US were
considerably higher, as were with Germany and Italy, and the exchange


9
rate should have been pegged to an average of the major trading
currencies. Moreover, the British rate itself was out of context as Keynes
famously remarked2 in account of the miscalculated restoration to its
pre-war value. Shortly after, Great Britain went through a severe
recession and, due to the credit meanness that prevailed, its industrial
competitiveness was seriously undercut. Greece just copied the
miscalculation and multiplied the consequences.
Second, because Greece entered the GES too late and soon afterwards
international recession was looming and undermined most of the
expected benefits from an increased world demand. Domestic discount
rates were reduced by 1929, but then rose again in 1931 to reflect the
tightening of international credit after the Great Depression. The
contraction in domestic credit cut domestic demand and the economy
soon entered a period of prolonged recession.
Third, because of the devastating competitive devaluations that
followed: With recession spreading and deepening worldwide, the
attractiveness of the GES was eroded and eventually abandonment
became inevitable for many countries. After Greece joined in 1928, only
three more countries followed, as the storm was gathering3: France
joined the GES in September 1928, but only after a substantial
devaluation of the franc; Japan joined in January 1930 but exited before
the end of 1931, and, finally, Portugal made the shortest journey
entering in July 1931 and jumping out of the ship just three months
later. Similarly, the Nordic countries suspended the GES and devalued

10
their currencies in 1931. Eichengreen and Sachs (1985) document that
all countries that either de jure or de facto devalued their currencies in
the 1930s, came out of the recession faster. They note that in order to
face economic downturn in the early 1930s, European nations could
have conceived various policies to pursue, among them ‘... devaluation,
protection, monetary expansion and fiscal stimulus’. But none of these
policies was considered within the GES.
In fact, the countries remaining in the GES were further tightening their
monetary policy and this was hitting the borrowing costs for Greece. For
example, the Bank of England raised the discount rate more than
twofold, from 2.5% in May 1931 to 6% in September, in her own struggle
to sustain the exchange rate parity. Expectedly, the appetite of London
investors for Greek bonds declined en masse and, as result, the Greek
economy was suffering both from credit shortage and capital flights
abroad that were further exacerbating domestic contraction. In such an
adverse international environment, Greece was refusing to consider a
devaluation of the Drachma and vowed to bear any cost for staying in
the system. But this was only making investors even more uncertain and
speculators even more determined. The fight for the GES at the end
became ideological and soon lost touch with the reality of markets.
Adopting the economic orthodoxies prevailing at that time, the Greek
Government ignored the perils of recession and embarked on an
overzealous fiscal stance to convince worrying foreign investors about its
determination to stay in the system. The preoccupation with fiscal and
monetary straightjackets was so overwhelming, that the Party of Liberals
opposed even its own previous legislation on a social security system


11
and work-time regulations, disregarding hostility from the unions and
risking social unrest. The fiscal effort was effective, and Figure 5 shows
that it managed to achieve small budget surpluses in 1931. But in spite
of the success in harnessing the deficit, the economy was reaching its
limits when major new shocks occurred shortly.
3. Sliding on the golden edge: fight, flight and failure
The Greek Government was taken by sheer surprise when the UK
abandoned the GES in September 1931 and devalued by 35% to the US
Dollar. The move was declared by Greek authorities4 as “the strongest
possible shock”, and quickly reverberated on many fronts. Politically, the
Government lost face as the unilateral act tarnished its long-nourished
reputation for being a strategic partner with the UK. In financial terms,
distress was even harder. As noted by Eichengreen (2012), the Bank of
England had previously reassured foreign central banks of its unwavering
support for the prevailing sterling exchange rate. Convinced of such
assurances, Greece had augmented foreign reserves in pound sterling
just a few months before by selling gold to the Bank of England, thus
incurring sizeable losses on the eve of the British abandonment. As a
scapegoat, the Governor of the Bank of Greece was asked to resign the
very same day.
Instead of the Drachma following the British move and depreciate
analogously, Greece acted with the perseverance of a late proselyte. The
determination to stay in the GES was reaffirmed in a joint meeting
4 Bank of Greece, 1932, “The Governor’s Report for Year 1931”, (ch. xii), as quoted by Psalidopoulos (2011, p. 85).


12
between the Prime Minister, Central Bank and commercial banks. The
decision was openly objected by the Chief Economist of the Bank and
the League of Nations representative in Greece5, but their argument was
fiercely opposed by commercial banks that feared their reserves would
be diminished by a drastic devaluation6. The Government finally vowed
to stay in the GES by shifting the peg to the US Dollar at the rate implied
before the devaluation of the British pound, (i.e. 375 Drs per BPS/4.866
BPS per USD = 77.05 Drachmas per Dollar). To reassure markets about
their stance, authorities moved decisively in three ways:
First, by adhering to a rigorous fiscal stance as described above. The
political investment to the GES was so deeply rooted that it made the
Government to ignore the recessionary effects and the steep rise in
unemployment; see Figure 6 and 7 respectively. Even left-wing radicals
in the Party of Liberals went to the point to criticize the Government for
not being as determined as to reduce public consumption further
(Mazower, 2002, p 215).
Second, by raising the Bank lending rate in order to restrain domestic
credit expansion. As often happens in similar cases, playing with high
interest rates was considered as a political show-off against speculators.
In a defiant mood, the Prime Minister himself called authorities “... not
to hesitate to raise interest rates to 20% or even to 50% if deemed
necessary”, (Mazower, 2002, p 211).
5 As described in Bank of Greece (1978), The first fifty years, p. 93. 6 Commenting upon a similar decision by the UK the year before, Keynes noted that ‘...the decision to maintain the gold standard at all costs has been taken ... in a spirit of hysteria and without a calm consideration of the alternative before us’, (in the essay “On the eve of the Gold suspension”, 1931).


13
Third, by imposing capital controls to curb the ensuing capital flight.
Market players considered this decision as a ‘de facto’ partial
abandonment of convertibility, and fears spread that the country may
eventually exit the system, and expectations were adjusted accordingly.
The decision to suspend the Stock Exchange in September 1931 in order
to avoid sell-out hysteria fuelled more fears that the Government is in a
precarious situation and may not succeed for long in keeping with the
GES.
Domestic funds were fleeing for yet another time and authorities
responded by setting interest rates even higher and the discount rate
climbed up to 12%; see Figure 8. But such a rise was choking off liquidity,
thus aggravating the dysfunction of the economy and reinforcing
pessimistic expectations in the market. Access to international
borrowing was further curtailed and the government was in a difficult
situation, since it was strategically dependent on international capital
inflows and ‘... their shortage was making it inactive and waiting, with
the hope that eventually flows would start again’; see (Mazower, 2002,
p. 214).
With credibility undermined from the start, panic and speculation soon
reigned in and sparked a chain of events. As contraction in activity and
liquidity led to widespread protests in the autumn of 1931, industries
pressed commercial banks to raise liquidity capital. With much of private
deposits withdrawn by worried creditors, commercial banks turned for
help to the Central Bank, thus effectively enforcing her to act as “a
lender of last resort” and sacrifice a substantial part of its foreign
reserves.


14
The effectiveness of monetary policy was put in further doubt when the
Bank of Greece took the controversial decision to provide credit facilities
directly to industry. Mazower (2002, p 199) attributes the action to the
ambition of the Bank of Greece to antagonize commercial banks by
opening new branches and offering cheap loans to selected local
markets. Kostis (1986) describes this phenomenon as a “complete
paradox” which undermined efficacy at critical moments, while
Minoglou (1995) asserts that confusion between its supervisory and
credit-providing roles perpetuated the crisis. Whatever the motivation,
the result of further credit expansion was that foreign exchange reserves
were depleted fast as shown in Figure 9, precipitating the abandonment
of the regime as analyzed in the next section.
With reserves depleting, a proposal was publicly put forward7 for Greece
to declare a unilateral moratorium on debt payments. The Government
initially rejected the proposal, but then included a softer version of it in a
last attempt to defend its position. Seeking financial assistance from the
League of Nations and the UK, Greece asked in January 1932 for a 5-year
moratorium on foreign debt servicing and a new loan of pound sterling
12.5 million to finance infrastructural projects and enhance growth.
After months of procrastination, the League rejected the request8 and
the Government finally realized that the situation was no more
defensible. To avoid a disorderly collapse, a Law was passed by
Parliament and the system was officially abandoned in April 1932. The
Drachma devalued and subsequently foreign obligations were

15
repudiated. Post-default, the Bank of Greece sought a compromise with
foreign bond-holders proposing to compensate them at 30% of the
nominal value. After some initial protestations, most holders had
accepted the offer by the end of 1932.
The economic consequences of devaluation were mixed. Since the
abandonment of the GES took place not as a controlled shift in economic
strategy but as an unavoidable failure of policy, it did not usher in a
period of stability. The ensuing inflation in 1932 (Figure 2) cut real
wages, but industrial production continue to shrink and rose mildly only
after 1933 (Figure 6) Trade balance improved, as shown in Figure 4, but
the improvement came mainly from the reduction of imports9 by USD 49
million due to the fall of real incomes and the imposition of tariffs. At the
same time exports fell too by USD 20 million, most probably because
protectionism was spreading in many European countries inhibiting an
export-led growth in other economies. In 1934 both exports and imports
were -45% lower than their 1931levels, thus trade imbalance was also
reduced by nearly half.
Agricultural production did not rise, suffering from the contraction of
world demand, while rural incomes were falling due to the deterioration
in the terms of trade. In some sectors the decline was massive. For
example, the production of tobacco was halved in 1932 in comparison to
the previous year, causing abject poverty10 and fermenting political
discontent.
9 Data are taken from Bank of Greece (1978), The first fifty years, Table 10, p. 105. 10 In his description of the period, Psalidopoulos (2011, p. 69) notes that the rural populations were living in “desperate conditions”.


16
In spite of the devaluation, uncertainties continued to prevail in the
labour market. Several firms were finding it easier to meet higher
production by extending work time rather than hiring new employees, at
least before the political and social situation is stabilized. In such an
environment employment exhibited a strong hysteresis and did not
recover along the rise in industrial production. In 1932, employment
ended almost 15% lower according to Lazaretou (2009, p 34) and
unemployment kept rising as depicted in Figure 7. Employment
hysteresis was also the case in other countries for the same reason of
widespread uncertainties. For example, Blanchard and Summers (1986)
note the persistent increase in unemployment in the US in the 1930s,
which only subsided during the War. Unemployment in Greece declined
only in the second half of the decade after major political changes have
taken place that brutally destroyed trade unions and sent their
representatives in exile.
The political fall-out was dramatic, and in the next four years the country
went through a unique process of disintegration and chaos. There have
been four elections (1932, 1933, 1935 and 1936), an assassination
attempt against the crisis Prime Minister, one election boycott and four
military coup d’ etats. The first two attempts of seizing power were
initiated by supporters of the Party of Liberals and, after failing, their
leaders were summarily executed. the third coup was pro-royal and
managed to restore the monarchy through an allegedly rigged
referendum. As unemployment continued to surge, social clashes
intensified and finally a pro-fascist dictatorship was imposed by yet
another coup in 1936.


17
4. Modeling the currency crisis
To study the interaction between pressure on the exchange rate and
depletion of foreign exchange reserves, a simple dynamic model is set
up. It broadly falls in the framework of Balance of Payments crises,
properly modified to reflect particular developments during the Greek
crisis. Variables are in Roman case, expressed in continuous-time, with
an over-dot denoting time-derivatives, superscript (e) expectations,
small case expressing natural logarithms, and a star indicating
equilibrium values. Parameters are in Greek case.
The Central Bank:
The exchange rate is fixed at a predetermined level 0
X = X of domestic
units per foreign currency of the anchor country, so that an increase in X
denotes depreciation. Other countries in the GES are assumed to have
an average exchange rate Z vis-à-vis the anchor currency, so that the
bilateral exchange rate of home country is X/Z of domestic units per
currency of non-anchor members.
The Bank controls money supply (M) so as to keep domestic inflation (π)
at the same level as other GES countries, i.e. W
π ≈π , ensuring purchasing
power parity under the peg. The Central Bank keeps international assets
(Q), the major part of which is held in interest-bearing accounts in
foreign currency and the rest in gold. For simplicity, it is assumed that a
uniform return equal to the foreign interest rate (r) is paid on the total
stock of reserves and the net profit (rQ Q)
•
− is collected by the
Government. The balance sheet of the Central Bank in domestic book
value requires that


18
D + Q ⋅ X = M (1)
where (D) is domestic credit. To sterilize changes in reserves from
reaching the money aggregates, credit is adjusted to changes in foreign
reserves.
The real economy:
The resource constraint implies that
Y = C + I + G + J (2)
where Y is output produced in the economy. C is consumption, J denotes
exports net of imports and G is public spending, while private
investment ( I ) is assumed exogenous in the short run and thus the
capital stock does not interact with the rest of the model. However, a
rudimentary process of labour demand can be modeled to account for
the persistence of unemployment discussed in the previous section. If
( L ) households supply their labour, a linear production function with
constant returns to scale can be written as Y = Φ ⋅ (Lh) , where (h) is
worktime and (Φ) a technology constant. The number of employees is
adjusted with a hysteresis, at a rate
()
Y
LL
h
=λ −
Φ (3)
The higher the value of parameter (λ), the slower the adjustment of
employment to new demand. Given that worktime regulation was very
weak, an increase in production could be absorbed by extending working
hours, so again unemployment could persist in spite of the rise in
output.


19
Domestic households receive all the income and invest their savings on
Government bonds with a return (R). Assuming a lump-sum tax ( T ) on
households, the Private Sector Constraint (PSC) dictates that changes in
their wealth (A) are given by
A RA (Y C T I )
•
= + − − − (4)
The Government:
The Government issues a total stock of debt (B), which is financed by
domestic households (A) and foreign capital inflows (F). The Government
budget constraint (GBC) requires that:
B RB G T Q rQ
••
= + − + − (5)
In 1931-32 authorities were maintaining a balanced budget policy, as it is
clearly demonstrated in Figure 4. To capture this fact, fiscal policy is
considered exogenously set, as in Krugman (1978) and Calvo (1987), in
such a way as to keep gross budget deficits at zero level. Hence, there is
no need for further modelling the intertemporal budget constraint.
Domestic assets (R) differ from the yield (r) on foreign assets by a
sovereign spread ( s = R − r ). Differentiating total debt (B=A+F), using (4),
(5) and the output identity (2), new capital inflows in each period are
given by:
F (r s)F Q rQ J
••
= + + − − (6)
The equation represents the External Solvency Constraint (ESC). It is
obvious that by observing GBC and ESC, the process PSC is also
stabilized. The constraint implies that in each period, new capital flows


20
are needed to finance the trade deficit ( −J ) and the interest payments
to foreign investors, as well as to raise foreign exchange reserves on a
net basis. As a matter of fact, one third of the Stabilization Loan of £ 9
million issued in London in 1927 on behalf of the Hellenic Republic was
earmarked for setting up the reserves of the Central Bank.
In the absence of inflation differentials, net exports are approximated by
an increasing function of nominal exchange log-rates (x) and (x-z) vis-à
vis the anchor and the non-anchor countries respectively, and an index
of world demand (W), while decreasing with domestic demand, i.e.
01 2 3 4
J = β + β ⋅ x + β ⋅ (x − z) + β ⋅W −β ⋅Y (7)
Parameters 1 2
β,β are proxies for price elasticities of net exports, 3 4
β ,β
are the propensities of foreign and domestic demand respectively, and
β0 is a constant.
Capital markets:
In the models developed by Krugman (1979) and Calvo (1987), collapse
occurs at some predetermined point in time when foreign reserves are
exhausted by a constant rate of credit expansion known to the market
players. Foreseeing this, they organize a speculative attack and the
system collapses before all reserves are depleted. That was not the case
in Greece in 1931-32, for two reasons: First, because credit provision
was occasionally boosted by the Central Bank as described in the
previous section, making it to resemble more with the stochastic setting
developed by Flood and Garber (1984). Second because of the presence
of capital controls, that did not allow market players to fully enforce


21
their strategy. To treat this analytically, suppose that the extent of
capital controls is measured by (θ).
In the absence of controls (θ=0), sovereign yield spreads cover the
depreciation expected to take place in the eventuality of the peg
collapsing. On the other hand, if fully constrained by capital controls
(θ=1), market participants would form expectations by calculating some
kind of pressure on the currency. If, for example, they think that a viable
exchange rate should be at a new level (U), the pressure is expressed in
log terms by (u-x). The viable level (u) is not known with certainty11 and
perceptions about it may change. This makes the time of collapse not
perfectly foreseen by market participants. With capital controls partly
effective (0<θ<1), the expectation of exchange rate depreciation is given
in log-form by:
(1 )( ) ( )
xe = −θ R − r +θγ u − x (8)
where (γ) is a ‘pressure’ parameter12. As a matter of fact, capital controls
imposed in 1931 were only partly observed and the Governor of the
Bank was sacked in account of his inability to fully enforce them.
In a currency peg, the spread is a typical measure of nervousness in the
forex market and currency crises are almost invariably preceded by
explosive patterns of spreads. An index of exchange market pressure
based on the evolution of spreads and international reserves was initially
proposed by the seminal paper of Girton and Roper (1977), and
11 In 1932 there was a vast disagreement on what would be the adjustment rate in case the Drachma abandoned the GES, see Mazower (2002, p. 233) 12 In the first term of the r.h.s., capital controls act as a tax on profits from forex transactions, as described in Agenor and Flood (1994).


22
subsequently a vast number of applications employed similar measures
for the identification of a currency crisis; see, among many others,
Eichengreen et al. (1995). The justification is that low spreads are
associated with credible exchange rate regimes, while high premia unveil
uncertainty about their viability. In the approach by Hellwig et al. (2006),
investors take into account the risk of default, thus the gap between
demand and supply of domestic bonds closes by offering satisfactorily
high spreads over the foreign yield. This is a mechanism that may lead to
a currency crisis, if investors have pre-committed to liquidate after
spreads reach a “threshold point”. Krugman (1991) refers to several
occasions that a currency regime is at risk to explode if future contracts
with automatic clauses are activated after certain safety margins are
reached. As highlighted by Dornbush (1991), the fear felt by the
individual investor that - unless a currency position is reversed
immediately - major losses may happen later, leads to “bandwagon”
effects and soon the market fails. In other cases a run-away may be
triggered simply when investors are risk-averse and adopt stop-loss
schemes to limit their exposure. In all these cases, the behaviour of
spreads becomes strategic for the survival of the currency regime.
In practice the evolution of spreads and reserves may not be
independent from each other. As studied by Lahiri and Vegh (2007),
authorities may also be preoccupied by hikes in spreads not just because
the higher cost of debt servicing, but also because of the effect that
rising interest rates exert on domestic activity. In such cases, authorities
may sacrifice part of foreign exchange reserves to boost credit according
to (1) and thus domestic demand. Reflecting the above, a simple


23
negative relationship13 between sovereign spreads and the stock of
reserves is postulated as:
s = σ−ηQ (9)
where (σ, η) are parameters14. To empirically investigate the interaction
between spread and reserves in the 1930s, one needs high frequency
data, especially for the period of crisis. Though monthly data for
sovereign yields have been calculated by the Bank of Greece and span
the period 1929-1940, they are missing for the critical period as the
Athens Stock Exchange was suspended from September 1931 until
March 1932. Taking into account that the majority of foreign bond
holders were British15,, the sovereign spread is constructed by taking the
difference between Greek yields quoted in London and the yield on the
2.5% British consol. As shown in Figure 8, sovereign bond yields quoted
in London were comparable with those in Athens until September 1931.
A strong negative correlation with foreign reserves as implied by (9) is
displayed in Figure 10.
Data series16 are found to imply that Granger-causality from reserves to
spreads cannot be rejected at the 1% level, while it is heavily so the
other way around. Using a dummy for the increased market pressure
13 A negative relationship between foreign reserves and sovereign spreads has been examined for Greece during the period 1994-2000 of convergence to the European Monetary Union by Christodoulakis (2010). 14 In expression (9) the depletion of reserves accelerates the fear of a regime collapsing, and this may also be taken to imply that sovereign spreads are influenced by the collapse probability as described in Krugman and Obstfeld (1991). 15According to the Bank of Greece (1978, p. 107), 67% of foreign creditors were British, 10% US and 7.5% French,. 16 Similar findings are established when the differential between the Central Banks’ discount rates in Greece and UK is employed instead of the sovereign yield. Results are available upon request.

after the UK abandoned the GES, estimates are obtained for the
following more general form:

* ( -1) * ( -1)
*[ ( -1)] * _ _ _1931
spread a a spread t a reserves t
a change in reserves t a UK post Sept
=+ −
− + (10)
Various forms are estimated including absolute or proportional changes
in reserves and shown in Table 2 in Appendix C. Parameter values are
found correctly signed and statistically significant in all cases, and this is
taken as supportive evidence for the postulated relationship. To avoid
unnecessary complications17, the simpler expression (9) is subsequently
used in studying the dynamics of the model.
Dynamics
As described in the previous section, new financing from abroad was
dried-up after the pound exited the GES in September 193118, and Figure
1 shows that debt remained virtually the same between 1931 and 1932.
To capture the paucity of borrowing, foreign debt liabilities (F) are
assumed to remain constant, i.e.
_
F 0 and F F
•
= ≈ . Substituting (9) into (6)
and (8), the dynamics of foreign reserves and the exchange rate are
finally obtained as:
__
0 12 2 3 4
Q = (r +ηF)⋅Q +β + (β +β )x −β z +βW −βY − (r +σ)⋅ F (11a)
(1 ) ( ) (1 )
xe = −η −θ ⋅ Q +θγ⋅ u − x + −θ σ (11b)
17 When the full form (10) is used, a similar solution is obtained, though the analysis becomes more complicated without adding any new insight. Details are given in Appendix B. 18 According to Psalidopoulos (2011) the Government made desperate attempts for a new loan, but “international financial markets, on which Greece was relying for its needs in capital flows, were not responding to the Greek appeals”, (p. 69, my translation).


25
Equation (11a) describes that reserves accumulate by trade surpluses
and diminish by payments to foreign debt holders. Equation (11b)
implies that depreciation expectations increase when reserves are
diminished and/or devaluation pressure (u-x) rises. This is a situation
analogous to that described by Dornbusch (1987), where the
expectations of market agents regarding the transition from a fixed to a
floating regime are influenced by reserves behaviour and devaluation
pressure in each period, as expressed by the first and second term in the
r.h.s. respectively.
The solution is described in Appendix B and, conditional on a minimum
degree of capital controls, is found to be saddle-path stable at point (E0)
as shown in Figure 11.
When an adverse shock impinges upon the domestic economy, say due
to a permanent depreciation of the non-anchor countries exchange rate
(z → z+dz), or a world depression (W → W − dW ) the saddle-path moves
upwards. The new equilibrium is obtained at (E1), which implies a higher
(i.e. depreciated) exchange rate X1 , as shown in Figure 12. In a currency
peg there are three options to confront this situation:
(i) Defense: As turned out to be the case in practice, authorities chose to
stay in the system and defend the exchange rate parity. In the graphics
of Figure 12, this implies that the system slides along the horizontal
locus at 0
X = X while foreign exchange reserves are depleting, (i.e. Q is
falling). When they reach a critical level (QMIN) the system is abandoned
and the exchange rate overshoots to the saddle-path at point E2 from
which it subsequently free- floats to the new equilibrium E1 . The time


26
profile in Figure 13 closely resembles the actual trajectory of exchange
rate overshooting and adjustment that took place in 1932-33 and is
shown in Figure 3.
Following the currency path, net exports rise strongly in the aftermath of
devaluation, though later somewhat decline due to the partial
revaluation 2 1
E E towards the new equilibrium. The pattern shown in
Figure 14 captures the actual behaviour shown in Figure 4. The
improvement in the trade balance gradually augments foreign reserves,
though not necessarily to the same level as before the crisis. The reason
might be that the risk premium had risen (i.e. a higher σ ) or in the
meanwhile capital controls were expanded (i.e. a higher θ ), hence the
asymmetric post-collapse rise in Figure 15. Again, this is in line with the
actual accumulation pattern of reserves after 1932 as depicted in Figure
9.
(ii) Adjust to a new exchange rate X1 : Though the option was advanced
by some officials as mentioned in the previous section, it finally did not
go through. If chosen, it would have implied an immediate depreciation
of the Drachma against the anchor currency by an amount so as to
neutralize the British depreciation and world recession without affecting
the reserves. From (11a) the extent of a viable depreciation is easily
obtained as:
23 12
1
dx* [β dz βdW ]
ββ
= ⋅−
+ (12)


27
(iii) Foreign debt forgiveness: Another way to keep the system in the
initial equilibrium X0 would be to have foreign debt liabilities cut to such
an extent dF<0 as to compensate for the adverse effect of both world
recession (−dW ) and hostile devaluation (dz). Though proposed in the
beginning of 1932, the option was never seriously considered, as such a
mechanism did not exist in the institutional setting of the 1930s and
every country was left to defend its position unilaterally. In the
hypothetical case that debt forgiveness were applied, its extent19 should
be such that (11a) remained intact despite of the external shocks, i.e.
23
1
dF* [ dz dW ]
rββ
σ
=− ⋅ ⋅ − ⋅
+ (13)
A comparison of expressions (12) and (13) with the actual depreciation
and debt repudiation that took place in 1932 can be made by setting
plausible parameter values as illustrated in Appendix B.
5. Conclusions
In the 1930s, Greek economic policy was trying to restructure parochial
relations in key sectors ranging from banking to agriculture, to build
productive infrastructure in order to close the gap of regional
inequalities, and at the same time to become an equal partner in
shaping European politics. Joining the club of the Gold Exchange
19 To obtain a meaningful result, variables in equations (6) and (11a) should be expressed as proportion to GDP with (r+σ) replaced by (r+σ-n), where (n) is the nominal growth rate. However, this would not much affect expression (13) as inflation at that time was running at -0.70% and growth stagnated, so that practically n ≈ 0.


28
Standard seemed to be a political and financial ‘zeitgeist’, and Greece
rightly vowed to participate.
In spite of persistent and well-intentioned domestic policies, the
outcome of the project was negative. The reasons are not due to any
historical predicament of inescapable failure, but to a number of specific
mistakes and policy debacles, such as the following:
i. The choice of fixing the exchange rate to another country’s currency,
with which Greek trade was limited, made the Drachma
uncompetitive towards other economies and soon after the country
experienced large external deficits. As a result, foreign debt had to
remain in relatively high levels despite the lower servicing costs, both
in order to finance external deficits and also to accumulate foreign
reserves.
ii. Greek authorities had a rare opportunity to correct the misguided
exchange rate by following the Bank of England in the steep
devaluation of the pound in 1931. Given that Greece had organized all
of its monetary structures as a faithful follower to the British policy,
the move not only would have been completely justified on economic
grounds but also utterly defensible from the point of view of
international obligations.
iii. Domestic policy targets for creating a dynamic business sector and
generating employment were eventually hindered by the stringency
of credit availability. With the Government at the same time pursuing
a tough fiscal policy, the economy was soon trapped in recession and
this further undermined business prospects and employment.


29
iv. The Government never fully endorsed the principle that the Central
Bank should be institutionally separated from commercial banking
activities. The nascent authority was neither granted full
independence from the Government, nor avoided mixing up with
lending policies and concerns, even when critical decisions should
have been taken in utter confidentiality. The ‘amalgamation’ with
commercial practices caused confusion about its true preferences and
undermined effectiveness in conducting the monetary policy.
v. The external environment was not conducive in the 1930s, as
European nations were lacking institutional coordination and
mechanisms of credit facilitation to stressed countries. In the event of
the crisis, every member of the system was left alone and soon was it
succumbing to the growing pressure. Especially after the Bank of
England abandoned GES, there was a fire-sale of sterling reserves and
this led to a great scarcity of credit availability. No nation was eager to
undertake part of Greek foreign liabilities, and it was even impossible
for the Government to borrow even at the prevailing rates. To avoid
the same omissions, a crucial component of the post-war system was
the emergency finance mechanism to assist economies in a credit
crunch.
Counting on the above arguments, it seems that at no point of time was
there anything fatalistic about the course of events. Rather than seeing
Greece as inescapably succumbing to adversities, it is clear that several
consequences could have been mitigated or avoided under a different
decision-making process. Episodes are not repeated in history, and this
applies equally to successes as well as to failures. Greece today is not


30
doomed by the crisis in the 1930s, given of course that policy failures are
well understood both by current Greek authorities and their partners in
the Eurozone.
To counter fatalistic clichés, it is perhaps useful to draw a parallel on
another Gold-related episode from antiquity, where Greeks were more
successful than in the 1930s. After a well-planned campaign, ancient
Greeks managed to acquire back the Golden Fleece that was seized by a
foreign power. The King of Colchis agreed to hand it over, conditional on
Jason performing three tasks: first, to yoke some fire-breathing oxen and
use them to plough a field sowing dragon-teeth; second, to defeat an
army of warriors sprouting out of the field of dragon-teeth; last, to
subjugate the dragon. With the help of the Gods, Jason succeeded in all
tasks, killing the dragon in his sleep. If one takes the fire-breathing oxen
to symbolize the speculators under the currency peg and the teeth to be
the external deficits sprouting the army of unemployment in the 1930s,
then international markets should be the dragon, alas not quite in
dormant. And, unlike Jason, Greece was left alone and could not
adequately cope with the challenge. Greece today relies on the
assistance of the international financial system and its Eurozone
partners to help put the dragon under control. Given of course that the
final move will still have to be by Jason himself, and Greece should by all
means strive to put the house in order.

The steady-state conditions (Q 0 and x 0

The two loci are shown in Figure 11. From (15a) and (15b), it is easy to show
that the equilibrium (x*, Q*) at point (E0) is reached only on the specific
saddle-path P0P0.
For a unique equilibrium to exist the determinant of the transition matrix in
(14) should be negative or, equivalently in graphical terms, the slope of
exchange rate locus should algebraically exceed that of the reserves locus, i.e.

If θ is insufficient (θ < θMIN) then the system is not saddle-path stable and the
only possible outcome is the regime immediately collapsing and going to a new
equilibrium at (E1).
Calibration:
It is interesting to see under which parameter values expressions (12) and (13)
give the extent of devaluation and debt forgiveness that actually have taken
place after the collapse. One year after abandoning the GES, the Drachma
reached the level of X1 = 108 Drs per US dollar, and this is taken to imply that a
depreciation by 40%, i.e. dx*=0.40, would have led to a sustainable rate.


40
Similarly, the actual repudiation of bond values imposed by the Bank of Greece
in 1932 was up to 70%, and this is taken to imply that a debt forgiveness of
dF* = −0.70 would suffice to calm the pressure during the crisis.
Since in 1931 the British pound was devalued by 35% and world trade was
contracted by 25% relative to 1929, the shocks are set equal to dz = 0.35 and
dW = −0.25 respectively. Finally, the British yield was at that time r=0.05 and
σ=0.07 as in the linear fit in Figure 10. Substituting in (12) and (13), parameter
values have to satisfy
β1 + β2 ≈ 0.25 (18a)
23
0.35β + 0.25β ≈ 0.084 (18b)
For an illustration, one can set β3 = 0.20 and from the above expressions
obtain 1 2
β = 0.15, β = 0.10 which look quite plausible as net export elasticities
of Drachma exchange rates to the US and UK currencies respectively.
Three-dimensional dynamics:
In complete form, expression (10) implies in continuous time the dynamics of
spreads:
01 2 3
s = α +α s −α Q −α Q (19)
The resulting system is now three-dimensional in [ Q x s] , and using (6) and
(8) the transition matrix is obtained as:

For a unique saddle-path solution to exist, there must be two negative and one
positive characteristic roots. The determinant should be positive and a
sufficient condition for the existence of at least one negative root is that the
trace of the above matrix is negative. After some trivial manipulations, the two
conditions lead to a minimum of capital controls:

For 0 1 2 3
α =σ, α = −1, α =η, α = 0 , expression (10) is simplified to (9) and
condition (21) collapses to (17).
