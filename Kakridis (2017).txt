ES V From the background to the foreground, 1927-32 in a word, the Interwar period was a period of violent adjustment and transformation, social and economic, the political instability that distinguished it was an inevitable consequence of this violence. In order to achieve this transformation, Greece needed capital, and a lot of it. After a decade of wars, public finances were far from prosperous. The arrival of refugees had further burdened government expenditure, at the same time that revenues – despite a significant increase in taxation – were struggling to balance budgets. Successive deficits were usually covered by internal borrowing: the state borrowed from the National Bank, which in turn increased the circulation of paper money. Fiscal cachexia was turning into monetary instability: unable to raise sufficient resources, the state &quot;taxed&quot; citizens through inflation. Between 1920 and 1927, prices even quintupled as inflation, in other words, ran at an annual rate of over 25% (see Figure 3.1). Alternatives inside were limited. The need to resort – and indeed twice – to tricks such as the splitting of banknotes, showed the reluctance of Greek citizens to entrust their savings to the State – at least of their own free will! The solution was obvious: Greece had to borrow funds from abroad. But who would be willing to buy Greek bonds? Thanks mainly to the suffocating institutional framework of the International Economic Commission (IECO), which has been active in Greece since 1898, the country regularly serviced its foreign debt. However, the fiscal deficit and currency instability did not leave much room for optimism, while the backlog created by the reparations and debts to the allies made it difficult to draw resources from abroad. The only exception was the refugee loan, which had been issued with the support of the League of Nations in 1924. Even this, however, was accompanied by high interest rates and a strict framework of supervision by the Rehabilitation Committee 5 The forced internal loans of 1922 and 1926 arose from the reduction of the nominal value of all banknotes by 50% and 25%, respectively, and the simultaneous conversion of the balance into twenty-year government bonds. The funds of the second forced loan were used to pay the interest on National Defense bonds, the only credit securities that could be issued before the stabilization. 49 50 Kyriakos Varvaresos: Biography as economic history 150% 125% 100% 75% 50% 25% 0% -25% Chart 3.1 From the disaster to (Fiscal and monetary figures, 1920-1928) 1922 1921 1923 Money supply (change %) - General price index (% change) stabilization 1920 1925 1926 1927 1924 Government deficit as % of GDP -- Sterling exchange rate3 (% change ) 1928 1 Banknote circulation and demand deposits. 2.

Therefore, fiscal and monetary consolidation were the necessary conditions to restore the country&#39;s access to international capital markets and to finance productive projects. These were the conditions faced by the universal government that emerged from the overthrow of the Pangalos dictatorship and the November elections. of 1926 – the first after a long period of political disorder.

After all, the Asia Minor Catastrophe had reduced the distance between the two traditional camps, whose ideological differences were smaller than the intensity of the conflicts between them, which mainly concerned the administration of power and the control of the state machinery, would suggest and the army. Securing a new foreign loan was a key priority of the new government, which first rushed to settle the war debts. In the autumn of 1926, negotiations with England were resumed, which were concluded a few months later, followed by similar agreements with the United States and France, thus removing the legal obstacles that prevented the issuance of Greek bonds on international markets. The trust of foreign investors had to be won. A decisive role would be played by the attitude of the Fiscal Committee of the League of Nations, whose support the Greek side was ardently seeking. The message from Geneva was clear: Greece needed to house its public finances and stabilize the drachma. 9 In December 1926, the Minister of Finance and successor of Venizelos in the leadership of the Liberal Party, Georgios Kafantaris, commissioned a committee of experts to suggest appropriate measures for stabilization. The committee, in which Var7 participated The ecumenical government resulted from the cooperation of two Venezuelan and two anti-Venezilian parties, under the presidency of the ultra-party personality of Al. Zaimi: the term &quot;ecumenical&quot; was somewhat misleading, especially since both the Laiki of Panagis Tsaldaris and the Democratic Union of Alexandros Papanastasi gradually moved away from the government. The core of the governments remained the Liberal Party throughout, led by Georgios Kafantaris, who had also taken over the difficult portfolio of the economy. For the political developments of the period, see Dafni (1997 [1974]), Mavrogordatos (1983: 25-54) and Mazower (1991: 19-37). 8 These were negotiations that had started since 1924, in which both Alexandros Diomedis and Emmanuel Tsouderos had participated. In October 1926, the Kondylis government assigned Eleftherios Venizelos to contact the British for the final settlement of the issue . The final agreement was signed on April 9, 1927. Although it had been secured since the beginning of 1928, the agreement with the USA was ratified on November 8, 1928. The negotiations with the French, which were concluded in December 1928, proved more difficult (Pantelakis, 1988: 200ff; Dritsa, 2012: 1184). 9 Similar were the admonitions of the Bank of England and the International Economic Commission that had been formulated already in the middle of 1926; see Pepelasis-Minoglou (1996).

Inflation had been accompanied by a ramp to deal with the monetary problem, a gradual devaluation of the national currency, which was now below its pre-war value (see Chart 3.1). According to them, monetary consolidation did not simply mean stabilizing and taming inflation; above all, it meant &quot;locking&quot; the exchange rate and tying the drachma to the gold chariot.

These discrepancies, which were also pointed out by Kyriakos Varvaresos in his university lectures, contributed to the final collapse of the rule of Vl.

For the members of the &quot;economic consolidation&quot; committee, it was now the drachma&#39;s turn: in order for Greece to borrow abroad, the national currency had to be pegged to gold or to some stable currency, such as sterling and the dollar. 3 The recommendations of the experts appointed by the Fiscal Committee of the League of Nations, who visited Greece in the spring of 1927, moved on the same wavelength.14 However, their observations on the role of the National Bank proved to be critical. In particular, the members of the committee criticized the relations of National Bank with the State, at the same time criticizing the fact that the publishing privilege was in the hands of a commercial bank. Modern practice dictated the assignment of monetary policy to an independent institution, capable of acting as a supporter of the entire banking system and resisting political pressures.15 Thus, the stabilization of the Greek economy was linked to the transformation of the National Bank into a purely issuing institution. 53 Lacking substantial alternatives, the Greek side was forced to accept the terms of the League of Nations, hoping to be able to delay banking reform. When this reform turned out to be non-negotiable, National strongly refused to suspend its commercial activities. At the same time, the government viewed with suspicion the possibility of weakening the country&#39;s largest credit institution. The negotiations appeared to be deadlocked. The solution was given by the Deputy Governor of the National Bank, Emmanuel Tsouderos, by proposing the establishment of a new bank, in which the National Bank 13 Depending on whether a country was linked directly to gold or through another currency (which was convertible into gold), it would adhere to the rule of gold or the gold exchange standard; the difference, though not negligible, was rather technical and will not concern us further. After all, regional countries like Greece had strong incentives to adopt the gold standard. 14 This is the famous commission under Joseph Avenol, in which three other members of the secretariat of the League of Nations participated. The Greek government, which was anything but excited by the prospect of the visit, was forced to retreat after it became clear that the evaluation by the Fiscal Committee was necessary to secure an external loan (see Kosti, 2003: 272ff and Pyrso, 1936: 28ff ). 15 This was the recipe that had been followed in the establishment of various central banks during the interwar period, often under the auspices of the League of Nations (Singleton, 2010 : 50ff ). hes, Stuttgart, -51, London: hy, London: lete Record re: Seaforth rungspolitervention. greements: 391-404. -ibner. e Interwar d Transit ed Coundon Press. imanities of 1941enhagen: ning out) 1-223. ed World ty Press. e Eve of z Smith enhagen: beration ed PhD Bibliography von Pelt, Mogens (1998), Tobacco, Arms and Politics: Greece and Germany from WorldCrisis to World War, 1929-41, Copenhagen: Museum Tusculanum Press.

For this reason, moreover, the evolution of the gross domestic product per capita, an indicator of the overall course of the &quot;national economy&quot;, does not seem to keep pace with the evolution of the movement of the macro-scales of the agricultural economy. At the time of the greatest crisis of the last one (during the period of the chronic raisin crisis of the years 1893-1910) the Greek economy, i.e. mainly the non-agricultural sectors, recorded very rapid positive rates of change, combined with the improvement of the domestic financial environment (return to par after the Treasury bankruptcy and the devaluation of banknotes), the transfers of immigrants and shipping, but especially the overall global development of the Belle Epoque era. The rapid growth of the GDP (the reconstruction of which we owe to a very large extent to the tireless persistence of Giorgos Kostelenos) and the improvement of all indicators do not seem to be affected by the compression of agricultural incomes, especially of the populations that migrate and come from smallholder households of self-sufficient inland agriculture. The development of the secondary and tertiary sector in the cities does not seem to be directly linked to the course of agricultural sizes. Indeed, the first and second waves of industrialization of the Greek economy are not phenomena that can be interpreted exclusively from an endogenous dynamic and studied in isolation from international developments. They are processes that go hand in hand with similar movements in the wider Eastern-Mediterranean area (the Ottoman Empire and Mediterranean Europe). The creation, in ports or coastal zones, of small urban industrial enclaves that feed the domestic and regional demand of cities and commodity agriculture zones is associated with the readjustment of the international division of labor, the displacement of industries with the lowest added value (and therefore of the less profitable and dynamic) closer to the financial district, or their markets. This is of course not a neutral process and without risks and opportunities. During this phase of the development of the world economy, when new technologically innovative industries, with the highest added value and great need for invested capital, are created and new hierarchies are imposed on the global industrial web, it is possible for countries with comparative advantages in raw materials or in human capital (expertise, disciplined, i.e. trained, labor force) to penetrate the narrow fireof medicine of Greece 1914-1940a collaborated with him for the timeless development of the Greek raia xovia nxiola.
