ABSTRACT
The establishment of a fully fledged central bank in Greece between May 1927 and May 1928 was a prerequisite for the country’s stabilisation programme prepared by the Financial Committee of the League of Nations. Prior to 1928, the National Bank of Greece had acted as a central bank whilst at the same time being by far the biggest and most powerful commercial bank in the country. Under pressure from the League, its governors faced the challenge of transforming it into a fully fledged central bank by shedding all business that was in the province of deposit and commercial banking. They chose instead for the Bank to retain its commercial activities and instead a new fully fledged central bank was established. This thesis explores both the central banking and commercial aspects of the National Bank from the enactment of the Law of Control in 1898 until de jure stabilisation in 1928. It addresses the following questions: why was the National Bank not in a position to transform itself into a fully fledged central bank on its own initiative following a path similar to that described by the natural evolution hypothesis? Why were the commercial activities of the National Bank so important that in the end it chose to retain that aspect of its business when prior to 1927 it had so fiercely guarded its central banking privileges? It is argued that it was the way in which the governors of the National Bank combined central banking responsibilities with commercial banking that safeguarded and preserved the financial strength and consequently the reputation of the Bank throughout its entire history as a bank of issue. The financial position of the dual-purpose Bank was also protected by the conservative and risk-averse way in which it pursued its commercial activities. The National Bank’s financial strength was based on its market power and its ability to select high quality assets and liabilities which resulted in its enduring profitability and solvency. The quality of its assets and liabilities was more important for its governors than maximisation of profits per se. The way that central banking reforms were implemented is also studied. The objectives and functions of the new central bank are evaluated as well as its financial position when it first opened its doors for business. It is maintained that the statutes of the Bank of Greece were at the heart of the central banking principles promoted by the Bank of England and were focused on the macro function of a central bank and on its role as the bank of the government. This thesis also sheds light on the complex relationship that arose between Greek governments and foreign supervisors between the enactment of the Law of Control in 1898 and stabilisation in 1928. Furthermore, it asks questions about the conditionality attached to bailout loans in the late nineteenth century and in the 1920s. The impact that international financial intervention had on monetary reforms is clearly demonstrated. It is argued that monetary developments in Greece between 1898 and 1928 reflect the political economy of the time as well as the historical circumstances. Monetary reforms were shaped by the objectives of the National Bank and the constraints under which it operated rather than foreign control. These findings provide valuable insights into why Greek governments have unsuccessfully struggled to implement widespread structural reforms demanded by their lenders since 2010 and as a consequence the country has experienced a deep and protracted economic recession.

And if you find her poor, Ithaca won’t have fooled you. Wise as you will have become, so full of experience, you’ll have understood by then what these Ithacas mean.

George B. Dertilis introduced me to economic history when I was an undergraduate in the
Department of Economics at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. His lectures
created a stimulating intellectual environment where animated discussions took place and
usually continued outside the classroom, proving conducive to friendships that have endured
the test of time and distance. Nikolaos Petralias encouraged me to embark on postgraduate
studies in Economic History when I was still an undergraduate student. During his lectures, I
had the opportunity to express openly my intellectual curiosity and indeed fascination with
the interwar period. At the time, whilst researching the causes and consequences of the Great
Depression, it never occurred to me that, in my life time, the Greek economy would
experience a 25 per cent collapse in GDP with far reaching social consequences; an
exceptional economic collapse that has taken aback an otherwise ‘happy’ and unprepared
country, lowering living standards and leaving only bleak expectations for the future.
London School of Economics provided a stimulating intellectual academic environment for
my postgraduate studies: a unique, multicultural, social science institution that, beyond its
academic credentials and openness, encourages acceptance and celebration of difference,
sending an important message to a world that inclines towards erecting walls, possibly ‘to
avert [its] eyes from the shadow’1. At the Economic History Department I was fortunate to
enjoy the supervision of William P. Kennedy and Nicholas F. R. Crafts, and the unfailing
support of Max-Stephan Schulze who assumed supervisory responsibilities during the final
stages of this thesis. They all provided advice, guidance, encouragement and constructive
suggestions that made working with them a great privilege. Jagjit Chadha and Ioanna Sapfo
Pepelasis served as rigorous examiners and provided constructive comments during the viva
examination on 30 September 1916. Discussions with colleagues at the Economic History
Department enriched my research and boosted my dedication to this project. Linda Sampson
provided generous support, which often extended beyond her administrative duties.
Earlier versions of a number of chapters were presented at various seminars, workshops and
conferences where the audience and discussants provided valuable feedback. The staff of the
numerous archives and libraries I visited for the purpose of this research, generously offered
their expertise. In particular Phyllida Melling, librarian at Guildhall Library, recommended

The Bank of Greece financed the initial steps of this research and a scholarship from the State

was made possible by a grant from the Irwin Trust of the Central Research Fund of the
University of London and the Economic History Society financed my participation in several of
its annual conferences.
I am fortunate to have attended and enjoyed the support of all these institutions and
individuals. I express my profound gratitude and appreciation to all institutions and
individuals who have supported and encouraged me through this long journey. I would not,
however, have reached its conclusion without my family’s unwavering faith in me and their
patience with my ventures into monetary history and the world of central banking. This thesis
is dedicated to all of them.

INTRODUCTION
The establishment of a fully fledged central bank in Greece between May 1927 and May 1928
was a prerequisite of the country’s stabilisation programme prepared by the Financial
Committee of the League of Nations.
The Greek authorities resorted to the League of Nations for a second time, in the spring
of 1927 in order to obtain an international loan under its auspices to stabilise the drachma and to
continue work with refugees. The reconstruction scheme prepared by the Financial Committee
was a typical League stabilisation plan, comprising institutional reforms focused mainly on the
central banking system and the flotation of an international loan. In the Greek example,
however, there was a domestic variation on the League’s norms in that reorganisation of the
issuing bank in Greece as recommended by the Financial Committee led to the establishment of
a fully fledged central bank de novo which opened its doors for business on Monday, 14 May
1928, two days after the drachma had been de jure stabilised.
Prior to that date, the National Bank of Greece, a joint stock bank founded in 1841,
had acted as a central bank whilst at the same time being by far the biggest and most powerful
commercial bank in the country. In April 1927, League representatives visited Athens to
investigate economic conditions in the country. The multifaceted character of the National
Bank attracted severe criticism from the League officials, its activities as a commercial bank
deemed to be in stark contrast to those of an orthodox central bank. Furthermore, the National
Bank, being the country’s central bank, was considered to be too close to the government. The
following June, the Greek government officially requested the assistance of the League of
Nations to obtain an international loan under its auspices. The Financial Committee asked as a
prerequisite for the National Bank to be reformed so as to bring it into closer conformity with
modern central banking practice by shedding all business that would normally be the province
of deposit and commercial banking. Strong opposition was expressed by the governor of the
National Bank who was prepared to espouse only marginal reforms of the business that the
Bank pursued. The negotiations were about to reach a stalemate in late June 1927 when the
deputy governor of the National Bank suggested an alternative solution which at the time
appeared innovative: the National Bank would continue its commercial functions and instead
it would transfer to a new bank its privilege of note issue and those of its other activities that
would normally be carried on by a central bank. This proposition led to the establishment of a
fully fledged central bank in Greece, the Bank of Greece.
17


This thesis explores the ‘dual position’2, i.e. both the central banking and commercial
aspects of the National Bank from the enactment of the Law of Control in 1898 until de jure
stabilisation in 1928. It addresses the following questions: why was the National Bank not in a
position to transform itself into a fully fledged central bank on its own initiative following a
path similar to that described by the natural evolution hypothesis? Why were the commercial
activities of the National Bank so important that in the end it chose to retain that aspect of its
business when prior to 1927 it had so fiercely guarded its issuing privilege?
The relationship between the National Bank and the government is scrutinised. The
way that the government financed wars and reconstruction is also examined. The aim is to
evaluate the way that public finance between 1912 and 1927 affected the financial position of
the Old Bank. This naturally leads to the question of the kind of stabilisation programme that
the governors of the National Bank favoured and how they envisaged it affecting its position.
What did the National Bank try to achieve with stabilisation? How did its governor envisage
that stabilisation would affect the status of the Bank? The National Bank pursued the
implementation of a stabilisation plan accompanied by an international loan in order to
liquidate part of the government debt tied to its assets. This would improve the financial
position of the National Bank and enable it to expand its commercial business and take
advantage of the new opportunities that a stable drachma and capital inflows would create.
The way that central banking reforms were implemented is studied. The objectives
and the functions of the new central bank are evaluated as well as its financial position when
it first opened its doors for business. Public debt held by the Old Bank even after having lost
its central banking functions is also examined.
This thesis also sheds light on the complex relationship that arose between Greek
governments and foreign supervisors between the enactment of the Law of Control in 1898
and stabilisation in 1928. Sovereign risk time series have been constructed to establish the
background of the negotiating power of the Greek government on the international financial
markets during the period in question. Furthermore, this thesis asks questions about
government access to capital markets with assistance and support during the first era of
globalisation and under the auspices of the League of Nations in the 1920s. It also examines
the conditionality attached to this kind of borrowing operation.

Chapter 1 discusses the historiography on central banking and looks at the different
theories that have been developed to explain the evolution as well as the spread of the
institution up to the advent of the Great Depression. Special attention is paid to the role that
the Bank of England and the League of Nations played in promoting central banking
orthodoxy in the 1920s. Chapter 2 discusses Greek historiography on the establishment of
the central bank in Greece and sets the objectives of this thesis. It also presents the sources
employed. Chapters 3 and 4 focus on the predecessor of the Bank of Greece, the National
Bank, and explore its ‘dual position’ as a central bank and at the same time the most
important commercial bank in the country. The monetary arrangement of March 1910 that has
prompted contemporary economists and economic historians to claim that Greece adopted
either the gold standard or the gold exchange standard during that month is studied in Chapter
4. The evolution of public debt and the sources of government borrowing from the outbreak
of the First World War until de jure stabilisation of the drachma are examined in Chapter 5.
Chapter 6 analyses the different plans proposed for the stabilisation of the drachma and the
League reconstruction scheme is scrutinised. This chapter also examines the making of the
Stabilisation Loan. Finally, the parallels and contrasts between the Law of Control of 1898
and the League Stabilisation Plan of 1928 are explored. Chapter 7 looks at the institutional
arrangements surrounding the establishment of the Bank of Greece. Its aims and functions are
presented along with its endowment. Chapter 7 is followed by the overall conclusions of this
research.

1.1.1. Origins and evolution of central banking
Walter Bagehot, writing in the nineteenth century, and Vera Smith, in the mid-1930s, despite
being supporters of free banking, argued in favour of central banking in their influential
books.3 Today nearly all independent countries have established a central bank whilst the
influence and the scope of the alternative to central banking, that is to say free banking, has
remained purely academic.
The origins of central banking are usually traced to the second half of the nineteenth
century, with the Bank Charter Act of 1844 being a watershed. The monetary debate in
London that followed the enactment of Peel’s Act, mainly prompted by Bagehot, led to the
evolution of central banking as it is known today.4 Some scholars have maintained that central
banking emerged earlier during the Suspension period between 1797 and 1821 when the
Bullionist debate took place.5 Both approaches, however, suggest that the ‘home of central

banking’ is England.6 In addition, they show that the evolution of the Bank of England from
being a dual-purpose bank – that is to say, a bank that combined central banking
responsibilities with commercial activities – to being a non-competitive, non-profit
maximising banking organisation which focused primarily on public duties provides the
historical archetype for the development of a central bank. In fact, the dominant view of the
evolution of central banking has been based on the history of the Bank of England.
Recent research, however, attempts to challenge the ‘British orthodoxy’ and traces
the origins of modern central banks to the early seventeenth century. It focuses on the history
of public deposit banks – giro banks – such as the Bank of Amsterdam and the Bank of
Hamburg and argues that these banks functioned as early precursors of modern central banks
since they managed to maintain a sound currency.7 Stephen Quinn and William Roberds
(2005) go as far as to claim that the Bank of Amsterdam was the ‘first true central bank’.
There is a consensus in the literature on central banking, on the reasons that led to the
establishment of early central banks. Early central banks were founded for political reasons
connected with the exigencies of state finance.8 Their emergence stemmed from the need of
‘revenue seeking or power-hungry governments’9 to ‘finance on beneficial, subsidised terms’10
public expenditure, especially during periods of political turmoil and war. These early central
banks possibly had a monopoly in note issuing and served as the bank of the government. In
addition, they pursued commercial activities and enjoyed privileges endorsed by legislation in
return for financial assistance to the government.
Some nineteenth century central banks were established to unify a chaotic system of
note issue.11 These central banks were also expected to manage and protect the metallic reserves
of the country in question and also to facilitate and improve the payment system. These latter
functions were seen as having widespread beneficial economic consequences. The ability,
however, to share in the profits of seigniorage and the greater centralised control over the gold
reserves had obvious political attractions.12

Michael Bordo and Angela Redish (1987) examine the possibility that the Bank of
Canada, founded in 1935, was established as an anchor in the absence of a gold standard
whilst scholars who have examined the establishment of central banks after the end of the
Second World War have argued that by then, it had become accepted that any self-respecting
independent country should have its own central bank.13 In the newly established countries,
especially those countries which were previously colonies and became independent after the
Second World War, to have a central bank was synonymous with political and economic
independence.14 As they achieved political independence, one of their first major acts was
typically to create a central bank. For the first time, these countries achieved both the political
sovereignty and the institutional arrangements that would enable them to implement
independent monetary policies.15
There has been a debate over whether the evolution of central banking relied entirely
on market forces or required deliberate state action.16 This debate is focused primarily on the
role of a central bank as the bank of the banks. Proponents of the free banking school argue,
usually emphatically, that it was in the monopoly of note issue and other government
privileges that led early central banks to assume responsibility for the stability of the financial
sector. For example, Smith (1936, p. 168) argued that ‘[i]t was out of monopolies in the note
issue that were derived the secondary functions and characteristics of our modern central
banks’.17 She identified as ‘secondary functions’ of a central bank its role as a bankers’ bank
and the power to exercise control over the credit market – a form of monetary policy.
Therefore, according to Smith the monopoly in note issuing – a government granted privilege
– is the essential attribute that defines a central bank and not any of the ‘secondary functions’.
In this case then, the emergence of a central bank is a product of ‘government sponsorship’.18
In 1873 Bagehot stated that the government-granted privileges of the Bank of
England played a crucial part in its gaining the deposits of other banks.19 He concluded that
with so many advantages over all competitors, it is quite natural that the Bank of England should have far outstripped them all. Inevitably, it became the bank in London: all the other bankers grouped themselves round it, and lodged their [gold] reserve with it. Thus, [the] one-reserve system was not deliberately founded upon definite reasons; it was the

gradual consequence of many singular events, and of an accumulation of legal privileges
on a single bank which has not been altered and which no one would now defend.20
More recently Charles Goodhart (1988), drawing on the historical experiences of
several nations, demonstrated that early central banks gained their role as a bank of the banks
in the way Bagehot described. Goodhart argued that
[o]nce such Central Banks had been established, however, their central position within the system, their ‘political’ power as the government’s bank, their command (usually) over the bulk of the nation’s metallic reserve, and, most important, their ability to provide extra cash, notes by rediscounting made them become the bankers’ bank: commercial banks would not only hold a large proportion of their own (cash) reserves as balances
with the Central Bank, but also rely on it to provide extra liquidity when in difficulties. 21
Hence, according to Goodhart, market forces are responsible for the evolution of central
banks as banks of the banks, and for assuming responsibility for the stability of the financial
sector. He further added that ‘in most cases of central banks founded in the nineteenth century,
the full ramifications of their role as bankers’ bank were only dimly perceived at the time of
their founding; these functions developed naturally from the context of relationships within the
system’.22
Goodhart’s views on the evolution of central banking are known as the natural
evolution hypothesis. In a nutshell, it is argued that central banking as it is known today
emerged when private, profit-making commercial banks which also enjoyed government
sponsored privileges evolved into non-profit, non-competitive public institutions whose main
concern was the stability of the financial sector. The conflict between the public responsibilities
of a dual-purpose bank and concerns over satisfying shareholders made the transition from a
competitive, profit-maximising bank to a modern central bank lengthy and painful.23 Thus, the
defining characteristic of a central bank according to the natural evolution hypothesis is the
function of the lender of last resort.24 Monetary policy played a minor role in this evolution.25
It is beyond doubt that acceptance of the microeconomic responsibility for the stability of the
financial sector was a defining attribute in the evolution of central banking as it is known
today. However, as Marc Flandreau (2008, p. 213, n. 2) remarks, Goodhart’s account relied
heavily on case studies prepared for the US Congress National Commission of 1908, which had
an explicit mandate to examine whether a central bank was able to reduce the occurrence and
severity of financial crises.

Central banking as it is recognised today is the product of a slow process, trial and
perhaps historical accident. From the establishment of the Riksbank which is often regarded
as the oldest surviving central bank, to the outbreak of the Great War is a long period of
consolidation for the institution. By the turn of the twentieth century, central banking, either
by market forces as Goodhart argues or according to Smith by government intervention, had
developed its main characteristics and functions. Central banks were regarded as having a
monopoly – either partial or complete – in note issuing, and as being banks of the government
as well as banks of the banks. By that time ideally, central banking institutions had shed
commercial activities and shareholders’ interests were subordinate to their public duties.
Otherwise, they ‘were thought of as historical oddities to be brought into line, sooner or later,
with the English mode’.26

used to compile this table. Table 1.1 shows that there were 18 central banks by the turn of the
twentieth century, though they were by no means homogenous. This table also demonstrates
that the number of central banks being established increased rapidly decade by decade,

25


particularly after the Second World War. Today, almost all independent countries have a
central bank.
Capie et al. (1994, pp. 5–6) provided a detailed chronology of the evolution of the
fully fledged model of the institution such as had been adopted by 14 of the 18 banking
organisations that Table 1.1 indicates had operated as central banks by the end of the
nineteenth century. With the exception of the Bank of Japan, each of them was a European
bank that had evolved into a fully fledged central bank as the term is understood today. Capie
et al. (1994, p. 5) used a functional definition to identify a banking organisation as being a
central bank. They recognised a banking organisation as a central bank if it had a note issuing
monopoly, was the bank of the government and had assumed the role of the lender of last
resort.27
A common characteristic of these 18 banking institutions that are thought of as
having been central banks since the nineteenth century is that they still survive today. With
the exception of the Sveriges Riksbank, these were privately owned banks engaged in
commercial activities whilst at the same time enjoying public privileges; they had a note
issuing monopoly and had been the bank of the government since their foundation. In
addition, the development of all these banks into central banks in the modern sense of the
term complied with one of Goodhart’s laws: their public responsibilities were eclipsing their
commercial activities by the end of the nineteenth century. That is to say, their metamorphosis
from banks of issue into fully fledged central banks followed a path described by the natural
evolution hypothesis. By contrast, all organisations that operate as central banks now and
which were established after the turn of the twentieth century began life as fully fledged
central banks which had a mandate to be the sole bank of issue, the bank of the government
and possibly to be responsible for the stability of the banking sector. This demonstrates that
the development of central banking in most countries differed from that described by the
natural evolution hypothesis. Nearly all the central banks that operate today were established
from the beginning as central banks and were endowed with the latest central banking
principles, powers and techniques, which were frequently in contrast with central banking
practices in the country in question.
By the turn of the twentieth century, however, there were other banking organisations
not recognised in Table 1.1 which, although they had central banking responsibilities, failed
to evolve into the fully blown version of the institution as it became known after the mid
27 See Ugolini (2011, pp. 2–8) for a presentation of the functional and institutional approaches to central banking.
26


twentieth century. In some cases, these organisations were not encouraged either by market
forces or further government intervention to evolve into central banks in the modern sense of
the term, whilst in others historical circumstances did not permit their survival.
One of the early central banks that did not develop into the fully fledged mode of the
institution was the National Bank of Greece, which was established in 1842. In 1927, it was
regarded as ‘one of the oldest banks of issue’,28 and if it had continued to pursue central
banking activities from then on, then the origins of central banking in Greece would be
traceable back to the mid-nineteenth century. This would have been possible if in the first
instance the National Bank had confined its activities to central banking responsibilities and
had shed the commercial business that was not compatible with orthodox central banking as
defined by the Financial Committee of the League of Nations in June 1927. The National
Bank chose to retain its commercial aspect, however, and so instead a new central bank, the
Bank of Greece, was established. Continuity in central banking in Greece from the mid
nineteenth century until today might yet have been maintained if in 1928, the newly
established central bank had taken over the name of the Old Bank becoming the ‘National
Bank of Greece’ as a member of the League committee responsible for the reform had
recommended privately. This was never officially proposed, however, as the governors of the
Old Bank of issue in Greece would never have consented.29
Table 1.1 therefore demonstrates firstly the number of early central banks that had
evolved into the fully fledged model of the institution by 1900 following a path described by
the natural evolution hypothesis, and secondly that once the idea of central banking had been
consolidated then the norm became the establishment of central banks de novo. A question
occurs, however: why did so many countries establish a central bank de novo even though
there was already in place some kind of monetary authority that was pursuing central banking
functions? It is, therefore, important to look at the reasons that prevented early central banks
from developing into fully fledged models of the institution. In this way, further light will be
shed on the evolution of central banking as well as the way in which the institution spread.
This thesis aspires to provide insights into the matter in question by examining the evolution
of central banking in Greece between the enactment of the Law of Control in 1898 and the
establishment of the Bank of Greece in 1928.

1.1.3. In search of a definition of central banking
The natural evolution hypothesis provides a convincing explanation of the development of
central banking as it is known today. However, it neither explains why the British ‘orthodoxy’
became the dominant dogma and was adopted by the rest of the world nor sheds any light on
the way in which it spread.
A question asked in the literature is ‘what makes an institution a central bank’.30 This
question becomes even more pertinent when it is related to historical research on central
banking. Capie et al. (1994, p. 5) remark that to define ‘central banking is problematic’.
Whilst Lawrence White (1999, p. 71) notes that there is a ‘surprising lack of consensus on the
question’ and states that economists identify central banking with at least five major roles,
adding that it is not necessary for a central bank to have adopted all these roles – it suffices ‘to
play one or more of these roles without playing all five’. These five roles are as follows:
serving as a bankers’ bank, having a monopoly of note issue, acting as a lender of last resort,
regulating commercial banks and conducting monetary policy.31 Goodhart (1988, pp. 5–7)
identifies an institution as a central bank if it is responsible for monetary policy which is a
macroeconomic function, is the bank of the banks, acts as a lender of last resort and is
possibly responsible for banking supervision. The latter are all microeconomic functions. The
European Central Bank also provides an answer to the question of what a central bank is. On
its website it is stated that a ‘central bank is a public institution that manages the
currency of a country or group of countries and controls the money supply – literally,
the amount of money in circulation’.32 A Goodhart assumption is implied in all these
definitions of central banking; a central bank is a non-profit-maximising institution which is
not involved in general commercial banking.
Smith (1936) proposed a definition of central banking which is echoed in the definition
proposed by the European Central Bank without, however, assuming that a central bank is not
involved in commercial activities. In her book published in the mid-1930s, she suggested that
[t]he primary definition of central banking is a banking system in which a single bank has either a complete or a residuary monopoly in the note issue. A residuary monopoly denotes a case where there are a number of note issuers, but all of these except one are working under narrow limitations, and this one authority is responsible for the bulk of the circulation, and is the sole bank possessing that measure of elasticity in its note issue

which gives it the power to exercise control over the total amount of currency and credit
available.33
The question that arises in this thesis is whether the National Bank was a central bank during
the period that it enjoyed the issuing privilege. The National Bank was a dual-purpose bank
which combined the public responsibilities of a central bank with commercial activities. Thus,
if a definition of central banking based on the evolutionary hypothesis is adopted, then the
National Bank does not qualify as a central bank. The National Bank, however, had either a
residuary or a complete monopoly in note issuing, was the bank of the government and to a
limited extent the bank of the banks. Furthermore, it had the financial strength and capacity to
act as a lender of last resort during a period of crisis. What distinguishes the Old Bank of
issue in Greece from its European counterparts is that it did not develop into a fully fledged
central bank as would be recognised today. In this thesis, the National Bank is considered to
be a central bank which nevertheless failed to adopt the British orthodoxy in central banking,
and the aim is to examine the forces that shaped the evolution of central banking in Greece, a
small open economy on the European periphery which had a stable banking system.
1.2. Central banking in the 1920s, the Bank of England and the League of
Nations
1.2.1. Introduction
According to R. S. Sayers (1957, p. 21) ‘[t]he interwar period can perhaps be called the heyday
of central banking. It was certainly the period in which central banking was most widely talked
about’. Central banking was at the heart of discussions that took place in Brussels in 1920 and
nearly two years later at the Genoa conference. Furthermore, central banking reforms were at
the core of all reconstruction schemes prepared by the League of Nations in the 1920s. These
reconstruction programmes aimed at restoring the pre-war status quo in international financial
and monetary relations and echoed the resolutions adopted at the Brussels and Genoa
conferences.
Both at Brussels and Genoa, resolutions were passed, recommending the
establishment of central banks where they did not exist. They also called for central banks to
be insulated from political interference.34 The resolutions passed at both international

financial conferences reflected the ambition of monetary authorities to overcome political
divisions and problems in the international political arena, a legacy of the war, in order to
design the institutional basis for the restoration of the international gold standard to its pre
war status. They also aimed at strengthening the cooperation among central bankers. At
Genoa it was also proposed that the Bank of England would convene a meeting of central
bankers to consider how to give effect to the recommendations adopted by the conference.35
The primary objective of this meeting would be to develop ‘the practice of continuous co
operation among Central Banks of issue, or banks regulating credit policy in the several
countries’.36
The resolutions passed at Genoa echoed the principles of central banking that the then
governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, promoted (more on this later). R. G.
Hawtrey, who worked at the time for the Treasury, is generally regarded as responsible for
framing the resolutions of the Genoa conference on monetary policy and central banking.37
Any discussion of central banking during the 1920s is dominated by reference to
personalities who represented certain ideas and policies that dominated before the outbreak of
the First World War. These international figures who remained national central bankers
attempted to establish the pre-war status quo.38 Indeed, their aim was to set out the
prerequisites and conditions that made the world economy function smoothly during the first
era of globalisation.
1.2.2. Central banking in the 1920s and the Bank of England
Considerations of developments in central banking led the governor of the Bank of England,
Montagu Norman, to draft a paper on ‘Central Banks’ early in 1921. He referred to it as
‘Epitome’ and it is presented in Table 1.2 below. This paper on the nature of central banking
went through several versions and expanded as a result of Norman’s correspondence with
other central bankers and Henry Strakosch who was considered by Norman to be ‘the best
authority on the subject [of] the principles which should govern the policy of central banks in
any country’.39 He had been responsible for the founding of the South African Reserve Bank
and also served as a member of the Financial Committee of the League of Nations from 1920

until 1937. Furthermore, as a member of the League, he was involved in the preparation of the
statutes of the Bank of Greece.
Table 1.2: Montagu Norman’s ‘Epitome’ of central banking
CENTRAL BANKS
A Central Bank should not compete with other Banks for general business. A Central Bank should not take monies at interest on its own account nor accept Bills of Exchange. A Central Bank should have no Branch outside its own country. A Central Bank should not engage in a general Exchange business on its own account with any other country. A Central Bank should be independent but should do all its own Government’s business directly or indirectly – including gold and Currency. A Central Bank should be the Banker of all other Banks in its own country and should assist them to develop its business and economic resources. A Central Bank should protect its own Traders from the rapacity of other banks in its own country. [*] A Central Bank should act as the settling agent for Clearing House balances arising between the Banks of its own country, and to the widest extent practicable. [*] A Central Bank should handle domestic collections for its members and so regulate the domestic exchanges. [*] A Central Bank should have power to examine Banks which come to the Central Bank for credits and assistance. A Central Bank may have an Agency in another country. That Agency should either be in its own name or should be the Central Bank of the other country: in the former case it should do all its Banking and all Kindred business with the Central Bank of the other country. And should co-operate in practice and principle with the Central Bank of the other country. And should receive the most favoured treatment and information from the Central Bank of the other country. And should do the Banking and kindred business of its Principal’s Government in the other country.

All the characteristics, primary functions and responsibilities of central banking as it had
evolved by the 1920s are listed in Montagu Norman’s ‘Epitome’. The governor of the New
York Federal Reserve Bank, Benjamin Strong, added the three points marked with an asterisk.
Norman did not refer to the note issuing monopoly of a central bank as he perhaps took it for
granted. The micro functions of a central bank, that is to say its responsibilities as bank of the
banks and bank of the government, are very well defined. In his ‘Epitome’, Norman clearly
31


envisages a central bank as a bank of the banks and as a bank of the government. He stressed
that although a central bank should be responsible for its own government’s business directly
or indirectly, the central bank should be independent from government interference. He put
considerable effort into defining the relationship of a central bank with its counterparts
abroad, so as to encourage central bank cooperation. Norman also aimed at promoting
exclusive business relations among central banks.
The Comptroller of the Bank of England, Ernest Harvey, was sent to Australia in
1927 to publicise the Bank of England’s ideas on central banking.40 In an address to the
Victorian Branch of the Economic Society of Australia, Harvey referred extensively to the
most important principles of any sound central banking system. He covered the points that
Norman referred to in his ‘Epitome’, but he also complemented them by stating that the
central bank should possess the exclusive note issue right. He emphasised the macroeconomic
function of a central bank and its non-competitive and non-profit-maximising character.
Harvey too, described a central bank as the bank of other banks in the country and stressed
that its assets ‘should be of the most liquid character possible’. As he himself acknowledged,
if the statutes of central banks established in the 1920s are examined, it will be found that
these principles had been incorporated.41 Table 1.3 below lists the main functions and
responsibilities of a central bank according to Ernest Harvey and consequently the Bank of
England.

Table 1.3: Harvey’s ‘Functions of a central bank’
THE FUNCTIONS OF CENTRAL BANKS
1) The central bank should possess the exclusive right of note issue. 2) A central bank in its management and policy should be free from government control and the influence of politics. 3) A central bank should be entrusted with the entire banking business of its own government. 4) A central bank should be the banker of the trading banks and should act as a settling agent for clearing differences between such banks. 5) A central bank should not ordinarily compete with the trading banks for general banking business. 6) A central bank should ensure to the public the provision of adequate banking facilities on reasonable terms. 7) A central bank should not take moneys at interest on its own account. 8) A central bank should quote publicly the rate at which it is prepared to discount approved bills, and should publish at regular and frequent intervals a clear statement of its position. 9) The assets of the central bank should be of the most liquid character possible. 10) A central bank should not draw or accept bills payable otherwise than on demand. 11) A central bank should not engage in a general exchange business on its own account for the purpose of earning profits. 12) A central bank should not engage in trade, nor have any interest in any commercial, industrial, or other undertaking. 13) A central bank should have no branch outside its own country, but may have agencies abroad.

The main functions and responsibilities of a central bank as they are described in Tables 1.2
and 1.3 were endorsed by the Financial Committee of the League of Nations, and most of
them were incorporated in the statutes of the central banks that either were established or
reformed with the sponsorship of the League during stabilisation in the 1920s. Central banks
were required to operate at arm’s length from the government and their assets and liabilities to
‘be of the most liquid character possible’. They were also expected to function as non
competitive, non-profit-seeking organisations, whose main mandate was the maintenance of
currency stability. In fact, in the 1920s when the charter of a European central bank was
revised, even if there had been no radical change in the monetary and banking policy, the
privileges and profits which had been originally granted to shareholders were reduced.42

1.2.3. The League of Nations and central banking reforms in the 1920s
Table 1.4 shows the central banks that were established during the interwar period. Twelve
new fully fledged central banks were established in the 1920s and seven during the 1930s, in
total 19. The Bank of Greece and the Hungarian National Bank are central banks that were
founded under the auspices of the League of Nations. Their establishment was a prerequisite
for the involvement of the Financial Committee of the League in de jure currency
stabilisation.

Sources: Pringle (1994, p. xii); Capie et al. (1994, pp. 182–219).
In the 1920s, the League of Nations intervened in the stabilisation of the currency and carried
out reconstruction schemes in six European countries. In each case, the Financial Committee
recommended and indeed insisted that the country should reform its banking system. These
banking reforms led to the strengthening of the institution of central banking. In addition,
throughout the interwar period the Bank of England encouraged the strengthening of central
banking not only in what may loosely be called the Dominions but also in other areas where it
could exercise its influence. Needless to say, the driving force behind the Financial
Committee of the League of Nations was the policy of the Bank of England. At the same
time, one American Professor, E. W. Kemmerer of Princeton University headed missions to
Latin America and was responsible for setting up central banks in several of the republics
there. The charter of a number of central banks that were established during the interwar period,
were drafted abroad by experts at the Bank of England or from the USA. These newly
established central banks were endowed with the latest central banking principles, powers and
techniques which were frequently in contrast with central banking practices in the country in
34


question. A representative example of this is the Bank of Greece, a central bank established
under the auspices of the Financial Committee of the League in the late 1920s. Its statutes
incorporated an escape clause that allowed the New Bank to act as a lender of last resort in
case of crisis. More specifically, the Bank of Greece could suspend full reserve requirements
for a specified period of time, of course with some penalty. However, if use of this provision
was made during the period that Greece was on the gold exchange standard, would the New
Bank have been able to maintain the external value of the drachma? Had the New Bank
established the credibility and authority necessary to resort to this provision without at the
same time creating further panic in the market? Furthermore, the Bank of Greece received
statutory independence in its purest form. In spite of this, a few months after it opened its
doors for business it experienced intervention by the prime minister concerning its discount
rate policy.43 This incidence demonstrates that neither de jure independence nor the League
supervision that the Bank of Greece enjoyed at the time could safeguard its autonomy from
practices embedded in the political circles.
Table 1.4 does not convey a full picture of the spread of central banking in the 1920s.
All European countries that experienced high inflation or hyperinflation in the 1920s
reformed their central banking system before de jure currency stabilisation. Central banks
were also established which did not survive beyond the Second World War because of
territorial changes or the spread of communism. Central banking was reorganised to respect
the new boundaries of successor countries to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The Austro
Hungarian Bank was liquidated, as the treaty of St. Germain-en-Laye ordered in 1919. The
Geneva Protocol of October 1922 provided for the establishment of a new bank of issue, and
the ‘re-established’ Oesterreichische Nationalbank began to operate on 1 January 1923.44 The
central banks of Germany, France, Belgium and Bulgaria were reformed when their
currencies were stabilised.
The reconstruction schemes that the Financial Committee of the League prepared in the
1920s incorporated resolutions of the Brussels and Genoa conferences. In addition, these
League stabilisation programmes recalled the international financial control introduced in
countries which defaulted during the fourth quarter of the nineteenth century.45 They were
comprised of two parts: firstly, institutional reforms were implemented which created a
commitment mechanism that made the stabilisation programme credible, and secondly, an

international loan under the auspices of the League was floated. The focus of the institutional
reforms was the central bank and accounting or auditing offices.46 A set of guidelines were
followed when central banking reforms were implemented, which echoed Montagu Norman’s
‘Epitome’. (See Table 1.2 above.) These guidelines were: (1) central bank independence; (2)
monopoly of note issue; (3) prudence in lending and discounting operations; (4) limits on new
advances to the government; (5) centralisation of the monetary transactions of all public sector
entities in the central bank; and (6) proper cover and reserve backing for the note issue.47
Compulsory balances to be held at the central bank could of course be imposed by law,
following the example of the Federal Reserve Act, but European practice went against it, and
the measure had to wait a few decades before becoming widespread on the continent. None of
the central banking laws of the 1920s mandated compulsory reserve requirements.48
Thomas Sargent’s (1982) suggestions of sustainable currency stabilisation resonate
the principles of the League reconstruction schemes. He argued that the essential measures
that ended hyperinflation in continental countries in the 1920s were firstly the creation of an
independent central bank ‘committed to refuse the government’s demand for additional
unsecured credit’, and secondly a simultaneous alteration in fiscal policy.49 Sargent, as Steven
Webb (1989, p. 74) remarks, developed his views on a successful stabilisation ‘by analysing
only the final stage of stabilisation’.50 This remark further recalls the Financial Committee’s
policy when it was approached by countries experiencing difficulties in accessing the
financial markets independently: a prerequisite was that de facto currency stabilisation should
have been achieved before they officially offered their assistance.
Reforms of banks of issue and the establishment of new central banks were aimed at
returning to the pre-war international economic order. Their objective was to facilitate
monetary stabilisation and adoption of the gold standard or the gold exchange standard, and
subsequently to secure maintenance of the achieved monetary stability. The objectives and
functions of central banks were carefully defined in these reforms and special attention was

49 Sargent (1982, p. 89).
50 Dornbusch (1988a, pp. 410–411) also challenged Sargent’s thesis by arguing that to institute a central bank or to pass a budget law is not by itself enough to ensure that these institutions will in fact become what they represent on paper, especially when the costs of the implementation of a stabilisation programme become apparent. Dornbusch (1988a) instead, argued that exchange rate and interest rate policies in the transition have traditionally formed the vehicle for establishing that credibility by a de facto stabilisation. Then, the improving budget situation may in turn attract capital flows that reinforce the stabilisation.

given to the relationship between the government and central banks in what is now referred to
as the independence of a central bank. In this way, international cooperation and capital
movements could be promoted. The Great Depression changed the international economic
environment and also economic thought. In addition it modified the reasons for the
establishment of a central bank.
In sum, although ‘the central core and rationale for the existence of a central bank is
not necessarily to be found in its macroeconomic role in (discretionary) monetary
management’51 it was on that role that international pressure was mainly focused after the
First World War. Under the resolutions adopted at the Genoa Conference in the spring of
1922, central banks were obliged to pursue two objectives: to facilitate currency stability and
once this was achieved, to support and maintain monetary stability.52 The objective of the
central banking reforms that were carried out under the supervision of the Financial Committee
of the League was to create central banks which would operate at arm’s length from
governments and in this way be able to enforce monetary discipline. Therefore, central banking
reforms in the 1920s were aimed primarily at making central banks statutorily independent of
their governments and at restoring monetary policy to the status quo ante.

2.1.1. Central banking and the National Bank
Before the establishment of a fully fledged central bank in Greece in 1928, the National Bank,
a joint stock bank established in 1841, carried out the public responsibilities of a central bank
whilst at the same time being by far the biggest and most powerful commercial bank in
Greece.53 From its institution in 1841 to 1864 and again from 1920 up to May 1928 the National
Bank had a complete monopoly in note issue as it was the only issuing bank in Greece. Between
1864 and 1920 it had a residuary monopoly in note issue as it shared the issuing privilege with
the Ionian Bank, the Bank of Epirus-Thessaly and the Bank of Crete.54 Nevertheless, the
National Bank was the most important issuing bank, responsible for the bulk of the banknotes in
53 Prior to the founding of the National Bank, an attempt to organise a currency and banking system in Greece was made by the first governor of the new country, Count Ioannis Kapodistrias, in 1828. In 1828, upon his arrival in Greece, Kapodistrias introduced the phoenix as the currency of the newborn country and founded the National Financial Bank which survived until 1834. The phoenix was replaced at par by the drachma in 1832 which remained as legal tender in Greece until January 2002 when the euro was introduced. For more information, see Valaorites ([1902] 1988, pp. 1–5); Spiliotopoulos (1949, pp. 10–17); Alogoskoufis and Lazaretou (1997, pp. 39–45); Dritsas (1999, pp. 10–13).
54 The Ionian Bank had a note issue privilege between 1864 and 1920, the Bank of Epirus-Thessaly between 1882 and 1899 and the Bank of Crete from 1913 to 1920.
38


circulation during the entire period of its history as an issuing institution. For example in 1914,
approximately 95 per cent of the banknotes in circulation were banknotes issued by the National
Bank. The origin of the remaining 5 per cent of banknotes in circulation was either the Ionian
Bank or the Bank of Crete.55
In the nineteenth century the National Bank was characterised by a conservative
perspective as well as by a lack of innovative entrepreneurial initiative.56 It can be compared
with other continental ‘public banks’,57 which combined unique public responsibilities with
commercial activities. The structure of the assets and liabilities of the Greek bank of issue was
close to the early North European central banking model, where ‘solidity of collateral’ was
more important than the liquidity that the classical model of central banking dictated.58
However, the National Bank is distinguished from those continental banks of issue as it never
evolved into a fully fledged central bank. A defining moment in the transformation of
continental banks of issue into fully fledged central banks was when their commercial interest
started to eclipse. By contrast, the National Bank did not allow the loss of its commercial
aspect either on its own initiative or through government intervention and consequently did
not evolve into a fully fledged central bank.
As a bank of issue, the National Bank developed very close links with the government
and enjoyed a comparative advantage vis-à-vis the other banking institutions. The state
centralised its payments system and all its deposits at the Bank and the National Bank controlled
all the government financial accounts. It also negotiated foreign loans for the government and
played a paramount role in the country’s adoption of a metallic system. This comparative
advantage was important for the development and prosperity of the National Bank because the
credit market in the country was small and the banking system underdeveloped. However, this
privileged position as the issuing bank in the country and as the bank of the government within
a fairly stable banking system did not encourage the Bank to develop in such manner as would
pave the way for its transformation from a dual-purpose bank into a fully fledged central bank.
55 The picture remains the same if the issuing privilege of the National Bank in the nineteenth century in comparison with that of the other banks of issue is examined. For example in 1869, 79 per cent of the banknotes in circulation were banknotes issued by the National Bank whilst the remaining 21 per cent were issued by the Ionian Bank. In 1897, 86 per cent of the banknotes in circulation were issued by the National Bank. The remaining 14 per cent of the banknotes in circulation were issued in equal proportions by the Ionian Bank and the Bank of Epirus-Thessaly. The years were chosen randomly to show that the National Bank had a residuary monopoly in the note issue in the nineteenth century. The data on banknotes in circulation used are from Kostelenos (1995 pp. 400–401).

57 In reality they were private institutions.

39


On the eve of the outbreak of the Great War, the National Bank combined public
responsibilities with pure banking activities. It was the bank of issue in the country, the
guardian of the gold and foreign exchange reserves and the bank of the government. At the
same time, it was the most important commercial and deposit bank. Its commercial activities
included short- and long-term credits to the private sectors of the economy, i.e. discounts,
loans to the agricultural sector, loans on pledged securities and merchandise, mortgage loans
and loans to public entities.
It has been argued that before the First World War, the National Bank was on the way
to transforming itself into a central bank, a process that had been adopted deliberately by its
governors.59 In 1914, however, the National Bank was competing with the other banks for
general business and its commercial aspect was flourishing. Furthermore, there is evidence
that in 1913 the National Bank tried to curtail the expansion of other banks in the country.60
This is a clear indication that the National Bank, despite enjoying the privileges of an issuing
bank, did not intend to abandon commercial activities and evolve into a fully fledged central
bank.
When the League representatives visited Athens in April 1927, although the National
Bank had a monopoly in the issuing privilege and undertook the public responsibilities of a
central bank it bore little resemblance to an ideal central bank as described by the governor of
the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, in his ‘Epitome’. The National Bank had a complete
monopoly of the note issue privilege and was the bank of the government but not the bank of
the banks. At the same time, it was still the most important commercial and deposit bank in
Greece, which could influence the conditions of credit directly through its own business. More
importantly part of its assets were not of the ‘most liquid character possible’ as the model of
central banking promoted by the Bank of England required.
The National Bank as an issuing bank and as a private institution pursued public
functions whilst at the same time it had to satisfy its shareholders. The main public duties
initially of a bank of issue were to maintain a stable currency and to guard the metallic
reserves whilst at the same time being the bank of the government. As a joint stock bank its
‘duty to the proprietors’61 was the dividend it paid and its commercial strength.

In 1919, Alexandros Diomides, then a sub-governor of the National Bank, stated at an
annual meeting of its shareholders that the National Bank was a private institution which at
the same time had a public character.62 This statement as the sub-governor himself admitted,
described the way that the Bank functioned and its duties to the government. In fact, it was
the way that the governors of the National Bank had managed ‘the two conceptions of their
business’,63 i.e. central banking responsibilities with commercial banking that safeguarded
and preserved the financial strength and consequently the reputation of the Bank during its
entire history as an issuing institution. A financially sound and strong National Bank created
the systemic stability that characterised the Greek banking system and made it a respectable
ambassador for the Greek government abroad.
During periods of well understood emergencies such as wartime and/or periods when
the Greek government had no access to financial markets, a reluctant private bank financed
the immediate needs of the government using the printing press and occasionally its own
reserves. During such emergencies the commercial aspect of the National Bank receded. The
National Bank curtailed its commercial activities to support the financial requirements of the
government. Its financial position was weakened as a great part of its balance sheet was tied
to illiquid government debt. Once the emergency had passed and attempts were made to
rationalise the monetary system and the economy as a whole then it was ‘duty to the
proprietors’64 of the National Bank that guided the policies of its governors. When
stabilisation was pursued the central bank played a paramount role. Stabilisation would
strengthen its position in the market and give it the opportunity to enhance its commercial
aspect. This policy acted as self-regulation that helped the National Bank to protect its
financial strength and reputation throughout its entire history as a bank of issue. A financially
sound National Bank created the systemic stability that characterised the Greek banking
system. It was the way that its ‘dual position’65 as a central bank and as a commercial banking
institution was managed that made the Bank one of the most significant and stable institutions
in Greek economic history, an organisation that can be classified as a national institution.

2.1.2. International financial intervention and the development of central banking in
Greece, 1898–1928
During the period in question the Greek government twice resorted to capital markets to borrow
with assistance and supervision: in 1898 and once again 30 years later, in 1928. On both
occasions conditionality was introduced related to central banking practices in Greece.
After the Greek government’s default in 1893 a long period of discussion over the
settlement of the foreign debt of the country started, initially between Greece and foreign
bondholders and then between Greece and the Great Powers, that is to say Britain, France,
Germany, Russia, Italy and Austria. A debt compromise was finally achieved in 1898 after
Greece had been defeated in the 1897 war with Turkey and was forced to pay a war indemnity.
The debt compromise led to the enactment of the Law of Control or the ΒΦΙΘ Law as it is
known in Greek and the flotation of the 2.50 per cent Guaranteed Loan in 1898. The Law of
Control was a legal document specifying the obligations of the Greek government in order for
the Great Powers to support it borrowing from the capital markets. It was a detailed plan for the
reconstruction of the Greek public debt and specified the establishment of the International
Financial Commission (IFC). The IFC was an international body that assumed responsibility for
the service of the Greek public debt that was placed under its jurisdiction. Accordingly, the
Greek government assigned a large part of its public revenues to the IFC and the latter
administered these in accordance with the terms of the Law of Control.66 The IFC was a debt
management committee which at the same time supervised monetary policy in Greece, as the
Law of Control stipulated strict rules governing the issue of banknotes and by doing so
defined the relation of the central bank to the government. It should be noted that the Law of
Control did not stipulate that Greece had to adopt the gold standard, as is usually claimed by
modern scholars.
In 1898, the Greek government partially surrendered its fiscal and monetary
sovereignty – a fact that was resented in Athens and caused a lot of dispute. Greek
governments often clashed with the representatives of the Great Powers in Athens over the
interpretation of certain aspects of the Law of Control. During the negotiations with the
League, in Geneva in June 1927, Greek representatives were therefore anxious to avoid any
kind of control or any sort of foreign intervention in Greek public affairs.
The governor of the National Bank moved to the Ministry of Finance as a minister
and headed the negotiations with the representatives of the mediatory powers. The National

Bank, through its governor, might have not only endorsed but also influenced the
conditionality incorporated in the Law of Control which related both to monetary policy and
to the way that internal public debt was reconstructed. As is shown in this thesis, the measures
stipulated by the Law of Control helped the National Bank to improve its financial strength
and expand its commercial activities. Furthermore, conditionality incorporated in the Law of
Control constrained monetary policy and helped the bank of issue to control monetary
developments in Greece for as long as the conjuncture allowed it. A suggestion by its sub
governor led to a monetary arrangement in March 1910 which helped the drachma to maintain
its Latin Monetary Union (LMU) parity up to 1919. This 1910 monetary arrangement, or
ΓΧΜΒ Law as it is known, has led contemporary economists and economic historians to
argue that Greece introduced either the gold standard or the gold exchange standard during
that year. By contrast, before the 1980s it was generally believed that the Greek currency had
remained inconvertible throughout the period from September 1885 when the gold standard
was suspended until May 1928 when the gold exchange standard was de jure adopted.
The influence of the IFC on Greek fiscal and monetary developments is usually
thought to have been effective. The drachma appreciated and indeed reached its LMU parity
in 1910, remaining at par until 1919. In addition, the service of the public debt continued
smoothly until April 1932 when the Greek government defaulted. In fact, the interest rate paid
to bondholders of external public debt increased and reached its contractual level in the 1920s
as Table A4.1 in Appendix A4 indicates. Last but not least the Greek government managed to
return, although very cautiously, to the capital markets in 1902. This thesis, however, departs
from the view that the presence of the IFC in Athens was the main reason for the successful
monetary advances and the improvement of the creditworthiness of the Greek government on
the international capital markets. Here it is argued that the ‘credibility’, in other words the
successful implementation of the Law of Control, rested on acceptance of conditionality and
willingness to implement it.67 Firstly, a powerful institution, the National Bank, was
committed to strict monetary rules introduced by the Law of Control. The Old Bank was also
able to control and influence monetary developments. Secondly, the appreciation of the
drachma was in line with the prevailing political economy in Greece. Both the government
and the National Bank were in favour of a stable drachma close to its LMU parity. It is also
important to highlight that monetary discipline was followed for as long as the historical
circumstances allowed it. As is extensively discussed, inflationary policies were used to
finance Greek participation in the Great War and the Asia Minor campaign in spite of the
presence of the IFC in Athens. Last but not least, the improvement of the creditworthiness of

the Greek government after the enactment of the Law of Control, as measured by a Greek
government loan’s spread on the London market relative to the British consols, is a more
complex and multifaceted issue than is generally assumed in the literature. This question,
however, is beyond the scope of this thesis. Future research could shed light on this complex
issue, that is to say to what extent the IFC was responsible for the improvement of the Greek
sovereign risk, and perhaps more importantly, the way that the Law of Control and Greek
sovereign risk were intertwined.
The Greek government resorted to the League of Nations for a second time in the
spring of 1927, in order to borrow on the international capital markets under its aegis. The
reconstruction scheme prepared incorporated institutional reforms focused primarily on
central banking practices in Greece, which led to the establishment of a fully fledged central
bank, the Bank of Greece, whilst its precursor continued pursuing commercial activities,
remaining at the same time the most important commercial bank in Greece.
The National Bank itself would not have implemented such radical reforms of its own
volition in 1928. By the time the Greek delegation arrived in Geneva in June 1927 to request
officially the assistance of the League in stabilising de jure the drachma, the National Bank
had already lost its monopoly on mortgage credit of its own accord to a newly established
National Mortgage Bank. This was the only monopoly that the bank of issue had enjoyed
since its foundation in 1842 and one which it willingly conceded to another banking
institution in the late 1920s. As Table 3.7 in Chapter 3 demonstrates the significance of
mortgage credit as an asset item of the Old Bank had diminished by 1926 in favour of more
liquid assets, following a long period of war and high inflation. The newly established
mortgage bank was after all very close to the National Bank.
In June 1927 the governors of the National Bank faced the dilemma either of radically
reforming the bank of issue so as to comply with central banking principles advocated by the
Bank of England, or retaining its dual-purpose status and letting the Greek authorities ‘seek
succour elsewhere’.68 As is explained in detail in Chapter 7, in the end a compromise was
reached after a suggestion from the sub-governor of the bank of issue: the National Bank
could continue its commercial activities and instead it would transfer to a new bank the
issuing privilege and all the activities and responsibilities which belonged to a central bank.
Thus, the governors of the National Bank amended recommendations by the Financial
Committee of the League and in this way safeguarded the financial strength and consequently

the market power of the National Bank. Furthermore, the architects of the central banking
reform protected certain privileges of the Old Bank and thus its unique status in the Greek
banking market. The League stabilisation programme attracted considerable opposition in
Athens which threatened the existence of the New Bank in the 1930s. However, the National
Bank did not participate in this controversy and never attempted to regain the central banking
privileges that it had lost as a result of the implementation of the League’s stabilisation
programme.
By the time that the 1898 Law of Control and the 1928 League stabilisation
programme were signed, conditionality had been accepted by those that were most affected.
By contrast, after the outbreak of the current economic recession successive Greek
governments have been expected to implement widespread structural reforms demanded by
their lenders which, however, have mustered very little support. Resistance and delays in the
implementation of structural reforms in a fairly unstable and polarised political environment
are among the most important reasons that have led to a deep and protracted economic
recession. A ‘war of attrition’ with distributional implications among different socio
economic groups has taken place and the burden of a huge and rapid fiscal adjustment has
been shifted onto those that can bear it least, and to future generations.69
2.2. The establishment of the Bank of Greece in the historiography
Contemporaries regarded the establishment of the Bank of Greece as a symbol of foreign
intervention in the country and compared its creation with the introduction of the Law of
Control in 1898. Since then, this observation has been repeated occasionally.
‘The founding of the Bank of Greece was accomplished to facilitate the reformation
of the monetary conditions that had been created by the wars that the country had engaged in,
as well as the economic repercussions thereof. It was an important step towards the
modernisation of the economic institutions of the country.’70 Kostas Kostis (1986, p. 115)
writes that ‘the establishment of the Bank of Greece as the central bank of the country was
regarded and since then has been regarded as an attempt to rationalise the Greek economy and
as an indication of state interference in regulating economic activities’. He further argues that
it is difficult for this interpretation to be challenged, and adds that the establishment of the
New Bank was not a Greek initiative, restating in this way the argument that the creation of

45


the central bank symbolised foreign intervention into Greek political and economic issues.
Meanwhile, Thanasis Kalaphatis (1999, p. 25) relates the establishment of the Bank of Greece
to the ΓΧΜΒ Law of 1910 and sees it as a result of government intervention in the banking
system.71 Christos Hadziiossif (1993, p. 249) goes a bit further by arguing that the splitting of
the National Bank was aimed both at helping Greece to incorporate itself into the international
economic system and at facilitating the flow of capital in and out of Greece.
Previously, G. Vouros (1938, p. 6) had stressed the fact that the banking reforms that
led to the establishment of the New Bank were a necessary by-product of changes in the
economy post 1923, i.e. after the Asia Minor debacle and indeed G. Pyrsos (c1935, p. 15)
suggested that this reform was vital for the economic reconstruction of the country.
More recently Michalis Psalidopoulos (2011, pp. 74–75; 2014, p. 77) argued that a
public debate between the governor of the National Bank and Britain’s representative on the
IFC which was conducted largely in the pages of The Times of London in the autumn of 1925,
helps to understand why foreign creditors introduced central banking reforms a couple of
years later.72 This public debate in The Times which created quite a stir in Athens, highlights
ideological differences between these two men in addition to difficult choices related to
monetary policy that the governor of the National Bank faced in 1925. In the end, however, as
is discussed in Chapter 6, the influence of the IFC on central banking reforms was very
limited.
Study of the establishment of the central bank in Greece has been approached along
the following lines. Scholars that treated this issue in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s gave a
detailed chronological description of the events as well as of the dispute that the creation of
the Bank of Greece provoked since it was hardly welcomed by Greek banks or politicians.
Literature concerning the New Bank was intended to examine how it operated after its
establishment and mainly came to light during a commemoration of an anniversary of the
Bank of Greece. Present day scholars that have referred to the creation of the Bank of Greece
have only done so as part of broader research on the interwar period. Hence, the reasons that
led to the establishment of the central bank in Greece remain to be examined.
It is hard to dispute the earlier interpretations where the core of the argument has been
that the establishment of the New Bank was necessary to facilitate the reconstruction of the
71 The enactment and evolution of ΓΧΜΒ Law of 1910 is extensively examined in Chapter 4 of this thesis.

economy after a long period of war and monetary upheaval in the 1920s. It is also implied that
these banking reforms were beneficial for economic development. However, these
explanations refer to the consequences of the establishment of the central bank rather than to
the reasons for banking reforms in the late 1920s.
Internal forces resulting from macroeconomic policy and the condition of the banking
system in Greece in the late 1920s, would not have led to the establishment of a fully fledged
central bank in that period. On its own initiative, the National Bank was prepared to
implement only minor changes such as the establishment of the Mortgage Bank in 1927, the
only operation it seems it was willing to concede to another institution. In addition, the
political climate tended to support the general inertia of the National Bank towards real
change.
There is reference in the literature to Eleftherios Venizelos, by far the strongest
political figure in Greece after 1909, having stated in an interview in Britain’s Morning Post
in 1917 that ‘the National Bank would be reorganised and would become simply a bank of
issue’.73 This was actually said not in an interview in the Morning Post but in the Greek
parliament. (The Morning Post published a report of the occasion when the Prime Minister,
Venizelos answered a question about a loan that the previous pro–German Greek government
had contracted with Germany on which the National Bank had acted as an intermediary.74)
However, his reaction to the banking reforms, when in 1928 he returned to the country and to
power, indicates that the changes he could have implemented were not much different from
those that the National Bank had favoured.
Serious concern about the condition of the banking system in Greece had always been
expressed by scholars. First, A. Soutsos (1882, vol. I, p. 518) criticised the multifaceted
character of the National Bank, and expressed doubts as to whether it could fulfil all its
functions properly. On the same grounds, Ch. Damiris in a book published in 1920 criticised
the National Bank, stressed the fact that it had too much power over the monetary and
banking system and argued for change. It is interesting that Damiris was the only one who
referred to the fact that the National Bank had never been the bank of the banks and had no
legal obligation to fulfil such a function.75 Finally, N. Bakopoulos (1920) published a book on
central banks wherein he described the functions and objectives of a full blown version of the
institution but did not refer to or criticise the National Bank. These objections and criticism

over the size, functions and power of the National Bank had very limited impact and could
not by themselves have led to fundamental changes in the banking system.
2.3. Objectives and contribution of the thesis
The focus of this thesis is twofold: firstly, to examine the evolution of central banking
institutions in Greece between the enactment of the Law of Control in 1898 and de jure
stabilisation of the drachma in 1928. Secondly, to explore the impact that foreign supervision
had on the evolution of central banking in Greece, given the complex relationship that Greece
had with its foreign creditors. To these ends, the characteristics of central banking in Greece,
a country on the European periphery, prior to the establishment of the Bank of Greece are
unravelled and contrasted with the central banking standards that foreign creditors had
adopted and promoted at the time.
This study looks at the ‘dual position’ of the National Bank; it examines its role both
as a central bank and as the most important commercial bank in Greece. A crucial question
that is asked is why the dual-purpose National Bank was not in a position to transform itself
into a fully fledged central bank on its own initiative following a path similar to that of other
European central banks and described by the natural evolution hypothesis. Furthermore, it
asks why the commercial activities of the Old Bank were so important that, in the end, it
chose to retain that aspect of its business moving forward, when prior to 1927 it had so
fiercely guarded its central banking privileges. Hence, an important contribution of this thesis
is a painstaking and in-depth analysis of the tension between the public responsibilities of the
National Bank as a central bank and its duty to its proprietors.
Time series are constructed using not only quantitative material such as the published
balance sheet of the National Bank but also a variety of qualitative sources to illustrate the
evolution of the National Bank as a bank of issue, bank of the government and as the most
important commercial bank in Greece. The objective is to explore the way in which the
governors of the Old Bank managed ‘the two conceptions of their business’,76 i.e. central
banking responsibilities and commercial banking, whilst safeguarding the financial strength
and consequently the reputation of the National Bank throughout its entire history as a dual
purpose bank. Furthermore, the time series constructed show changes that a long period of
war, high inflation and subsequent reconstruction brought to the commercial aspect of the
National Bank and to its role as an issuing bank and a bank of the government. Highlighting

changes that occurred in the structure and composition of the assets and liabilities of the dual
purpose National Bank between the enactment of the Law of Control in 1898 and the spring
of 1927 when the League of Nations was approached helps to understand what the governors
of the Old Bank sought to achieve through stabilisation and how they envisaged stabilisation
would affect its financial status.
The time series constructed demonstrate that the changes brought about by a long
period of war and monetary upheaval to the structure and composition of the balance sheet of
the Old Bank determined banking reforms in the late 1920s. It is shown that the National
Bank used to focus its commercial activities on mortgage credit and time deposits. However,
the significance of these two items on the balance sheet of the Bank decreased because of a
long period of war and high inflation. This change on the Old Bank’s balance sheet also
explains why, of its own volition, it conceded its mortgage credit privilege to a newly
established mortgage bank in June 1927. Moreover, the newly constructed time series
graphically indicate that the relationship between credits supplied to the economy and
bilateral public debt held by the National Bank fundamentally altered after 1918.
A further contribution of this thesis is that the monetary arrangement introduced in
March 1910, which is known as the ΓΧΜΒ Law or the Valaorites Law, is extensively
examined; its principles and evolution until 1919, the last time it was used to increase the
money supply, are scrutinised. This monetary arrangement has prompted contemporary
economists and economic historians to argue that Greece adopted a clearly defined monetary
rule during that year, even though there is no agreement amongst them on which standard
Greece did in fact introduce. However, before the 1980s it was believed that the Greek
currency had remained inconvertible throughout the period from September 1885, when the
gold standard was suspended, until May 1928, when the gold exchange standard was de jure
introduced. An objective here is to draw attention to the discrepancy between the way that
monetary change in Greece in 1910 is seen in recent economic history literature and the way
it was considered by scholars and policy makers at the time. Furthermore, it will be
demonstrated that the way the ΓΧΜΒ Law was employed to increase the banknotes in
circulation after the outbreak of the Great War, and indeed to finance the active participation
of Greece in the war, was one of the most important reasons for the high inflation experienced
at the time.
To a large extent, the long-term impact of war on the financial structure is a result of
the need for direct and indirect funding of any conflict and its preparation as well as of the
cost of possible reparations. Therefore, both conventional and unconventional methods used
49


by the Greek government to finance a long period of war and its aftermath are examined in
detail. The objective is firstly to study the extent to which the National Bank itself financed
government expenditure during a period when the Greek government had no access to
international financial markets; secondly, to analyse the impact that government borrowing
had on the Old Bank; and finally, to acknowledge the origins of the monetary upheaval of the
1920s. It can be shown that high inflation stemmed from the way that the printing press was
used to monetise budget deficits. As is evidenced, the Old Bank proved to be the main source
of financial support for the government and a complex relationship was created between
them. High inflation in the 1920s wiped out a significant part of the nominal value of bilateral
public debt denominated in drachmae owned by the National Bank without entirely
eliminating it. The National Bank aimed at reducing it still further during de jure stabilisation.
The creditworthiness of the Greek government on the London market between the
enactment of the Law of Control in 1898 and the implementation of a League stabilisation
programme in 1928 is also examined. The objective is to demonstrate the negotiating power
that the Greek government had in that market. In addition, research into the press of the
period shows that market participants were kept well informed, and promptly too, about
developments in Greece and thus were able to evaluate country risk during a time when a
system of formal rating had not been developed.
The stabilisation plans proposed by the different participants are explored and
ideological disparities as well as differences in the way that they envisaged that stabilisation
would affect institutions with respect to fiscal and monetary policy are exposed. The aim is to
highlight differences amongst those involved or tempted to become involved in the
stabilisation of the drachma, that is to say the National Bank of Greece, the Greek Ministry of
Finance, the IFC, the Bank of England and later the Financial Committee of the League of
Nations.
A comparison of foreign intervention and financial support between the Law of
Control of 1898 and the Geneva Stabilisation Plan of 1928 is carried out, as these institutional
arrangements were harbingers of the establishment of the International Monetary Fund. The
aim is to reveal both the similarities and differences in institutional reforms sponsored by
foreign creditors during those two distinctive periods. Differences in the flotation of the
respective loans are also denoted.
The restructuring of domestic public debt in 1898 is briefly discussed. The aim is to
demonstrate the way in which the financial position of the Old Bank was affected by this debt
50


readjustment. This thesis also illustrates the way in which government debt held by the
National Bank before central banking reforms was distributed between the Old Bank of issue
and the New Bank. The objective is to strengthen the argument made that the National Bank
during the negotiations with foreign creditors both in the late nineteenth century and in the
late 1920s sought to achieve a compromise, which at the same time would be favourable to its
financial position.
The negotiations with the League representatives are discussed in detail and the
objections raised by the governor of the National Bank to its metamorphosis from a dual
purpose bank to a modern central bank are presented. The objective is to show that the
particular domestic variation on the League of Nations’ norms that led to the establishment of
a fully fledged central bank in Greece in 1928 happened with the consent of the National
Bank. In fact, it is demonstrated that the ways in which central banking reforms were carried
out were aimed at strengthening the financial position of the Old Bank of issue. How
cautiously news of the central banking reform was announced and circulated in Athens is also
shown. Finally, the thesis closes with an analysis of the institutional arrangements
surrounding the establishment of the Bank of Greece. The objectives and functions of the new
central bank are described and its financial position upon commencement of operations is
evidenced.
This thesis contributes to the understanding of the origins of the central banking
reforms in Greece in the late 1920s as part of the process of currency stabilisation. It unravels
the political economy at the root of these reforms and sheds light on the factors that impeded
the transformation of the National Bank from the bank of issue in Greece and the bank of the
government into a fully fledged model of a central bank. It places in historical perspective
issues of political economy that shaped central banking reform in the 1920s and led to a
domestic variation on the League of Nations’ norms. It is also demonstrated that the evolution
of the institution of central banking in Greece follows a disparate route from that described by
the natural evolution hypothesis formed by Goodhart and based on a comparative analysis of the
experience of several mainly European nations. In this way, this thesis seeks to provide insight
into the formation of the institution of central banking and its application to small open
economies. Examination of the establishment of the Bank of Greece can help to draw broader
conclusions about the evolution of central banking and the establishment of central banks de
novo. Furthermore, it examines the contribution of the League of Nations and the Bank of
England to the evolution of central banking in the 1920s and highlights the main principles of
this institution as they were then.

2.4. Overview of the archival sources and data used
The research in this thesis relies on a variety of sources both qualitative and quantitative that are
geographically spread between Athens, London and Geneva. In Athens, archival research has
been carried out at the following archives: the Emmanouil Tsouderos Archive at the Bank of
Greece, the Historical Archives of the National Bank of Greece, the Alexandros Diomides
Archive deposited at the Greek Literary and History Archive, which is now part of the National
Bank of Greece Cultural Centre, and last but not least the Alexandros Diomides Archive at the
Historical Archives of the National Bank. In addition to the archives in Athens, the Bank of
England Archive and the Midland Bank Archive in London, as well as the League of Nations
Archive at the United Nations in Geneva were consulted. The Hambros Bank Archive available
at the Guildhall Library was also visited. However, the archival material on Greece for the
period in question at Hambros Bank Archive is insignificant. The documents on Greece there
primarily refer to the period prior to the outbreak of the First World War.
The thesis also draws on printed primary material such as the press of the period, both
Greek and British, parliamentary papers and records of debates, publications of the League of
Nations and contemporaneous literature. Invaluable information from the British press for the
purpose of this thesis provides material systematically collected from a wide range of mainly
daily press and organised in a continuous format of cutting books by the Council of the
Corporation of Foreign Bondholders. These cutting books are now held at the Guildhall
Library in London.
The Emmanouil Tsouderos Archive deposited at the Bank of Greece covers the period
from the early 1920s until the Second World War and does not bear the hallmark of a personal
archive to any great extent. By contrast, both archives of Alexandros Diomides consist mainly
of personal correspondence. The material at the Tsouderos Archive is very rich and includes
reports written for a variety of purposes, statistical data for his own information,
correspondence, cables and cuttings from the press of the day. It provides extensive and
valuable information on the 1920s and in particular on the negotiations for the stabilisation of
the drachma between Athens, the Bank of England and the League of Nations.
The Historical Archives of the National Bank are probably the richest and most
significant archives in Greece for an economic historian writing on the period before the Second
World War. It is an invaluable repository from which to draw both qualitative and quantitative
material for the analysis in this study.
52


The Annual Reports of the National Bank have been used extensively here to construct
a variety of time series covering the period in question. As a primary source for the 1920s,
however, it has its limitations. Accountancy practices that were employed during the monetary
upheaval of the 1920s obscure the real financial position of the Bank during that period. The
consequent difficulty stems from the way that assets and liabilities denominated in gold and
foreign exchange were reported on the balance sheet of the Bank. The advisor to the Bank of
Greece, Horace C. Finlayson described this very vividly in his annual report for 1929. Finlayson
wrote that the balance sheet published by the National Bank every six months prior to the
reorganisation of the banking system ‘succeeded in solving the problem of adding four chairs to
four o’clock to make eight! Gold francs (or drachmae) were added up together with paper
drachmae so that the statements are bewildering even to the most discerning eye’.77 The
outcome of this practice is to understate the value of figures denominated in gold drachmae that
appear on the balance sheet of the National Bank from the point where the drachma began
depreciating in 1919 until stabilisation. Consequently, what is reported as total assets on the
balance sheet of the National Bank in the 1920s prior to stabilisation is an understatement of its
true financial position.
The material found in the archives in Athens is complemented by primary sources from
the Bank of England Archive. This primary material comprises a variety of documents ranging
from reports on Greece to minutes of meetings between Greek officials and representatives of
the Bank of England. Most of the material used in this thesis is drawn from Sir Otto Niemeyer’s
Papers.78 Niemeyer joined the Bank of England as an Advisor in 1927 having previously been
Controller of Finance at HM Treasury. Apart from his general responsibilities on the overseas
side of the Bank of England, he also was a member of the League of Nations Financial
Committee from 1922 to 1937 and the chairman of that Committee in 1927 when the
Reconstruction Plan for Greece was prepared. He also worked feverishly to propagate central
banking orthodoxy throughout the entire interwar period.
Last but not least, the League of Nations Archive in Geneva was visited. The most
important primary sources kept at Geneva can, however, also be found at the Bank of England
Archive and/or in archives in Athens. Furthermore, the entire collection of the printed material
of the League kept at its archive is also available at the British Library of Political and
Economic Science.

In the 1920s, governments started collecting data and encouraged publications where
the data amassed were presented. The Greek government was no exception and in the 1920s
began publishing the Statistical Yearbooks which contain data on all aspects of the economy
from public finance to literacy.79 The data collected as well as the indices produced in these
Yearbooks have been widely used both by contemporaneous scholars and contemporary
economic historians.
Contemporary economic historians have either collected together data and/or
constructed time series covering a broad spectrum of the economy.80 The balance sheet of the
National Bank published twice a year is the principal source of the data for the history of this
institution. In his research, Kostis has made extensive use of this source to organise data
covering different aspects of the history of the National Bank and to produce financial ratios
covering the period between the late nineteenth century and the outbreak of the Second World
War.81
A variety of price indices constructed either at the time in question or by contemporary
economic historians is available. Firstly, the Statistical Yearbooks provide a retail price index
and a cost of living index. Neither indices are weighted and the method used to construct them
is apparently that of the arithmetic mean. In addition, all data employed for their construction
are available in the Statistical Yearbooks. Secondly, during the 1920s Xenophon Zolotas (1928,
1929) constructed a number of price indices (including a monthly retail price index), which,
however, do not cover the whole period in question here. In his usual fashion, Zolotas neither
disclosed his sources for the data used nor the methodology employed. It is, however, highly
probable that he used the very same data available in the Yearbooks.82 Thirdly, a price index
based on a Laspeyres formula and on the data in the Statistical Yearbooks was constructed by
George Kostelenos for the period in question.83 Fourthly, a GDP deflator has been estimated on
the basis of a selection of ten items and based on the Paasche formula.84 Finally, George
Mitrofanis has constructed a price index.85 However, no information is available either on the
method employed or the data used for the construction of this price index.

The most important price indices available are presented in Figure 2.1. A comparison of
them reveals some differences. In spite of these differences, however, the general picture that
they produce for the period in question remains the same. In this thesis, all price indices
mentioned above are treated with caution, a consideration that places constraints on the analysis.
The main reservation stems from the fact that the items used for their construction are not
representative of all the sectors of the economy, having been taken mainly if not exclusively

In this thesis, resort to available published data is made selectively and with caution. In general
the approach that has been adopted is to return to the original sources and construct new time
series, often of high frequency data when this has been possible. Therefore, a number of new
time series have been constructed that are related to the fiscal, monetary and exchange rate
issues studied here. Time series of the creditworthiness of the Greek government on the London
Stock Exchange between 1896 and 1930 have also been constructed. Furthermore, this thesis
brings together a wide array of data that demonstrate the financial position of the National Bank,
its relation with the government and the manner in which the printing press was used as a tool of
monetary policy during the period in question.

3.1. Structure of the banking system in Greece in 1927
On the eve of their reform Greek banks could be divided into three categories. In the first
category the National Bank of Greece, instituted in 1841, stood alone not only because of its
dual-purpose character as a bank of issue and as a commercial bank but also because of its size
which enabled it to dominate the country’s banking system. Next came a handful of banks,
established around the turn of the century and finally a third category of small, mainly local
banks, most of which were established after the end of the First World War. In addition, there
were some foreign banks operating in the country and two special institutions, namely the Post
Office Savings Bank and the Deposit and Loans Fund. Finally, during that same year, on 1 June
1927, the National Mortgage Bank, a bank specialising in mortgage credit had started to
operate. Table 3.1 below shows the banks that operated in Greece in 1927, the year of their
59


foundation and the number of branches that each of them had. As Table 3.4 below shows, 17 of
these banks were listed on the Athens Stock Exchange.

* The banks marked with an asterisk were either liquated or went bankrupt after 1929.
1 The Number of branches of each bank refers to 1928.
2 The National Mortgage Bank started operations on 1 June 1927.
3 The Bank of Property of Crete was renamed Bank of Crete in 1927.
4 The Bank of Property and the Bank of Property of Piraeus were designed to specialise in mortgage credit, the Agrarian Bank of Greece and the Bank of the Agrarian Credit in agricultural credit and the Bank of Industry in industrial projects. In practice, however, none of these banks pursued aims set out in their respective statutes.
5 In 1927 the General Bank of Greece was merged with the Popular Bank and the Greek Securities Bank with the Bank of Industry; the Bank of Peloponissos and the Pavlos’ Bank were both liquated; the Maritime Bank of Piraeus was merged with the Sea Ventures Ltd Company.
6 The Bank of the Orient was acquired by the National Bank in 1932. In that same year the Popular Bank was bought by the Ionian Bank.

One of the principal characteristics of the Greek banking system was its considerable stability
which was mainly due to the ‘great weight and prestige’ of the National Bank, a profit
maximising dual-purpose bank which at the same time was a conservative and risk-averse
institution. It was a branch banking system and as Table 3.1 illustrates, in 1928 there were in
total 272 branches of various banks spread all over the country. Two banks, the Bank of Athens
and the National Bank, had established by far the most branches: the Bank of Athens had 98
branches whilst the National Bank had established 83. Then, the Commercial Bank of Greece
61


followed with 34 branches. The majority of the rest of the banks had no branches at all as Table
3.1 demonstrates whilst those having branches, had established only a few.
After the end of the Great War the banking system in Greece expanded rapidly with the
establishment of a great number of small, primarily local banks. This was prompted firstly, by
the introduction of a law in 1920 relating to limited companies which encouraged bankers to
turn their offices into small family banks and in this way to benefit from the taxation advantages
that this law provided.86 As a consequence by the end of the 1920s nearly no bankers’ offices
remained. Secondly, the increase in the market with the annexation of the New Areas after the
end of the Balkan Wars and the influx of over a million refugees from Asia Minor created the
conditions for the expansion of the banking system. Last but not least, the monetary upheaval of
the 1920s also encouraged the establishment of small local banks.87
The central bank, that is to say the National Bank, had no statutory powers over the
banking system.88 According to the legal framework as it related to banks before 1926, any
limited company could undertake banking activities. Only in 1926, a couple of years before the
banking reforms, was a law introduced that required any new bank being established to have
capital of at least 15 million drachmae.89 This legal prerequisite checked the establishment of
new banks after 1926.90 Nevertheless, these banks were small, primarily family banks and the
main source of their profits seems to have been speculation on the exchange rate. Aggelopoulos
(1928, p. 53) estimated that in 1924, 52 per cent of the gross profits of the banks came from
foreign exchange operations, 51 per cent in 1925 but only 39 per cent in 1927.91 When the
drachma was de facto stabilised in 1927 not only did the more precarious of the new banks stop
popping up but also those that had been established started experiencing difficulties. During the
Great Depression many of the small local banks either closed down or were acquired by other
healthier banks.92
Another characteristic of the banking system was that it was not competitive and lacked
diversification and specialisation. The banks in Greece were primarily deposit banks and the
new banks that appeared in the 1920s followed this tradition. There were, however, exceptions
86 This was the Law 2190/1920. For more, see Aggelopoulos (1928, pp. 31–32); Kostis (1997, p. 27).

signalling a need for diversification in the banking system. For example, the Bank of Industry
established in 1918 by a group of industrialists had as its objective the promotion and support of
industry.93 The Bank of Property and the Bank of Property of Piraeus aimed at specialising in
mortgage credit whilst the Agrarian Bank and the Bank of Agrarian Credit at agricultural credit.
All these new banks, however, remained small and undercapitalised and did not manage to
encourage competition in the system whilst their professed specialisation remained a mere
pledge in their statutes.
All in all, the increase in the number of banks operating in Greece in the 1920s did
not bring fundamental changes in the banking sector. The real transformation of the banking
system in Greece happened in a short span of time, namely between 1927 and 1929, when the
country obtained three specialised banking institutions: firstly in 1927 a mortgage bank, the
National Mortgage Bank; then in 1928 a central bank, the Bank of Greece; and finally in 1929
an agricultural bank, the Agricultural Bank of Greece. These sweeping banking reforms led to
the modernisation and rationalisation of the banking system in Greece and perhaps constitute
the most important transformation of the banking system in the country in its entire history.
The size of the National Bank was huge and it dominated the market with almost
monopolistic powers. The representatives of the League that came to Athens in April 1927 to
investigate the economic situation in the country stressed this characteristic of the National
Bank in their report.94
Total assets or liabilities are usually used as a measure to compare the size of banks.
The National Bank, however, was a dual-purpose bank, a bank of issue and at the same time
the biggest commercial bank in the country. A comparison of total assets or liabilities of the
National Bank with a sample of other Greek banks is in any event distorted by the fact that the
total of the banknotes in circulation was reported on the balance sheet of the National Bank.
Moreover, the 1920s was a period of high inflation and accountancy practices employed by
banks to record both assets and liabilities denominated in foreign exchange and gold often
distorted their real financial position. This is particularly the case with the National Bank, as
has been explained in Chapter 2.
In this thesis, the deposits and market capitalisation of a handful of banks are used as
measures to assess the size of the National Bank vis-à-vis other banking institutions in
93 Kyrkilitsis (1934, p. 87); Kostis and Tsokopoulos (1988, p. 60).

Greece. Both measures paint the same picture; the National Bank was far bigger than any of
the other banks.

Notes:
1 This is total deposits in thousand of drachmae that the six banks cited above received. Part of these deposits was denominated in gold drachmae. For example, 4.05 per cent of the deposits of the National Bank in 1926 were deposits in gold drachmae.
2 Government deposits at the National Bank are not included. In 1926, 12.40 per cent of the total deposits of the National Bank were government deposits.
3 This is the total of deposits that Kyrkilitsis (1934, p. 42) reported. Kyrkilitsis did not cite the original source of the data that he reported, nor provided information on the number of banks included.
Sources: Annual Report of the National Bank for 1926; Annual Report of the Bank of Athens for 1926; Kyrkilitsis (1934, p. 42); Kostis and Tsokopoulos (1988, pp. 182–196).
Table 3.2 shows the total deposits that the National Bank and a sample of other commercial
banks received in 1926. These are the Bank of Athens, the Popular Bank and the Commercial
Bank established before the outbreak of the Great War and the Piraeus Bank and the Bank of
Industry established in 1916 and 1918 respectively. Deposits reported in Table 3.2 are sight,
time and savings deposits whilst the government deposits that the National Bank held as a
consequence of its role as the bank of the government are not included. 1926 was chosen as a
benchmark for the comparison as it was the last year before any of the banking reforms of the
late 1920s was carried out. A few months later, in June 1927, the Bank handed over to the
newly established Mortgage Bank the majority of its time deposits.
Table 3.2 shows that the National Bank alone attracted approximately 40 per cent of the
total deposits in the country. In other words, it received 60 per cent of the deposits of the sample
64


of six banks presented in Table 3.2. It is evident that the National Bank was nonetheless the
predominant deposit bank in Greece. The Bank of Athens follows with 14 per cent of the total
deposits in spite of having had a widely spread network of branches as Table 3.1 above shows.
In addition, the deposits of the Bank of Athens represented only one-third of the commercial
deposits of the National Bank. The Popular and the Commercial Bank held only 10 per cent of
total deposits between them. Finally, Table 3.2 shows that the banks established after the
outbreak of the Great War had not managed to capture a significant part of the deposit market
by 1926. For example in 1926, the deposits of the Piraeus Bank established in 1916 were only 1
per cent of the total deposits in the country whilst the Bank of Industry’s were 1.27 per cent.
Another way to compare the size and the power of the National Bank vis-à-vis the
country’s other banks is to compare the share capital of the National Bank with that of other
banks. Table 3.3 shows the book value of the share capital and the reserves of the National Bank
alongside some banks established before the outbreak of the war as well as the Bank of Piraeus
and the Bank of Industry founded in 1916 and 1918 respectively. However, to compare the
book value of the capital stock of the banks included in Table 3.3 is misleading. The share
capital of the National Bank cannot be compared with the book value for example of the capital
of the Bank of Industry.95 The stock capital of the National Bank had remained the same since
1884, the last time that it was increased. On the other hand, the Bank of Industry raised its stock
capital between 1918 and 1925 which was a period of high inflation. The third column of Table
3.3 shows the reserves of the banks mentioned above. The reserves of the National Bank quoted
in this table do not include the reserves that it was required by law to maintain after 1923 as the
central bank in Greece. Half of these reserves that the National Bank was required to hold as the
bank of issue in Greece in fact belonged to the government. In 1926 these reserves amounted to
120 million drachmae.
95 For example, see Kyrkilitsis (1934, p. 21); Kostis (1987, p. 233; 1990, p. 166).

4 The capital and reserves of the Bank of the Orient were reported in francs; 35,000,000 francs as capital and 8,163,187.25 francs as reserves.
Sources: HABOG_A3S1Y1F4T1, p. 97; the data for the National Bank come from its Annual Report for 1926; Kostis and Tsokopoulos (1988, pp. 182–196).
Table 3.4 below shows all the banks that were listed on the Athens Stock Exchange. In addition,
it shows the number of shares and the average price of the share of each bank in 1926 as well as
its market capitalisation. It is apparent again that the most important bank was the National
Bank. At the time, 36 per cent of the market capitalisation of the banking sector was vested in
National Bank. Once again, the Bank of Athens follows with 22 per cent. The Commercial
Bank holds the third place with 12 per cent of the market. In addition, Table 3.4 demonstrates
yet again, though in a different way, that the size of the banks established after the outbreak of
the First World War remained small indeed.
In sum, in spite of the expansion in the number of banks after the outbreak of the Great
War, the National Bank still remained the most important bank in Greece in the spring of 1927
when the representatives of the League visited Athens. Its size, compared to the other banking
institutions, was huge and its commercial aspect dominated the lending market. Last but not
least, it continued to be the principal bank of deposit.

3.2. Credits to the Economy
3.2.1. Introduction
The National Bank opened its doors for business on 22 January 1842 (Julian calendar) as a
mortgage bank which at the same time enjoyed issuing privileges. Indeed, according to its
initial statutes three-quarters of the banknotes it placed in circulation could be covered by
mortgage loans. This provision was, however, annulled in 1843 as mortgage bonds, being a
long-term investment, were not considered a suitable asset with which to cover the banknotes
in circulation.96
The National Bank developed all kinds of commercial banking activities as time went
during the ‘long’ nineteenth century. In 1861 agricultural credit was added to its portfolio
whilst three years later, in 1864, loans and current accounts against securities were permitted.
In 1871, the Bank was also allowed to participate in limited companies under the condition
that they operated within the Greek borders. In addition, in 1880 its mortgage activities were
expanded further to include loans to legal entities. In 1897, loans could be given on pledged
warrants and in 1900, loans as well as advances against merchandise were authorised.97
The National Bank continued to pursue all these different activities up to the late
1920s when banking reforms were implemented. In particular, the evolution of both mortgage
and agricultural credit in Greece up to the late 1920s was closely correlated with the
development of the National Bank. The Bank was the only bank in Greece prior to the
banking reforms of the late 1920s that supplied loans to the agricultural sector, mortgage
credit and loans to legal entities. In 1926, prior to any banking reform, the National Bank
added a new activity to those mentioned above that was related to the settlement of refugees
in urban areas in Greece: it engaged itself in the indemnification of urban refugees in Greece
for their property left behind in Asia Minor.
In this section of Chapter 3, credits provided by the National Bank to the economy are
examined. Credits to the economy include all credit, short- and long-term, granted to the
productive sectors of the economy. They include discounts, loans against securities and
merchandise, loans to the agricultural sector, mortgage credit and loans to legal entities.
Discounts, loans against securities and merchandise were short-term credit as they were
usually granted for three months. Loans and advances to the agricultural sector stood alone; in

general, they were furnished for a period between six to nine months. By contrast, mortgage
credit and loans to legal entities were mainly long-term credit.
In its entire history as a dual-purpose bank, the National Bank had always pursued
commercial activities in a conservative and risk-averse manner. Loans were supplied
cautiously and the solvency of its clients was carefully scrutinised. Principal officials of the
National Bank assured the representatives of the League of Nations that visited Athens in late
spring of 1927 that the entirety of the commercial credit provided by the National Bank was
considered ‘absolutely sound’.98 Certain rules were followed and exceptions were made only
in rare cases. The same report listed the general rules applied by the Bank to all the
commercial credit that it provided. No credit was automatically renewed and renewal was
possible only after the guarantees attached had been thoroughly examined. No prior notice
was necessary to terminate a credit at the date of its repayment. Current accounts were an
exception to this and prior notice of termination was required. In addition, a current account
could be closed whenever it was judged that the guarantees provided had diminished. The
Bank could make available different types of credit to a customer but the total loaned was
always aligned with that customer’s solvency.99
As is repeatedly asserted, the commercial aspect of the National Bank was an
essential part of the Bank during its entire history as a ‘dual bank’, i.e. whilst it combined
central banking responsibilities with commercial activities. In this section, the evolution of the
commercial activities of the National Bank between 1898 and 1930 are examined and the
changes that occurred during a long period of war and monetary upheaval are highlighted.
Examination of the commercial credits provided by the National Bank to the productive
sectors of the economy also sheds some light on credit conditions in Greece. This analysis
also reveals that the National Bank was not on the way to transforming itself into a fully
fledged central bank following the evolutionary model of other European central banks. In the
spring of 1927, when the League of Nations was approached, the National Bank was involved
in all kinds of commercial activities and had no resemblance at all to the model of a central
bank pioneered by the governor of the Bank of England.
The investments of the Bank in other banks and companies, just one of its asset
classes, are not examined here. The focus is on short- and long-term credit as well as loans to
the agricultural sector. In addition, the activity related to the indemnification of urban
refugees in Greece, although an activity close to the commercial interests of the National

Bank, is studied in the section on its relationship with the government. This task was
intertwined with the dual character of the Bank and was retained when the Bank of Greece
was established. In fact during the first couple of years of the National Bank as a commercial
bank that are examined here this activity had an important position amongst its assets.
Firstly, some general information on the commercial activities of the National Bank is
provided. Secondly, the size of the commercial activities of the National Bank as a percentage
of GDP of the country and the total assets of the National Bank is examined. Thirdly, the
evolution of credits to the economy at constant 1911 values is estimated and the changes that
occurred during the period in question are pinpointed. Fourthly, a comparison of the
commercial credit furnished by the National Bank and by the Bank of Athens is attempted.
Subsequently, the share of each commercial task in total credits is studied. In this way, the
character of the National Bank as a commercial bank is further examined. Finally, this part
finishes with some concluding remarks.
This is the first time that time series related to the commercial aspect of the National
Bank have been constructed and analysed methodically. By this means the evolution of its
commercial aspect during the period in question has been exposed. It should be stressed,
however, that no similar analysis on the commercial activities of the National Bank from
1842 up to 1897 has been carried out so far. Without such research, an examination of the
evolution of the commercial role of the National Bank during its entire history as a dual
purpose bank is not possible.
3.2.2. A description of the commercial activities of the National Bank
Discounts:
Discounts included bills discounted and current accounts against personal guarantees. The
Bank discounted bills for a period up to three months. Subsequently, bills could be renewed
up to three times under the condition that the amount involved was insignificant. In the 1920s,
they were discounted against personal guarantees and by statute should have borne at least
two signatures.100
Discounting took place on the basis of nominal lists, carefully compiled by personnel
of the National Bank. These lists were revised each year. Both an individual and a business
had to be included in those lists in order to be able to present a bill for discounting.101

Loans against Securities:
Credit against securities was given for a period up to three months. It could be renewed if the
securities deposited offered sufficient margin. The stocks and bonds eligible for collateral
varied from government bonds denominated either in gold or drachmae to shares of business
enterprises such as wine companies or building societies.102
Loans against Merchandise:
Advances and current accounts against merchandise were also granted for a maximum period
of three months and could be renewed up to three times if the guarantees provided sufficient
margin.
The evaluation of pledged merchandise was carried out by experts from the Bank and
was repeated each month. In the event that the margin had decreased, the National Bank
required either a decrease in the debt or additional guarantees.103
According to the League Report of 1927, the National Bank furnished advances of up
to 50 per cent of the market value of merchandise. The maximum of 50 per cent of the market
value was enjoyed by only a few products. For example the equivalent percentage in the case
of tobacco was 30 per cent. On the other hand, it is noted that the Bank furnished advances of
up to 75 per cent of the market value of cereals, which was clearly an exception.104
Agricultural Credit:
Agriculture was the most important economic activity in Greece throughout the period in
question in this thesis as well as the exclusive source of export goods. The National Bank had
a monopoly on granting credits to this sector up to 1929 when the Agricultural Bank of
Greece was established. In the nineteenth century, credit to farmers by the Bank of Epirus
Thessaly was fairly insignificant. In addition, loans that could be supplied by small local state
banks that specialised in agrarian credit and operated in the New Areas annexed after the
Balkan Wars remained negligible.105 Furthermore, the commercial banks that were
established after the turn of the twentieth century did not include agricultural credit into their
activities as the business was not regarded as profitable.106 Interest rates for credit to farmers
were set by law and as a result did not allow sufficient profit.

When the National Bank was established in 1841, its charter vaguely stated its
obligation to the agricultural sector.107 Twenty years later in 1861 when the issuing privilege
of the National Bank was renewed, credit to the agricultural sector was added formally as a
responsibility. That year, the commercial activities of the Bank were extended by law in such
a way so as to include loans to farmers. From then on the National Bank was obliged to grant
farmers up to 2 million drachmae each year.108 Agricultural credit, however, appears on the
balance sheet of the National Bank as a separate entry only after 1893.109 In 1896 an
agreement between the National Bank and the government increased the credit that the
National Bank had to make available to the agricultural sector to at least 10 million drachmae
each year.110
Once again when the issuing privilege of the National Bank was renewed in 1914 for
the last time in its history as an issuing bank, it was agreed to increase credit to agriculture to
25 million drachmae.111 During that year an institutional development also occurred which is
regarded as a turning point in the literature on the evolution of agricultural credit in Greece.112
In 1914, a law was passed that allowed for the establishment of agricultural co-operative
societies.113 After that year, the National Bank started channelling credit to the agricultural
sector through those co-operative societies. By the end of 1915 nearly 5 per cent of the credit
granted by the Bank to the agricultural sector had been given to co-operatives. In 1922, half of
the credit to agriculture was granted directly to farmers and the other half to co-operatives. By
1928, however, only 25 per cent of the agricultural credit was supplied as loans directly to
farmers, whilst the remaining 75 per cent was given to co-operative societies.114 During this
period the number of co-operative societies in Greece increased very rapidly; from 150 in
1915 to 4,148 in 1926 the majority of which were engaged in credit activities.115
Agricultural credit was usually a six- to nine-month credit.116 Loans to farmers were
rarely renewed other than in the case of destruction of the harvest and under the condition that
additional guarantees were not required. Credit to farmers was limited and intended to cover
the needs of basic subsistence from season to season. Only a small portion of the credit
granted to agriculture was aimed at capital improvements or the improvement of the value of

the land; for example for the undertaking of drainage projects, the building of warehouses or
even for the purchase of land and tools. In such cases, the credit was given for a maximum of
five years.117
The interest rate charged by the National Bank on agrarian credit was determined by
law and it was usually lower than its discount rate. In addition, after 1914 the interest rate for
credit channelled to agricultural co-operative societies was lower by 1 per cent than that
directed to individual farmers.118 Credit to the agricultural sector, which as already noted was
monopolised by the National Bank was, however, available only to large farmers who could
comply with the requirements set for collateral. Small farmers and peasants depended on
informal chains of credit where punitive interest rates were charged whilst at the same time
usurious interest rates were banned by law.
In 1919 the Law of Fictitious Chattel of Tobacco Crop was passed. Before the
introduction of this law, agricultural loans were regulated only by the Law of Chattel
Mortgage of 1836, which virtually repeated Roman-Byzantine Law.119 Moreover, in 1920 a
further legal change occurred: the agricultural warrant was introduced.120 Between 1914 and
1920, therefore credit conditions for farmers improved considerably with the introduction of
the law that allowed the establishment of agricultural co-operatives and the two further legal
changes, the introduction of the Law of Fictitious Chattel of Tobacco Crop and the
agricultural warrant. Prior to these institutional changes, legislative efforts to facilitate and
improve agrarian credit concerned themselves solely with devices to prohibit usury rather
than with the reorganisation of the general legal principles of the chattel mortgage and loan
contract.121
A further turning point for agricultural credit conditions during the period in question
and indeed the most important institutional reform for agriculture up to the end of the interwar
period was the establishment of an agricultural bank, the Agricultural Bank of Greece, in
1929. It is generally believed that with the establishment of the Agricultural Bank, credit
conditions for farmers improved fundamentally and credit became available to the agrarian
sector at large at an affordable price. These issues, however, are beyond the scope of this
thesis. Further research needs to be carried out to establish the veracity of such claims, as well
as the timing of the de-escalation of punitive interest rates for the agrarian sector.

When the Greek government was negotiating a stabilisation programme with the
League of Nations, the minister of agriculture, Alexandros Papanastasiou, was campaigning
for the establishment of an agrarian bank which would be responsible for agricultural credit in
Greece.122 In addition, this prospective agrarian bank would undertake compulsory
expropriation of land and the rehabilitation of all landless peasants, regardless of whether or
not they were refugees. This proposal, which would have led to the establishment of an
autonomous agrarian bank operating independently from the National Bank, faced fierce
opposition both from the National Bank and the political world in Athens.123 Furthermore,
archival material at the Bank of England shows that the Refugee Settlement Commission
(RSC) – the committee that was responsible for the settlement of refugees in rural areas in
Greece – also objected, in fact strongly, to the establishment of an independent agrarian bank.
In spite of strong opposition to this project, in February 1928 an agreement was signed
between the National Bank and the government that provided for the establishment of an
autonomous organisation, known in the literature as the Agrarian Bank, which would aim at
improving the welfare of the agricultural community at large. This agreement between the
National Bank and the government, however, was never approved by parliament and as a
consequence the Agrarian Bank was never founded. The principal argument was that this new
banking institution would not be adequately capitalised.124
Nevertheless, two years later in January 1930, the Agricultural Bank of Greece
opened for business. The statutes of this bank were, however, very different from those of the
proposed Agrarian Bank and its foundation was directly related to the establishment of the
Bank of Greece. Upon his return to Greece, after the Bank of Greece began its operations in
May 1928, Venizelos raised objections to the way that the minister of finance of the all party
government which had de jure stabilised the drachma, had handled the issue of covers of the
National Bank.125 In brief, a new agreement between the Old Bank and the government
provided that part of the surplus value of the covers that under the stabilisation programme
were maintained by the National Bank as compensation for the early loss of its issuing
privilege, would be used as capital for the establishment of an Agricultural Bank. As a result,
part of the surplus value of the covers was given as a ‘dowry’ to the Agricultural Bank which
started business in January 1930.

The establishment of the Agricultural Bank signalled the end of the banking reforms
that began with the establishment of the Mortgage Bank in June 1927. In those three years,
the National Bank lost its privileges and the monopolies that it held: it ceased being the
issuing bank and the bank of the government as well as conceding its monopoly on mortgage
and agricultural credit to two newly established specialised banking organisations.
Mortgage Credit:
The National Bank monopolised mortgage credit in Greece up to 1927 when the National
Mortgage Bank of Greece was established. Its mortgage credit consisted of two different
categories of loans: general mortgage loans to the public and loans to legal entities. Credit to
legal entities included loans to municipality, ports and other legal organisations. A small
portion of the general mortgage credit could have been medium-term credit given on
mortgage guarantees. This portion of mortgage credit, which was in fact insignificant, is
included here with mortgage loans.
The interest rate charged on mortgage credit was set by law. Furthermore, the interest
rate paid by legal entities was lower than that charged on mortgage loans to the general
public. In the 1920s, loans to public entities could have an amortisation period of up to 40
years but in practice they did not exceed a maximum period of 30 years.126 Credit to legal
entities was secured by a pledge to the National Bank on the revenues of these organisations.
In most cases the revenue of legal entities were paid directly to the National Bank and after
the annuity was deducted the surplus was reimbursed to the organisations concerned.127
The National Bank could issue bond loans in order to collect capital for mortgage
credit. Before the 1927 reform, the Bank had provided mortgage credit facilities floating loans
exclusively for this purpose on five occasions: twice in the middle of the 1920s and three
times prior to the outbreak of the First World War.128
The first serious attempt to organise and expand mortgage credit in Greece occurred
in 1920 with the publication of the 2413 law.129 It has been argued that previous attempts to
organise mortgage credit had been obstructed by the National Bank.130 The 1920 law
specified that any joint stock bank with a capital of at least 10 million drachmae could
exercise mortgage credit. It was, however, never implemented and four years later was

replaced by a new law which indeed regulated mortgage credit in detail. The 1924 mortgage
law denoted that the paid up capital of a joint stock bank exercising mortgage credit facilities
should be at least 50 million drachmae and its activity had to be centred exclusively on
mortgage credit and loans to legal entities.131
The 3221 law of 1924 laid the foundations for the establishment of the Mortgage
Bank of Greece by the National Bank itself in 1927. This monopoly on mortgage credit that
the Bank had enjoyed since its foundation in the nineteenth century was the only one of its
privileges that it conceded voluntarily during the banking reforms of the late 1920s. It is
possible that the governors of the National Bank were encouraged by Hambros Bank officials
to take this initiative.132 Hambros Bank was the official bank of the Greek government in
London and had at the same time established close links with the National Bank. Both the
governor and the sub-governor of the National Bank had spent long periods of time in London
meeting officials at the Bank of England and also visiting Hambros Bank’s headquarters.
They may have realised that the mortgage credit activities of the National Bank could have
easily been an impediment to achieving their aim of accessing the London financial market.
In the City, it was believed that an institution could not be engaged in central banking and at
the same time pursue mortgage credit activities. Nevertheless, a week after the Mortgage
Bank opened its doors for business in June 1927, an agreement was signed between the
Mortgage Bank and the Hambros Bank that provided for the issue of a loan on the London
market. This loan was guaranteed by the National Bank and was aimed at increasing the
available capital for mortgage loans supplied by the new bank.133
The National Bank conceded to the newly established mortgage bank all the assets
and liabilities that related to its role as a mortgage bank. Indeed, it handed over to the new
mortgage bank most of its long-term assets and liabilities. That is to say that in terms of assets
the National Bank ceded all its mortgage loans as well as most of the credit that it had
extended to legal entities. In addition, it passed on to the new bank real estate that had been
acquired by confiscation. At the same time, the liabilities that the National Bank passed on to
the Mortgage Bank consisted of time deposits and the loans that had been issued to fund
mortgage credit.
The initial capital of the Mortgage Bank was 80 million drachmae divided in shares
of 1,000 drachmae each. Three-quarters of this capital, that is 60 million drachmae, was

covered by reserve funds of the National Bank, which subsequently distributed gratis the
equivalent amount of shares as compensation to its shareholders: one share of the National
Bank corresponding to three shares of the Mortgage Bank. The remaining capital of 20
million drachmae was also contributed by the National Bank, this time using its cash reserves.
The shares that the Bank obtained were included in its portfolio of investments.134

Table 3.5 above shows total credits to the private economy as a percentage of GDP. Credits to
the economy include all credit, short- and long-term, furnished to the real economy. In other
words, they include discounts, loans against securities and merchandise, loans to the agricultural
sector, mortgage loans and loans to legal entities. The table shows that from 1899 to 1913, total
credits to the economy by the National Bank fluctuated between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of
GDP. In 1908, they accounted for over 30 per cent of GDP, the maximum share observed
during the entire period in question. Credits to the economy as a percentage of GDP in 1898
were only 16 per cent, the lowest percentage share observed prior to 1913. Since no similar
research has been conducted, it makes it difficult to know if the level of credits to the economy
as a percentage of GDP in 1898 is an outlier or if it denotes the dominant trend of a period that
ended with the enactment of the Law of Control.
A change in the relationship between the Bank and the economy is noticed after the
outbreak of the Great War. Between the outbreak of the First World War and the end of the
period in question, total credits to the economy as a percentage of GDP shrank substantially,
indicating ‘a loosening of the links’ between the National Bank and the economy.135 In
particular, between 1917 and 1928 when the National Bank lost its central banking privileges,
total credit to the economy fluctuated between 7 per cent and nearly 12 per cent. Credits to the
economy as a percentage of GDP fell to as low as 7 per cent in 1918 and again in 1923. They
were also 7 per cent of GDP at the end of 1927, the year that the National Bank conceded long
term assets to the newly established Mortgage Bank.
After the banking reform, credits to the economy as a percentage of GDP increased,
pointing to an improvement in the relationship between the National Bank and the economy.
The same caveat, however, applies again: no similar data exist for the period after the banking
reforms to examine the relationship of the National Bank with the economy.
Table 3.6 shows credits to the economy as a percentage of total assets of the National
Bank between 1898 and 1919 and then again between 1928 and 1930. As has been mentioned
before, accountancy practices during the monetary upheaval of the 1920s obscure the real
financial position of the Bank during that period. The value of figures denominated in gold
drachmae or foreign exchange that appear amongst the assets of the National Bank was
understated from the time when the drachma began depreciating in 1919 until stabilisation. As
a result, what was reported as total assets on the balance sheet of the National Bank in the
1920s prior to stabilisation was an understatement of its true financial position. It should be

noted that a small portion of credits to the economy was denominated in gold drachmae. In
spite of this, however, total credits to the economy have been estimated assuming that they
paint a fairly accurate picture, since their fraction expressed in gold drachmae was small
indeed.

Table 3.6 shows that between 1898 and 1910, credits to the economy granted by the National
Bank represented a significant part of its total assets, fluctuating between 31.86 per cent and
47.31 per cent. Between 1901 and 1911 they remained above 40 per cent, reaching their
highest percentage of 47.31 in 1908.

Table 3.6 also shows that from 1910 until 1919, credits to the economy as a
percentage of the assets of the National Bank decreased constantly, in spite of their increase in
nominal values during that same period. They fell to as low as 11.80 per cent of total assets in
1918. In March 1910, the ΓΧΜΒ Law was enacted and subsequently the balance sheet of the
National Bank experienced a period of rapid expansion which was primarily due to this Law.
(For more on the ΓΧΜΒ Law see Chapter 4.) Banknotes in circulation increased rapidly and
at the same time the gold and foreign exchange reserves of the Bank were augmented, as the
ΓΧΜΒ Law dictated, by the same amount as the newly printed banknotes. As Ioannis
Valaorites, the father of this Law, remarked insightfully in 1913 the ΓΧΜΒ Law ‘did not
increase at all the resources that the Bank could make available to trade, industry and
agriculture’.136 To recap, the fall that can be seen in the commercial credits furnished by the
National Bank as a percentage of its assets between 1910 and 1919 is due not to a decrease of
their volume but to the rapid expansion of the balance sheet of the National Bank caused
mainly by the ΓΧΜΒ Law. As Table A2.2 of Appendix A2 shows, credits to the economy
increased in nominal drachmae between 1911 and 1919. However, that having been said they
increased more slowly than the rate of the expansion of the total assets of the National Bank.
In the 1920s prior to the establishment of the Bank of Greece, the share of credits to
the economy as a percentage of total assets of the National Bank must have remained low. By
the end of the Asia Minor campaign, the structure of the assets of the National Bank was very
different from that observed between the introduction of the Law of Control in 1898 and the
enactment of the ΓΧΜΒ Law in 1910. Illiquid government debt owned by the National Bank
had increased. Credits to the economy at nominal prices had also swollen but their pace of
increase was slower than that of total assets. As Table A2.3 of Appendix A2 demonstrates,
this rise in credits to the economy was below the rate of inflation.
After the introduction of the ΓΧΜΒ Law the significance of credits to the economy
supplied by the National Bank as a percentage of its total assets shrank. Credits to the
economy as a percentage of the total assets of the National Bank remained small until the
banking reform in 1928. This decrease in the significance of credits to the economy in the
total assets of the National Bank was due to changes in the structure and composition of its
assets. During that period the National Bank did not give up any of its commercial activities
nor did it intend to do so. The decrease in the total credits to the economy as a percentage of
its assets was caused firstly by the operation of the ΓΧΜΒ Law and secondly by changes in
136 Kokkinakis (1999, p. 540).

the balance sheet of the National Bank produced by a long period of war and monetary
upheaval.
The balance sheet that the National Bank published at the end of 1928 followed the
Bank having lost its issuing privilege and been transformed into a pure commercial bank. As
expected, the share of credits to the economy as a percentage of its assets surpassed those of
the immediate period prior the introduction of the ΓΧΜΒ Law. At the end of 1928, credits to
the economy accounted for nearly 43 per cent of the assets of the National Bank whilst the
following year they made up over half of its assets; the maximum percentage share observed
during the entire period in question here.
Credits to the economy by the National Bank at 1911 prices were estimated using the
data gathered in Table A2.2. The price index produced by Kostelenos et al. (2007) was used
as a deflator. It was, however, rebased from 1914, the base year of the original time series, to
1911 – the last year that Greece was not engaged in war prior to the outbreak of the Balkan
Wars. Every different category of credit to the economy by the National Bank was estimated
at constant prices in addition to total credits to the economy and the result is presented in
Table A2.3 of Appendix A2. Subsequently, the time series of credits to the economy at
constant prices were transformed into ratio form with 1911 again as the base year. In addition,
total short- and long-term credit expressed as a ratio was also estimated and shown in Table
A2.4 of Appendix A2.

Figure 3.1 above displays total credits to the economy at 1911 values expressed as a ratio.
This figure demonstrates that credits to the economy increased until 1912. This increase in
total credits is also denoted in Tables 3.5 and 3.6 above, where credits to the economy are
expressed as a percentage of GDP and of total assets of the National Bank. Then, a constant
decrease is noticed until 1918. Between the end of the Great War and the stabilisation of the
drachma in 1928 total credits to the economy at 1911 values fluctuated from year to year as
both Figure 3.1 and Tables A2.3 and A2.4 in Appendix A2 demonstrate. As is mentioned
above, total credits to the economy at nominal prices increased considerably in the 1920s.
Credits to the economy by the National Bank at nominal prices dropped only in 1927 – the
year that the Mortgage Bank was established. Figure 3.1, however, demonstrates vividly that
this rapid increase in total credits at nominal prices in the 1920s was purely inflationary. In
the 1920s, prior to the stabilisation of the drachma, total credits to the economy at 1911 prices
remained low – close in fact to their level at the beginning of the century. Moreover they were
volatile. It is noticeable that in 1923 total credits to the economy at constant values reached
the lowest level observed since the outbreak of the Balkan Wars. They surpassed their 1911
level only in 1929. As is demonstrated below, however, by then the composition of total
credits to the economy had radically changed because of the banking reforms of the late
1920s.

It should be reminded that the data used for the analysis here have been hand-collected from
the balance sheet of the National Bank and show its position at the end of each year. Figure

Figure 3.2 are presented in Table A2.4 of Appendix A2 and demonstrate that short-term
credits at 1911 values increased until 1908. Subsequently, between 1909 and 1923 they
fluctuated around their 1911 level. It should be noted that between 1916 and 1919 short-term
credits at constant values remained below their 1911 level. By contrast, after 1924 they
persistently surpassed their 1911 level and after the banking reforms experienced a rapid
increase until the end of the period in question.
Table A2.4 in Appendix A2 also presents discounts and credit against securities and
merchandise. It indicates that both discounts and credit against securities followed the same
path as total short-term credits. On the other hand, credit against merchandise increased
abruptly in 1903. This sudden increase was due to credit being furnished by the National
Bank to the Currant Bank, an organisation established in 1899 to focus on the currant
problem.137 This loan was guaranteed by currants. It should also be noted that between 1916
and 1927, credit against merchandise ballooned and that by the end of the period so much so
that it took up an important position amongst credits to the economy provided by the National
Bank.

Figure 3.3 shows credit furnished by the National Bank to the agricultural sector during the
period in question. Agricultural credit expressed at 1911 prices increased until 1905.
Subsequently, it remained stable, close to its 1911 level until the outbreak of the First Balkan
War in 1912. By contrast, between 1913 and 1923 agricultural credit provided by the National
Bank was constantly below its 1911 value. Figure 3.3 shows that after 1924 the National

Bank started supplying credit generously to the agrarian sector. Credit to farmers increased
rapidly until the establishment of the Agricultural Bank in 1930. It is usually argued in the
literature that the institutional changes described above, i.e. the establishment of co-operative
societies and the legal changes implemented in 1919 and 1920 fostered this rapid increase in
credit to the agrarian sector after the end of the Asia Minor debacle.
Figure 3.4: Total mortgage credit at 1911 values, 1898–1930 (1911=100) Source: Table A2.4 in Appendix A2.
Figure 3.4 presents total mortgage credit at 1911 prices during the period in question. Total
mortgage credit is composed of general mortgage loans and loans to legal entities. Figure 3.4
indicates that total mortgage credit at constant values increased up to 1911 and then remained
stable until the outbreak of the First World War. Subsequently, total mortgage credit fell
considerably and indeed remained below its 1911 level until the end of the period in question.
After the establishment of the Mortgage Bank in 1927 as Table A2.2 of Appendix A2
demonstrates, the National Bank stopped supplying general mortgage credit. This table also
shows that after 1927 the Bank continued granting some mortgage credit though entirely
made up of loans to legal entities.
Examination of the structure of credits to the economy will shed further light on the
nature and characteristics of the commercial aspect of the National Bank. This analysis will
also expose changes that occurred in the commercial aspect of the Bank from the enactment
of the Law of Control in 1898 until the establishment of the Agricultural Bank in 1930.

As has been mentioned previously, the National Bank had a monopoly on mortgage and
agricultural credit and at the same time it furnished all kinds of short-term credit, i.e.
discounts and loans against securities and merchandise. Table 3.7 presents each different
category of commercial credit as a percentage share of total credits supplied by the National
Bank. In addition, it shows the share of short-term and mortgage credit in total credits to the
economy.
Table 3.7 shows vividly that mortgage credit was the most important commercial
activity pursued by the National Bank up to end of the Great War. It also demonstrates that at
the beginning of the century mortgage credit still remained the most important commercial
activity of the National Bank, despite the fact that it was engaged in central banking
functions. Between 1898 and 1918 mortgage credit, i.e. both general mortgage loans and
loans to legal entities had the lion’s share of total credits to the economy. During this period,
at least 50 per cent of the total credits granted by the National Bank consisted of mortgage
loans; in 1898 the percentage share of mortgage loans was 72.25 per cent whilst by 1917 it
had dropped to 56.02 per cent. At the same time, the percentage share of agricultural credit
granted by the National Bank varied at between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of total credits.
A long period of war and monetary upheaval altered the structure of credits to the
economy on the balance sheet of the National Bank. The banking reforms of the late 1920s,
however, changed fundamentally the nature of the National Bank as a commercial bank. In
1926, short-term credit represented 47 per cent of total credits supplied by the National Bank
and agricultural credit 17 per cent whilst mortgage credit had dropped to 36 per cent of total
credits. By the end of the following year a radical change had occurred in the structure and
composition of the commercial aspect of the Bank because of the establishment of the
National Mortgage Bank. In 1927, the National Bank conceded general mortgage credit and
the majority of the loans that it had provided to legal entities to the newly established
mortgage bank. As a result, mortgage credit fell to 3.30 per cent of total credits to the
economy whilst the percentage share of short-term credit rose to 62 per cent and that of
agricultural credit to 35 per cent. As Table 3.7 shows discounts alone accounted for
approximately 40 per cent of the total credits furnished by the National Bank in 1927.
Moreover, in 1930 a further change in the commercial status of the National Bank was
realised with the establishment of the Agricultural Bank. At the end of that year the
percentage share of short-term credit increased still further, accounting for 81 per cent of total
credits to the economy. Thus, in the late 1920s the Bank conceded two monopolies which had
been important for its commercial status since its foundation; it lost its monopoly on mortgage


and agricultural credit. Furthermore, its business mainly concentrated on granting short-term
credit.
3.2.4. A comparison of the National Bank with the Bank of Athens
In this section of Chapter 3, credits to the economy furnished by the National Bank are
compared with credit granted by the Bank of Athens. This comparison helps to illustrate
further the importance and strength of the National Bank on the Greek market. It also exposes
the differences between the National Bank as a commercial bank and other banks. The Bank
of Athens was established in 1893 and until the end of the period in question it remained the
most important rival of the National Bank for general commercial business. The Bank of
Athens, upon its foundation, expanded its business beyond the borders of the Greek Kingdom
to include areas with thriving Greek communities. For example, by 1910 the Bank of Athens
had created a widespread network of branches in Greece, the then autonomous Crete, Turkey
and Egypt, as well as in London, Khartoum and Limassol.138
Geopolitical changes in the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire at the time affected the
status of the Bank of Athens. Some areas where the Bank of Athens operated were annexed
by Greece and after the Asia Minor debacle it was forced to abandon completely its business
in Turkey. In the 1920s, it still pursued business abroad in areas like Egypt and Cyprus and
expanded successfully its business network in New York and Boston.139 By contrast, the
National Bank whilst being a dual-purpose bank operated exclusively within Greek borders.
Having said that, after the end of the Great War the National Bank founded short-lived
branches in areas later ceded to Greek administration by the Treaty of Serves.140 For example,
in January 1920 the Greek bank of issue opened a branch in Smyrna, ‘a city with more Greek
inhabitants than Athens’.141 Beyond any financial objectives, however, the presence of the
National Bank in Asia Minor aimed at supporting Greek irredentism and facilitating the use of
the drachma as a medium of exchange in an area that remained under Turkish sovereignty and
where the lira continued to be the legal tender.142 In 1919, the administration of the Bank also
explored the possibility of extending their business in the USA. However, it was 1926 before
they managed to open an agency in New York and an office in Chicago to attract Greek
diaspora savings.143 Subsequently, after the National Bank lost its issuing privilege the Bank

tried to strengthen its presence in the USA by forming the Hellenic Bank Trust Company in
New York.144
A further crucial difference between the commercial aspect of the National Bank and
the Bank of Athens was that the latter specialised in short-term credit as did most of the other
banks in Greece. Some mortgage credit was reported on the balance sheet of the Bank of
Athens after 1901 but it remained insignificant throughout the period in question. On the
other hand, as it has been mentioned above, the National Bank had a monopoly on mortgage
credit until 1927. Between 1898 and 1926 mortgage credit fluctuated, as Table 3.7 shows,
between 72 per cent and 28 per cent of total credits furnished to the economy by the National
Bank. In addition, the National Bank was the only bank in Greece to provide credit to the
agrarian sector until the establishment of the Agricultural Bank.
Table A2.6 in Appendix A2 presents credit supplied by the Bank of Athens as
compared with that by the National Bank. In the first column, credit supplied by the Bank of
Athens is juxtaposed with the short-term credit supplied by the National Bank. Mortgage
credit given by the Bank of Athens is subtracted from the total credit that it furnished. The
second column of this table compares total credits to the economy granted by the two banks.
Figure 3.5 illustrates the content of Table A2.6.

Between 1898 and 1910, total credit supplied by the Bank of Athens as a percentage of credits
to the economy by the National Bank fluctuated from 12 per cent to 92 per cent. By contrast,
from 1911 until 1916 credit provided by the Bank of Athens as a percentage of total credits by
the National Bank shrank rapidly. The Bank of Athens experienced widespread difficulties
after 1907, which climaxed with the outbreak of the First World War that led it to the verge of
bankruptcy. After 1907 total credit to the economy by the Bank of Athens as a percentage of
total credits granted by the National Bank fluctuated between 21 per cent and 60 per cent
displaying at the same time considerable volatility from year to year.
A comparison of short-term credits supplied by the two banks indicates that between
1904 and 1914, short-term credit provided by the Bank of Athens constantly surpassed short
term credit provided by the National Bank. During this period short-term credit by the Bank
of Athens in comparison with that of the National Bank ballooned. Subsequently, short-term
credit by the Bank of Athens remained persistently below that granted by the National Bank
until the end of the period in question. Credit by the Bank of Athens as a percentage of short
term credit supplied by the National Bank in 1919 was an outlier.
The comparison between credit granted by the Bank of Athens and the National Bank
carried out above demonstrates that the latter continued to dominate the credit market in
Greece on the eve of the banking reforms of the late 1920s. It also exposes differences in the
commercial aspect of the National Bank from that of other banks. Up to the end of the Great
War, mortgage credit dominated total credits to the economy provided by the National Bank
whilst by contrast, the handful of other Greek banks concentrated exclusively on short-term
credit. The Bank of Athens did not manage to undermine the position of the National Bank as
the most prominent commercial bank in Greece. It experienced initially, a rapid pace of
expansion of its business as it is shown in Tables A2.5 and A2.6 in Appendix A2 and in
Figure 3.5 above but it did not, however, manage to challenge successfully the status of the
National Bank as a commercial bank on the Greek market.
3.3. Deposits
3.3.1. Introduction
The sub-committee of the League of Nations that was preparing the central banking reforms
in Greece in late June 1927 recommended that the National Bank should wind up or transfer
all interest bearing activities including deposits to other banks. As an alternative, a new
commercial bank could be established to take over all the commercial activities of the
91


National Bank. By then, a principal tenet of central banking was that a central bank ‘should
not take monies at interest on its own account’.145 The governor of the National Bank,
Alexandros Diomides, however, centred his objections to the reforms by the League on
deposits. He was determined that the Bank maintain the right to accept interest bearing
deposits in any circumstances. He called the National Bank a pure ‘Banque de Depots’ and
was aware that his resolve not to divest the Bank of its right to receive interest bearing
deposits would lead to the collapse of a stabilisation plan under the auspices of the League of
Nations.146 It was inevitable that reform of the National Bank which would have restricted its
deposits to such non-interest bearing deposits as a central bank can generally accept would
have curtailed its predominance on the Greek commercial banking market and would in fact
have brought about its transformation into a fully fledged central bank.
On the eve of the outbreak of the First World War, the National Bank attracted nearly
63 per cent of the total commercial deposits gathered by all the banks in Greece as Table 3.8
below demonstrates. Government deposits that the National Bank held as a consequence of its
role as the bank of the government are not included. If the total deposits of a sample of the
four most prominent banks out of the seven joint stock banks that operated in Greece at the
time is examined, then the percentage share of the National Bank as a percentage of the total
deposits of these four banks increases to nearly 75 per cent. Nevertheless, Table 3.8
demonstrates unequivocally the hegemony of the National Bank on the deposit market in
Greece at the outbreak of the First World War. Furthermore, it indicates how uneven the
allocation of deposits amongst the big banks in Greece was with the National Bank taking the
greatest part of them. This was one of the most important characteristics of the banking
system in Greece that persisted throughout the entire interwar period, notwithstanding the
banking reforms of the late 1920s. The Bank of Athens managed to attract nearly 15 per cent
of the total deposits gathered at Greek banks at the time whilst the Popular and the
Commercial banks enjoyed a mere 5 and 3 per cent respectively.

2 This must be the total of deposits of the seven joint stock banks that operated in Greece at the time. These were the four banks mentioned in this table, plus the Bank of the Orient, the Ionian Bank and the Bank of Thessaloniki.
3 Figures for deposits other than those at the National Bank and the Bank of Athens may not be accurate.
Sources: Annual Report of the National Bank for 1914; Annual Report of the Bank of Athens for 1914; Charitakis (1932, p. 379); Kyrkilitsis (1934, p. 42); Kostis and Tsokopoulos (1988, pp. 182–196).
After the outbreak of the First World War the banking sector in Greece expanded rapidly with
the establishment of numerous, mainly local, undercapitalised banks. (See Table 3.1 above.)
As a result, the percentage share of the National Bank of the nation’s total deposits shrank. In
1926, approximately 41 per cent of these deposits were channelled to the National Bank as
Table 3.2 above indicates. Again government deposits held by the National Bank are not
included. Although the Bank of Athens had established a widespread network of branches, as
Table 3.1 shows, it only managed to garner approximately 14.50 per cent of total deposits in
1926, a percentage similar to that indicated in Table 3.8 for 1914. The Bank of Industry and
the Piraeus Bank, two of the most prominent of the newly established banks, collected almost
1.30 and 1 per cent respectively. Table 3.2 also implies that roughly one-quarter of total
deposits were directed to banks established after the outbreak of the Great War. Thus, Table
3.2 in conjunction with Table 3.1 suggests that the average percentage share of deposits at
each one of these primarily local banks, established after 1914, was considerably less than 1
per cent. These small, undercapitalised banks gathered mainly deposits from the local
community which took advantage of the high interest rates that they offered.147
147 Galanis (1946, p. 25).

M. S. Eulambio (1924, p. 178), writing in 1924, asserted that the ‘power of [the
National Bank] rested upon real wealth – the wealth of the whole nation’. He further added
that ‘one-half of the Bank’s deposits represent[ed] funds owned by Greeks living outside the
borders of the Greek Kingdom’. The claimed share of deposits from the Greek diaspora in the
total deposits of the National Bank that Eulambio suggested should be received with great
caution. His assertion does, however, show that confidence in the Bank was ‘unlimited’. Indeed
throughout its history as a bank of issue, the National Bank never experienced a run, despite
wars as well as turbulent political and economic conditions in Greece.
Deposits at the National Bank can be divided into two categories: deposits of the
government and deposits of other agencies as may be loosely called the commercial deposits.
Deposits of other agencies or commercial deposits or general deposits are terms that will be
used interchangeably in this thesis and will all refer to the same thing. Deposits of other
agencies consisted of sight, time and savings deposits.
The National Bank enjoyed certain privileges as a deposit bank vis-à-vis the other
banks in the country, which were vigorously protected during the central banking reform.
These privileges created a comparative advantage for the National Bank over the other banks.
For example, all legal entities deposited their surplus funds with the National Bank. Banks
also used to deposit their available funds at the Bank. After central banking reforms, the
National Bank retained the exclusive right to receive deposits from legal entities. An
agreement between the government and the National Bank signed in February 1928 allowed
the latter to gather exclusively all the surplus funds of legal entities right up to the end of
1950, in violation of the 1927 Geneva Protocol. The Protocol clearly stipulated that the
surplus funds of legal entities deposited at the National Bank should be transferred to the
newly established central bank.148 The literature has seen this as an attempt to protect the Old
Bank.
In this section of the thesis, deposits at the National Bank between 1898 and 1930 are
examined. Deposits are distinguished between government deposits and deposits of other
agencies and each category is examined separately to evaluate their significance for the Bank.
In this way, the ‘dual position’ of the National Bank as the bank of the government and at the
same time the most important ‘Banque de Depots’ in Greece is further illuminated.
148 For more, see Pyrsos (c1935, pp. 123–139); Kostis (1986, pp. 80–83); Pepelasis Minoglou (1993, pp. 178–179).

The main objective is to analyse the evolution of the National Bank as a ‘Banque de
Depots’ during the period in question. It will be shown that although the National Bank had
been the deposit bank of the government throughout its entire history as an issuing bank in
Greece it remained the predominant deposit bank on the eve of the banking reforms indicating
that it was not on the way to transforming itself into a fully fledged central bank of its own
volition. In spite of an increase in the number of commercial banks during the period in
question, the National Bank maintained its hegemony as a ‘Banque de Depots’ as Table 3.2
demonstrates and protected its ‘dual position’. The most important change that occurred was a
slow but continuous shift from time to sight deposits. At the beginning of the period, time
deposits accounted for the majority of total deposits at the National Bank, but as Table 3.11
illustrates, by the middle of the 1920s their share of the total deposits had decreased; by then
sight deposits made up the lion’s share, the outcome of a long period of war and monetary
upheaval. This change on the liabilities side of the balance sheet of the Bank was in tune with
changes in mortgage credit; mortgage credit granted by the National Bank was gradually
reduced after the outbreak of the Great War and as Table 3.7 above demonstrates, its
significance as an asset item diminished, again a result of a long period of war and high
inflation.
Firstly, deposits made by both the government and by other agencies are examined as
a percentage of the total deposits and liabilities of the Bank. Secondly, deposits at the
National Bank were estimated at 1911 values and in this way the impact of a long period of
war and monetary upheaval can be seen. Thirdly, the composition of general deposits into
sight, time and savings deposits is examined and changes are pinpointed. Finally, deposits of
other agencies at the National Bank are compared with deposits at the Bank of Athens the
second biggest bank in Greece.
As has been noted again and again because of the accountancy practices followed by
the National Bank in the 1920s, the value of figures denominated in gold drachmae that
appeared on its balance sheet was understated. A small portion of deposits, both government
and commercial deposits, were denominated in gold drachmae and were added together with
deposits in nominal drachmae. Here the same practice is followed in the hope that the
outcome paints a reasonably accurate picture. The fraction of deposits on the balance sheet of
the National Bank in gold drachmae was small as Tables A2.10 and A2.11 in Appendix A2
demonstrate.

3.3.2. Structure and evolution of deposits at the National Bank
The National Bank received deposits from the government and from the public in general
throughout its history as an issuing bank. Any balances after the service of government loans
were deposited at the National Bank. The IFC also deposited its funds at the Bank which also
accepted deposits from the public as if it were an ordinary commercial bank. Furthermore, all
state undertakings deposited their surplus funds exclusively with the National Bank. Banks
also deposited their available funds at the National Bank. All these privileges of tradition
created a comparative advantage to the National Bank in relation to other commercial banks
that operated in Greece.
Deposits, however, from legal entities as well as from other banks were not reported
separately. They were included with the deposits that an ordinary commercial bank accepts.
Galanis (1960, p. 13) maintained that the deposits of legal entities at the National Bank at the
point when the Bank of Greece was established were approximately one-tenth of the total
deposits in general at banks in Greece. Deposits made by other banks at the Athens and
Piraeus offices of the National Bank in 1926 were very volatile, fluctuating between 6 per
cent and 18 per cent of the total sight deposits of the National Bank.149 The interest rate paid
by the National Bank on both deposits by legal entities and by other banks was less than that
which it paid on the deposits of the general public.150

Notes: On the balance sheet of 1927 government deposits and deposits of other agencies were reported together. Government deposits and deposits of other agencies for 1927 was calculated using information provided by the governor of the National Bank in the annual report for that year. Source: Author’s calculations using the data in Table A2.7 in Appendix A2.
Table 3.9 shows deposits made by the government and those of other agencies as a percentage
of the total deposits of the National Bank between 1898 and 1930. It clearly demonstrates that
deposits of other agencies dominated throughout the period in question. Furthermore, as
commercial deposits at the Bank increased, the share of government deposits decreased.
97


Government deposits at the Bank were also very volatile, fluctuating severely from year to
year as is demonstrated in Table A2.7 in Appendix A2 which presents government deposits,
deposits of other agencies and total deposits at the National Bank during the period in
question.
Some years, namely 1899, 1902, 1911 and 1918 stand out as outliers. During these
years government deposits were unusually high mainly because of government borrowing.
Government deposits in 1927 also appear to be an outlier. Table A2.7 shows that government
deposits increased considerably during that year. In 1927 the National Bank changed the
format of its balance sheet and government deposits were reported together with deposits of
other agencies. The governor of the Bank in his annual report presented commercial deposits
separately without, however, making any reference to government deposits.151 This
information was used here to separate government deposits and commercial deposits from the
total deposits of the National Bank. Nevertheless, this abrupt increase in government deposits
in 1927 cannot be explained and should be received with caution.
In the early years of the twentieth century, government deposits dropped from
approximately 25 per cent of the total deposits of the National Bank to 12.50 per cent.
Between 1908 and 1923, government deposits remained below 10 per cent of the total
deposits of the National Bank, fluctuating between 2.42 per cent and 9.60 per cent if one
excludes 1911 and 1918 which, as mentioned above, are both exceptional years. In 1924, the
share of government deposits increased to approximately 14 per cent whilst at the end of 1926
they still accounted for nearly 12.50 per cent.
Thus, the main characteristics of government deposits at the National Bank at this
time are: firstly, their volatility from year to year and secondly their somewhat insignificant
share in the total deposits. This is verified by Table 3.10 which presents both government and
commercial deposits as a percentage of total liabilities of the National Bank. Table 3.10
further shows total deposits at the Bank as a percentage of its liabilities.

Sources: Tables A2.1 and A2.7 in Appendix A2.
Both Tables 3.9 and 3.10 show that deposits of other agencies – that is to say deposits of the
general public and other deposits that the National Bank attracted as a consequence of its
privileged position, for example deposits from legal entities and other commercial banks 
remained important for the Bank throughout the period in question. In 1900, nearly one-fifth
of the total liabilities consisted of deposits of other agencies. By the outbreak of the First
World War, general deposits represented approximately 40 per cent of its total liabilities.
During this period, deposits of other agencies experienced a continuous increase both in
nominal and at 1911 values as Tables A2.7 and A2.8 show. The year 1909 appears to have
been an exception. Subsequently, deposits of other agencies as a percentage of the liabilities
of the National Bank dropped. This decrease in deposits of other agencies as a percentage of
its liabilities was, however, due for the most part to the expansion of the balance sheet of the
National Bank following an increase in the banknotes in circulation.
99


Table 3.10 also illustrates the profound change that the banking reforms brought to
the National Bank: after the establishment of the Bank of Greece, the National Bank was
indeed transformed into a pure ‘Banque de Depots’. Following the loss of the issuing privilege,
deposits accounted for over 70 per cent of the Bank’s liabilities.
Table A2.8 in Appendix A2 shows deposits at the National Bank at 1911 prices. This
table also presents commercial deposits at 1911 values, expressed as a ratio. Commercial
deposits expressed as a ratio are illustrated in Figure 3.6.
Figure 3.6: Deposits of other agencies at 1911 prices (1911=100) Source: Table A2.8 in Appendix A2.
Figure 3.6 and Table A2.8 show that deposits of other agencies at 1911 values increased
steadily up to the outbreak of the First World War. During this period, deposits were boosted
in particular by remittances from Greek emigrants to the USA. This rise in the deposits at the
National Bank is also demonstrated in Tables 3.9 and 3.10 and occurred during a period when
the Bank experienced constant expansion.
After the outbreak of the Great War deposits at the National Bank remained high. A
noticeable decrease in the deposits of other agencies at 1911 prices occurred only during the
active participation of Greece in the war when inflation rates were soaring. Subsequently,
during the Asia Minor campaign deposits remained high. They reached even higher levels
than those on the eve of the outbreak of the First World War. After the Asia Minor debacle,
however, deposits at constant values decreased to close to their 1911 levels. In 1925, when the

National Bank experienced serious liquidity problems, deposits sank to their lowest level
since 1911. In fact in 1925, deposits at nominal prices even fell by nearly 12 per cent from the
year before as Table A2.7 demonstrates. Two years later the Mortgage Bank was established
and the National Bank passed on to this new institution time deposits of a nominal value of
562 million drachmae which represented two-thirds of the time deposits reported in December
1926.152
After the National Bank had lost its issuing privilege it became a pure ‘Banque de
Depots’. In 1928, as Figure 3.6 and Tables A2.7 and A2.8 show, deposits increased remarkably
both at nominal drachmae and at 1911 prices whilst inflation remained very low. After the
stabilisation of the drachma all banks were obliged by law to use the stabilisation rate to update
all their assets and liabilities denominated in gold drachmae or foreign exchange.153 This
suggests that deposits reported on the balance sheet of the National Bank in the 1920s were to
some extent understated. The same can be said of all banks as an abrupt increase in deposits
reported on their balance sheet after the stabilisation is observed. See, for example, Table A2.12
where deposits at the Bank of Athens are presented.
The first signs of distress in the banking sector appeared in 1929. Firstly, a bank
founded in 1923, the Anglo-American Bank, went bankrupt and a few months later the Bank
of Thessaly, established in 1921, suspended payments.154 As a result deposits fled mainly
from medium size banks that were considered weak to large banks and in particular to the
National Bank.155 In this way the difficulties being experienced by the banking sector because
of the stabilisation of the Greek currency and/or the Great Depression further enhanced the
position of the National Bank as the most important ‘Banque de Depots’ in Greece.

Table A2.9 in Appendix A2 presents commercial deposits of the National Bank at nominal
prices between 1898 and 1930 divided into sight, time and savings deposits whilst Table 3.11
shows each category of deposits as a percentage share of the total commercial deposits at the
National Bank.
102


Table 3.11 above demonstrates that time deposits had the lion’s share of the total
deposits of other agencies at the National Bank more or less up to the outbreak of the Great
War. Between 1898 and 1910 over 70 per cent of total general deposits were time deposits.
After 1910, time deposits’ share of total deposits began decreasing and in 1916, for the first
time during the period in question and possibly during the entire history of the National Bank
as a bank of issue, they accounted for less than 50 per cent of its total deposits. In 1923, time
deposits shrank even more as a result of new legislation passed to combat exchange rate
instability and at the same time to provide foreign exchange to the government.156 Table 3.11
demonstrates that with the establishment of the Mortgage Bank the share of time deposits
dropped below 10 per cent during that year, whilst on the other hand, the share of sight
deposits in total deposits of the National Bank experienced a constant increase during the
entire period in question. By 1927, nearly 66 per cent of the total deposits of the National
Bank were sight deposits. The share of savings in the total deposits increased steadily until the
end of the First World War. In the early 1920s, however, that share fell.
Table 3.11 combined with Table 3.7 which presents the percentage share of each
category of commercial credits to the economy demonstrates the nature of the National Bank
as a commercial bank before the central banking reform. At the beginning of the period in
question and until at least the outbreak of the Great War, the National Bank in spite of the fact
that it was the issuing bank in Greece, clearly specialised in mortgage credit. Both tables
show that the National Bank was heavily involved in long-term activities; mortgage loans and
time deposits. It was the long period of war and monetary upheaval together with the
establishment of the Mortgage Bank which led the National Bank to focus primarily on short
to medium-term activities. This shift in the nature of its commercial activities, however, does
not indicate that the National Bank was evolving of its own volition into a pure central bank
following the model of other European banks of issue. It indicates that the commercial
banking sector in Greece was moving towards specialisation.
3.3.3. A comparison of deposits at the National Bank and the Bank of Athens
Although Tables 3.2 and 3.8 demonstrate that the National Bank was the most important
deposit bank in Greece throughout the period, a further attempt is made to establish the status
of the National Bank as a deposit bank on the Greek market. This time, the deposits at the
Bank of Athens, the second most important bank in Greece, are compared with deposits of
other agencies at the National Bank during the entire period in question. The Bank of Athens
was founded in 1893 as a pure bank of deposits and for this reason it established very rapidly
156 Annual Report of the National Bank for 1923 (1924, pp. XXIII–XXIV); Tsalikis (1923, pp. 30–32).
103


a widespread network of branches. In addition, it operated beyond the Greek borders, in areas
with thriving Greek diaspora communities. All deposits, however, irrespective of their origin
were reported together on the balance sheet published by the Bank of Athens every year.
By means of comparison, Table A2.13 and Figure 3.7 present deposits of the Bank of
Athens as a percentage of the National Bank. This comparison aims to evaluate further the
position as well as the evolution of the National Bank as the principal deposit bank in Greece.
Figure 3.7: Deposits at the Bank of Athens as a percentage of the National Bank’s general deposits Source: Table A2.13 in Appendix A2.
Figure 3.7 demonstrates that deposits at the Bank of Athens increased rapidly up to 1910
making the Bank of Athens a serious competitor to the National Bank. In fact during this
period deposits at the Bank of Athens increased more rapidly than commercial deposits at the
National Bank. The difficulties that the Bank of Athens experienced between 1911 and 1916
are clearly demonstrated in Figure 3.7, as well as in Tables A2.12 and A2.13.157 In 1915,
deposits at the Bank of Athens as a percentage of deposits at the National Bank hit their
lowest level dropping to approximately 16 per cent of the total commercial deposits at the
National Bank. Subsequently, after the Bank of Athens had been reorganised, its deposits as a
percentage of commercial deposits at the National Bank increased as is demonstrated above in
Figure 3.7. This increase was not sustained for long. In the early 1920s, deposits at the Bank
of Athens as a percentage of total deposits of other agencies at the National Bank dropped and
157 For the problems that the Bank of Athens faced between 1911 and 1916 as well as the attempts that were made at its reorganisation see Kostis and Tsokopoulos (1988, pp. 42–52).

then again rose following the end of the Asia Minor debacle. In 1928, after the stabilisation of
the drachma when these comparisons become more credible because all banks had to revalue
their assets and liabilities using the stabilisation price of the drachma, deposits at the Bank of
Athens accounted for nearly 47 per cent of the deposits at the National Bank.
During the period in question, deposits at the National Bank evolved according to the
general economic and monetary conditions in Greece. The Bank maintained its hegemony in
the deposit market in Greece throughout its entire history as a dual-purpose bank. In June
1927, when the Greek representatives made an official request of the Financial Committee of
the League of Nations to support the de jure stabilisation of the drachma, the National Bank
was still a strong commercial institution which at the same time enjoyed note issuing
privileges. During the period in question the National Bank had shifted its focus from long
term to short- and medium-term activities, as Tables 3.7 and 3.11 demonstrate. This shift was
further consolidated with the establishment of the Mortgage Bank in 1927.
3.4. Interest rates
3.4.1. Interest rates on credits to the economy
Research on interest rates in Greece before the outbreak of the Second World War is limited
to fleeting references in the literature in spite of their importance for economic growth. In this
section of the thesis, an overview of interest rates, mainly those of the National Bank both for
loans to the economy and for deposits is attempted using information from primary as well as
secondary sources.
Table 3.12 and Figure 3.8 show changes in the discount rate of the National Bank
during the period in question. The change in the discount rate in December 1928 was made by
the newly established central bank, the Bank of Greece.158
158 Although autonomy in its purest form was incorporated in the statutes of the Bank of Greece, a few months after its establishment the Prime Minister began pressing for a reduction in its discount rate, which was hardly justified by economic conditions. This intervention was neither approved by Horace C. Finlayson, the foreign advisor to the Bank of Greece, nor Otto Niemeyer who continued to monitor closely developments in Greece. On 2 December, the discount rate was, however, reduced from 10 per cent to nine per cent – a reduction that remains controversial. For example see Zolotas (1929, pp. 196197); Kyrkilitsis (1934, p. 166); and Loberdos (1936, pp. 54–55). As this example indicates, even the statutes of the Bank of Greece together with foreign supervision could not safeguard its independence. It also needed a political consensus or at least a sufficient degree of political support to be able to maintain a position of independence.

Table 3.13 below shows the rate charged by the National Bank for loans to farmers,
agricultural co-operatives and unions of agricultural co-operatives. These loans were mainly
for farming and were usually of a period between six and nine months. Interest rates for
agrarian credit were fixed by law and, as the table below indicates were rarely changed
despite the turbulent economic and monetary conditions in the country.

Notes:
(1) The laws ΒΩΞ ́ of 18 March 1903 and 656 of 20 February 1915 were milestones for credit granted for farming by the National Bank during the period in question. The 1903 law provided for a decrease in the rate charged to 6 per cent after 1 January 1905. At the same time the National Bank agreed to increase credit to agriculture to 21 million drachmae. In 1915, the Bank undertook to increase loans for farming to 25 million drachmae. In addition, preference had to be given to co-operatives and unions of co-operatives where the rate had to be 5 per cent or below. (2) In November 1925, a decree provided that the rate of the National Bank for farming loans could not be higher than the discount rate. The same decree stipulated that the rate for loans to co-operatives had to be at least 1 per cent lower than the discount rate and to unions of cooperatives at least 0.50 per cent lower than the rate charged on farming loans to co-operatives.

Legislation related to agricultural credit that was passed in 1903, 1915 and 1925 determined
interest rates for agrarian loans during the period in question. The 1903 law allowed for a
reduction in the interest rate for farming loans to 6 per cent that became effective on 1
January 1905. Subsequently, in 1915 when the issuing privilege of the National Bank was
extended to the newly annexed areas after the end of the Balkan Wars, the Bank agreed to
increase credit to the agricultural sector from the 21 million drachmae provided for by the law
of 1903 to 25 million drachmae. In addition, preference had to be given to agrarian co
operatives which enjoyed a lower rate by one hundred basis points than individual farmers
who continued to pay 6 per cent. In November 1925, the interest for farming loans was linked
to the discount rate. A decree provided that the interest rate for loans by the National Bank to
farmers could not be higher than the discount rate. The same decree also stipulated that the
rate for loans to co-operatives had to be at least 1 per cent lower than the discount rate and to
107


unions of co-operatives at least 0.50 per cent lower than the rate charged on farming loans to
co-operatives.159
The interest rate for mortgage credit was also determined by law. A piece of 1925
legislation which aimed at regulating mortgage credit, linked the mortgage rate to the yield of
bonds issued to finance mortgage loans and to the deposit rate. It was stipulated that the
difference between the mortgage rate and the yield of mortgage bonds or the deposit rate
could not be more than two percentage points. Previously, the custom was that legislation
specified a ceiling for the mortgage rate.160

Notes:
(1) The law that was introduced in 1925 to regulate mortgage credit linked the mortgage rate to the yield of bonds issued to finance mortgage loans and to the deposit rate. It was stipulated that the difference between the mortgage rate and the yield of mortgage bonds or the deposit rate could not be more than two percentage points. Previously, the law specified a ceiling for the mortgage rate. (2) Circular No. 47 of 23 June 1926 referred to mortgage credit granted to legal entities. The rate specified for mortgage loans to legal entities was the same as that for mortgage credit to the general public.

In addition to discounts, agricultural credit and mortgage loans, the National Bank provided
loans against merchandise and securities. The rate for loans against merchandise and
securities usually followed changes in the other interest rates. For example, in May 1920 the
rate for loans against merchandise and securities increased from 6 per cent to 6.50 per cent.161
Then, in December 1922 the rate for loans both against merchandise and securities was raised

to 8 per cent.162 In September 1925, the rate for loans against merchandise was increased
again, this time to 11 per cent.163 There were, however, exceptions to the general rate charged
against merchandise; for example when tobacco and raisins were used as collateral then the
interest rate charged was different.164
The rate charged for credits to the economy was usually increased by 1 per cent when
loans were renewed. The evidence to hand shows that commission was charged when credit
was granted against securities and merchandise. Furthermore, available evidence shows that
lower rates were charged by the headquarters of the National Bank for some loans against
merchandise and securities, and in other flourishing urban centres, than in the rest of the
country.165
Table 3.12 above shows that the discount rate of the National Bank was raised to 11
per cent in the 1920s whilst the discount rate of other banks was 15 per cent. At the same
time, interest rates on the unofficial credit market fluctuated between 20 and 25 per cent.166
This noticeable difference between the rates charged for loans by banks and on the unofficial
credit market was not a result of the monetary upheaval experienced after the end of the Great
War. Neither was it a product of the liquidity problems that the credit market faced in the
mid-1920s.
As would be expected when the National Bank was established in 1841 an unofficial
credit market existed.167 Informal credit networks that had already developed by the mid
nineteenth century continued to operate alongside the formal banking sector for more than a
century after this. These informal credit networks consisted of merchants, ship-owners,
insurance companies, landowners, credit offices and local money lenders and operated
alongside the formal banking institutions. A system of ‘chain finance’ was created whereby
the National Bank lent ‘to the most creditworthy who in turn, lent to others on a descending

164 In 1925, the rate charged for loans granted against tobacco was 12 per cent; that is to say it was one per cent higher than the general rate for loans against merchandise. For more, see ibid., p. 7.
165 Circular No. 51 of 16 May 1920 referred to a rate increase for a particular type of loans against merchandise and securities from six to six and a half per cent in Athens, Piraeus, Patras, Corfu, Syra, Volos, Zakynthos, Salonika and Smyrna. For the rest of the country it was raised from six and a half per cent to seven per cent.

scale of creditworthiness’.168 This ‘chain finance’ system which still survived during the
period in question kept interest rates at exorbitant levels.169
A conservative and risk-averse National Bank did not challenge the informal credit
networks that operated but instead did business with them, as they could provide high quality
collateral and were low risk and creditworthy customers. Thomadakis (1981, pp. 353–354)
showed that the clientele of the National Bank between 1873 and 1884 included bankers and
usurers.170 Research, however, on the relationship between the banking sector and the non
banking credit system remains limited.171 The literature has not so far tackled crucial
questions related to the National Bank and the cost of capital in Greece. Could the National
Bank in fact have challenged effectively informal credit networks in Greece during the ‘long’
nineteenth century? This is a question that only future research will answer.
‘Chain finance’ on the one hand, and on the other the fact that legislation determined
the interest rates for agricultural and mortgage credit, indicate that the use of the discount rate
of the National Bank was not effective as a monetary policy instrument.
3.4.2. Interest rates on deposits
Table 3.15 shows interest rates paid by the National Bank on deposits in the 1920s. The rate
for sight deposits at the National Bank fluctuated between 1 per cent and 4 cent in the 1920s.
At the same time, banks and bankers enjoyed lower interest rates for their sight deposits at the
National Bank than those cited in Table 3.15. Between July 1909 and December 1919, the
interest rate for sight deposits at the Bank was 1 per cent and before 1909 it had even been
zero.
168 Thomadakis (1985, p. 66).
169 For a general description of this ‘chain finance’ system, see Franghiadis (2007, pp. 60–66). For a more detailed analysis of the credit lines between export merchants, local money lenders and small farmers, mainly related to currant viticulture in southern Greece between 1830 and 1893, see Franghiadis (1990, pp. 130–143). See also Petzmezas (2003, pp. 94–105). In a nutshell, export merchants lent to local money lenders who in turn were obliged to deliver currant fruit to them. Subsequently, local money lenders lent growers who repaid them with currants. Export merchants had access to the official credit system in Greece or could easily borrow from abroad. They usually charged local money lenders 12 per cent, whilst the money lenders charged small farmers on loans against promised deliveries of currant fruit 20 per cent and 24 per cent. The interest rate charged on loans to small farmers when other kind of crops were involved could rise to 30 per cent or even 40 per cent. However, very little is known about the informal credit networks relating to crops other than currants. Research so far has been focused primarily on the way that the production of currant fruit was financed as it was the most important export good during the nineteenth century.

Notes:
1 Between July 1909 and December 1919, the rate for sight deposits was in general 1 per cent whilst previously it had been zero.
2 The interest rate for time deposits varied between 1.25 and 4 per cent depending on the period of maturity. In 1920, a savings account was limited to 3,000 drachmae.
3 Banks and bankers enjoyed lower sight deposit rates than the general public in the 1920s. For example, in 1920 the sight deposit rate for banks and bankers remained at 1 per cent. Then, in August 1923 it was further decreased to 0.50 per cent and in May 1924 it became 0.25 per cent. The rate for sight deposits of banks and bankers was later increased and remained at 1 per cent until the end of July 1927. On 1 August 1927 it was again decreased to 0.50 per cent.
4 This rate was for a period of up to six months.
5 The interest rate for time deposits fluctuated between 3.25 per cent and 7 per cent in February 1925 depending on the period of maturity. It was 3.25 per cent for time deposits of up to six months, 3.5 for up to one year, 4 per cent for up to two years, 5 per cent for up to four years, 6 per cent for up to five years and 7 per cent for up ten years and beyond.
6 In February 1925, savings accounts were limited to 10,000 drachmae or 400 sterling, or 2,000 dollars or 10,000 French Francs. In November of that same year the interest rate for savings increased to 5 per cent and at the same time the limit for a savings account raised to 50,000 drachmae.
7 After November 1925, the interest for time deposits varied between 4.25 per cent and 7 per cent. It was 4.25 per cent for time deposits for up to six months, 4.50 for up to one year, 5 per cent for up to two years, 5.50 per cent for up to 4 years, 6 per cent for up to five years and 7 per cent for up to ten years and perpetual deposits.
8 In 1927, the rate for government deposits was set at 1 per cent whilst for legal entities it varied between 1 and 3 per cent. The rate for deposits of tobacco companies was 2 per cent.

Table 3.16 shows interest rates on deposits advertised by banks in the Athens Economist in
1921 and 1926. This table indicates that other banks tended to offer higher deposit rates than
the National Bank. In addition, it demonstrates that the sight deposit rate of the National Bank
and other big banks converged in the middle of the 1920s, a result of the credit conditions in
Greece at the time. This table also indicates that small local banks established after the
outbreak of the Great War tended to pay higher rates to attract customers. The depositors at
111


these small banks were usually locals, acquaintances of their directors who at the same time
played the role of a creditor to these provincial banks.172

(2) The rate given in 1921 for time deposits referred to time deposits of a period of maturity of one year. (3) In January 1921, savings accounts of the Commercial Bank were limited to 4,000 drachmae and of the Bank of Industry to 5,000 drachmae. (4) In January 1926, the rate of time deposits given is for a period of one year. In December 1926, the rate advertised by the Bank of the Orient was for a maturity period of six months. This bank offered a 6 per cent rate for time deposits of a two-year period. The Ionian and the Panhellenic banks did not specify any period for the time deposit rate advertised. (5) In 1926, the rates advertised for savings applied to a variety of different accounts. For example, the Bank of Industry offered a saving account for up to 10,000 drachmae, the General Bank for up to 15,000 drachmae, the Bank of Athens for up to 30,000 thousand drachmae whilst Pavlos’ Bank, the Bank of the National Economy and the Panhellenic Bank offered accounts for up to 75,000 drachmae. The American Express limited its savings account to 100,000 drachmae. Neither the Ionian Bank nor the Bank of Piraeus specified the size of their savings account.

3.4.3. Concluding remarks
A comparison between the rates charged for loans and paid for deposits provides striking
evidence of the lack of competitiveness of the Greek banking system. In addition, the
persistence of credit facilities other than banking and the charge of shadow interest rates in
spite of the increase in the number of banks after the end of the Great War indicate the
backwardness of the credit market in Greece.
The spread between the discount rate and the rate for sight deposits at the National
Bank fluctuated between four and a half and 7 per cent. The discount rate of other banks
moderately varied between 11 and 15 per cent during the period in question which points to a
considerable spread between the interest rate charged for discounts and the rate paid for sight
deposits.173 This considerable spread between loan and deposit interest rates is convincing
evidence indicating the lack of competitiveness of the banking system in Greece.
Greek banks were regarded as profitable.174 An indication of their profitability is the
spread between the rates of their loans and deposits. The tables presented in this section
indicate a comfortable difference between the loan and deposit interest rates of the National
Bank. This difference was increased when credit was renewed or when commission was
added. The next section of this chapter deals with the financial position and strength of the
National Bank during the period in question.
3.5. Profit and loss statements
3.5.1. Some thoughts on the profitability of the National Bank
The National Bank published an income statement twice a year, in June and December
throughout its entire history as a bank of issue. After the central banking reforms it published
an income statement only once a year, in December. These income statements provide ample
information on revenue, expenses, net profits as well as data on dividend paid to shareholders
each semester. On occasions, its governors acknowledged that the Bank retained unpublished
profits, a practice that was not uncommon in banking institutions at the time.175 Nevertheless,
173 The Scottish banking system of the nineteenth century is regarded as highly competitive. The spread between loan and deposit interest rates was typically only one to two percentage points. See White (1999, p. 83).
174 Kyrkilitsis (1934, pp. 47–53).
175 Annual Report of the National Bank for 1921 (1922, p. XXI); Annual Report of the National Bank for 1922 (1923, p. XXVII); See, for example, Cassis (1994) Chapter 5 for a general discussion on the unpublished profits of various banks at the time.
113


these profit and loss statements still provide a wide range of information that can be used to
assess the financial position of the National Bank.
Kostis and Kostelenos (2003) used these profit and loss statements to estimate risk
indicators and performance ratios for the National Bank between 1897 and 1940.176 An
examination of these financial ratios leads to the following observations. Firstly, the financial
ratios estimated indicate that the National Bank, a privately owned institution, had adopted a
conservative attitude towards risk. Secondly, the results that the financial ratios yield for the
period between 1928 and 1940 when the National Bank operated as a purely commercial
bank, are much as theory would lead to expect. By contrast, both the risk indicators and
performance ratios that refer to the period that the National Bank acted as a dual-purpose
bank, did not always provide the results that theory would suggest. Finally, the financial ratios
estimated imply that the late 1920s may have marked a watershed in the evolution of the
National Bank.
When total assets is used to calculate a financial ratio for the period that the National
Bank served as a dual-purpose bank then the result may not be what theory suggests. For
example, both return on assets and the liquidity multiplier estimated by Kostis and Kostelenos
(2003) indicate that the performance of the National Bank between 1910 and 1919 was not
the one expected by theory. In addition, the liquidity multiplier shows that risk for the
National Bank increased during this period. The authors argue that this deterioration in the
performance of the Bank was due to an increase in the price level between 1910 and 1919.
For the estimation of both ratios total assets are needed: total assets are used in the
denominator to calculate return on assets and in the nominator when the liquidity multiplier is
calculated. Between 1910 and 1919, however, the National Bank experienced a rapid increase
in total assets and consequently total liabilities, primarily because of the operation of the
ΓΧΜΒ Law. This expansion of the balance sheet of the National Bank was entirely a result of
its role as an issuing bank.
Profitability measures and other financial ratios such as those estimated by Kostis and
Kostelenos (2003) are simple measures that are used to examine the economic performance of
banks and companies. The National Bank was a complex private institution that combined
public responsibilities with commercial activities. It is difficult for these financial ratios to
176 See the CD included in Kostis in collaboration with Kostelenos (2003). They estimated the following risk indicators: liquidity risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, capital risk and solvency risk. Whilst the performance ratios estimated are return on equity and assets, liquidity multiplier, profit margin and asset utilisation.
114


reflect the fact that the National Bank was a dual-purpose bank that operated during complex
historical conditions.
As the authors themselves noted, the financial ratios that they estimated indicate that
the performance of the National Bank, a privately owned institution, which for most of the
period that they examined combined public responsibilities with commercial activities was
rational. The question that they pose is if indeed maximisation of profits was a priority of its
governors given the historical conditions during the period that they examine. They add that if
the priority of the administration of the National Bank was not to maximise its profitability
then tools such as those used to evaluate the performance of commercial banks may not be
appropriate to the case.
A rational question that is posed is to what extent the public responsibilities of the
National Bank curbed its profitability as a commercial bank. At the same time, however, it
could be argued that its privileges as the central bank in Greece enhanced its profitability. The
National Bank remained a financially strong institution throughout its entire history as a dual
purpose bank. Its financial strength was a result of the way that its governors balanced the two
conceptions of their business: ‘duty to the proprietors’ as a commercial bank and on the other
hand ‘duty to the public’ as a bank of issue – two responsibilities that could at times conflict.
The National Bank’s financial strength was based on its market power and its ability
to select high quality assets and liabilities which resulted in its enduring profitability and
solvency. In this thesis, the term profitability does not necessarily mean that the aim of its
management was the maximisation of profits, despite the fact that the National Bank was a
private institution. The good quality of its assets and liabilities given the constraints under
which it operated was more important for its conservative and risk-averse governors than
maximisation of profits per se in the conventional sense of the term. A great number of the
assets and liabilities of the National Bank were related to the monopolies and privileges that it
enjoyed. Furthermore, its policy as a commercial bank was to lend against a variety of good
collateral, to low risk, creditworthy customers from its establishment in 1842 to the end of the
period in question.
3.5.2. Composition of the revenue of the National Bank
The National Bank’s revenue came from interest charged on credits granted to the economy;
from holding public debt and foreign exchange reserves deposited abroad; from owning
property and shares of other banks and companies; from renting safe deposits and keeping
115


securities and bonds for its customers. Income statements also included an entry entitled
revenue resulting ‘From different profits’. The source of revenue included in this entry was
specified only in 1920. The profit and loss statement of December 1920 stated that revenue
‘From different profits’ was comprised of revenue from foreign exchange differences,
commission on capital movements and other profits in general.

In Table 3.17 above, the revenue of the National Bank has been grouped into six categories.
The percentage share of each category in the total income of the National Bank has then been
estimated. All earnings from interest charged on credits granted to the economy were gathered
together and their percentage share of the total earnings is given in the first column of Table
3.17. Revenue from public debt owned by the National Bank was grouped into two categories
whenever possible, depending on the information provided by the income statements: income
from public debt traded on stock exchanges and income from illiquid public debt held by the
National Bank as a consequence of its role as a central bank. The fourth column of Table 3.17
presents the percentage share of the revenue of the National Bank which is related to foreign
exchange reserves deposited abroad. The fifth column refers to earnings from what was called
‘Different profits’. Finally, the last column, entitled ‘Sundry’, includes earnings from
property, shares of banks and companies that the National Bank owned and other income
derived from miscellaneous sources.
It should be noted that Table 3.17 does not demonstrate if income from a particular
category increased or decreased during the period in question. If this table is compared with
tables in chapters three and four that present the evolution of commercial credits and public
debt then it could be inferred implicitly if revenue from credits granted to the economy or
public debt held by the National Bank increased or decreased.
Between the enactment of the Law of Control and the outbreak of the First Balkan
War the main bulk of the revenue of the National Bank came from credits supplied to
different sectors of the economy. During this period revenue from interest rates charged on
credits supplied to the economy fluctuated between 56 per cent and 69 per cent of total
income of the National Bank. Revenues from public debt take second place. Earnings from
public debt traded on stock exchanges, as Table 3.17 demonstrates, constituted the majority of
the income from public debt; between 13 per cent and 25 per cent of total income stemmed
from public debt traded on stock exchanges. On the other hand, between 4 per cent and 12 per
cent of total income resulted from bilateral government debt in spite of the fact that it
composed a significant item in the total assets of the National Bank as Table 4.6 in Chapter 4
demonstrates.
The percentage share of income derived from foreign exchange reserves deposited
abroad was increasing between 1898 and 1911. Revenue from foreign exchange reserves
increased from 2 per cent in 1900 to 16 per cent of total revenue in 1911. In fact, in 1911
revenue from foreign exchange reserves surpassed those from public debt traded on stock
exchanges for the first time during the period in question. The share of revenue from foreign
118


exchange reserves as a percentage of total revenue indicates that the National Bank was
increasing its foreign exchange reserves during this period. In addition, the introduction of the
ΓΧΜΒ Law in 1910 helped the Bank to further augment its reserves in foreign exchange;
indeed in 1912, earnings from foreign exchange reserves became the second most important
source of income with revenue from total public debt in third place.
Between the Balkan Wars and the Asia Minor debacle the importance of the different
sources of income of the National Bank altered, mirroring changes in its balance sheet. The
picture drawn during this period is not consistent. Up to the point of the active participation of
Greece in the Great War, earnings from credits to the economy continued to be the most
important source of income. Subsequently, between 1917 and 1922 revenue from either
foreign exchange or total public debt became the most important source of income for the
National Bank.
In 1920, the percentage share of income from ‘different profits’ swelled noticeably.
As Table 6.2 in Chapter 6 indicates, 1920 was the first year of considerable foreign exchange
instability in Greece. This, coupled with the information provided by profit and loss
statements, that is to say that ‘Different profits’ also includes earnings from foreign exchange
dealings indicating that the National Bank most likely speculated on the foreign exchange
market at the time.177
After the end of the Asia Minor campaign, credits to the economy were once more the
most important source of income for the National Bank. Revenue from ‘different profits’
continued to be considerable before stabilisation, competing with earnings from total public
debt for second place.
After de jure stabilisation, when the National Bank operated as a purely commercial
bank, nearly 70 per cent of its income, as Table 3.17 shows, derived from credits supplied to
the economy. Public debt remained the second most important source of income but this time
it represented only a small fraction of its total earnings.
Thus, credits to the economy provided the lion’s share of the income of the National
Bank. During the long period of war and monetary upheaval, however, credits to the economy
did not always constitute the most important source of revenue. This change was a product of
177 See statements of profits and losses between 1920 and 1930. See also Kostis (2003, p. 172).

exceptional historical conditions and not the result of a deliberate policy on the part of the
National Bank.
3.5.3. Evolution of revenue, expenses and dividend of the National Bank
Figure 3.9 demonstrates the way in which the total revenue of the National Bank at constant
1911 prices evolved between 1898 and 1930. This figure indicates that revenue of the
National Bank at constant prices increased until the outbreak of the Great War. (See also
Table A2.18 in Appendix A2.) Subsequently, revenue fell until the Armistice. Figure 3.9 also
shows that during the Asia Minor campaign, revenue increased spectacularly. Indeed income
at constant prices in 1921 and 1922 reached unusually high levels that had not been reached
before, during the period in question, and were surpassed only in 1930. After 1923, the
National Bank’s earnings fluctuated. They remained, however, above their 1911 level and in
fact after 1925 income at constant prices exceeded its 1914 level.
Figure 3.9: Revenue of the National Bank at 1911 prices, 1898–1930 (1911=100) Source: Table A2.18 in Appendix A2.
An examination of revenue alone reveals very little about the financial position of the
National Bank. Therefore, the evolution of expenses is also examined and compared with the
development of revenue. Figure 3.10 shows the expenses of the National Bank at constant
prices. It demonstrates that expenses increased until the outbreak of the First World War.
Then, they decreased until the Armistice, following the same pattern as revenue. In the 1920s,
expenses fluctuated considerably but remained above their 1911 level.

It should be noted that revenue increased faster than expenses before the outbreak of the
Balkan Wars and between 1921 and 1922. However, during the rest of the period the rate of
increase in expenses was faster than the rate of increase in revenue. In the 1920s, the rise in
expenses was mainly due to an increase in personnel cost as the number of staff increased as
well as the number of branches that the Bank operated.
Figure 3.11 and Table A2.19 in Appendix A2 compares expenses with the revenue of
the National Bank. It shows expenses as a percentage of revenue during the period in
question. Expenses of the National Bank as a percentage of revenue increased considerably
between 1905 and 1919. In addition, between 1923 and the end of the period in question,
expenses as a percentage of revenue fluctuated between 80 and 85 per cent, a percentage
share higher than that observed before the Balkan Wars.

Figure 3.12 shows the evolution of net profits of the National Bank at constant 1911 prices
between the enactment of the Law of Control and stabilisation. It demonstrates that net profits
increased until 1904. Subsequently, they remained stable until the end of the Balkan Wars, a
fact that points to the conservative character of the National Bank. During the Great War net
profits decreased. By contrast, between 1920 and 1923 the National Bank’s profits were
generally high. This short time-span also appears to be an outlier in figures related to revenue.
During those three years the National Bank enjoyed extraordinarily high earnings which, to a
great extent, stemmed from unpublished profits. Legislation related to the National Bank and
passed in 1920, encouraged the publication of unpublished profits from previous years.178
Subsequently, net profits remained close to their 1911 level and after the banking reforms the
trend seems to be upward.

Net profit margin or ratio, that is to say net profits as a percentage of revenue, has been
calculated and presented in Figure 3.13 and Table A2.22. The percentage share of net profits
in the National Bank’s revenue decreased to below 20 per cent after 1912 reaching a very low
level in 1918 and 1919. As expected, in 1921 and 1922, the net profit margin was unusually
high. After 1924, it dropped again and remained below 20 per cent until the end of the decade.

Figure 3.13 indicates that there was a higher margin of safety for the National Bank until the
outbreak of the Balkan Wars. This is in tune with the observation that revenue increased at a
greater rate than expenses up to 1911, leading to higher profit margins. By contrast, during the
rest of the period, with the exception of the period from 1919 to 1922, expenses grew at a
greater rate than revenue leading to lower profit margins.
Figure 3.14 indicates the percentage of net profits of the National Bank distributed as
a dividend. The percentage share of net profits distributed fluctuated between 80 per cent and
95 per cent between 1898 and 1919. By contrast in 1920, a mere 30 per cent of net profits of
the bank of issue was distributed as a dividend. The following year this share dropped further
to 11 per cent. This change in the dividend policy of the National Bank in 1920 is explained
by changes related to its role as a bank of issue and the way that it was taxed.
Figure 3.14: Percentage of net profits of the National Bank paid as dividend, 1898–1930 Source: Table A2.24 in Appendix A2.
Figure 3.15 shows the annual dividend paid per share at 1911 prices each year during the
period in question. It indicates that dividend paid at 1911 prices increased until 1905 and then
fluctuated at around the same price until 1913. After the outbreak of the Great War the
dividend fell. In the 1920s, the annual dividend distributed per share was smaller than that
paid between 1910 and 1913. The governors of the Bank, however, emphasised to
shareholders that dividend had increased to unprecedented levels, referring of course to
nominal rises.

4.1. The National Bank as an issuing bank
Between the outbreak of the First World War and the stabilisation of the drachma the issuing
privilege of the National Bank was extended three times and the government resorted to the
printing press over and over again to finance war. As a consequence the money stock
increased by more than seventeen-fold between 1914 and 1928.179 Figure 4.1 illustrates this
increase very vividly.
During the entire period in question the money supply did not consist of one simple
issue, but of several issues added together with different legal bases. Tables 4.1 and 4.4
summarise the different categories of banknotes that were in circulation in 1914 and in 1928
when the National Bank finally lost its issuing privilege. In both tables, banknotes in
circulation were organised in categories according to the legal provisions related to their issue
and at the same time in the way that were reported on the balance sheet of the National Bank.
These different issues of banknotes also illustrate the complex relationship between the
National Bank and the government.
179 Money stock here is M0 which means that only banknotes in circulation are included. Throughout the thesis money stock is used interchangeably with banknotes in circulation and money supply.

All banknotes in circulation were exchanged according to their nominal value and the public
was not aware of the different laws that led to their printing. Nor did the banknotes
themselves indicate their origin. During discussions over the stabilisation of the drachma in
Geneva in June 1927, the Financial Committee of the League recommended the
amalgamation of all the different banknote issues into one that would be regulated by the
same legal arrangements.180
In this section of Chapter 4 the role of the National Bank as a bank of issue is
examined. Firstly, therefore, the monetary arrangements that prevailed on the eve of the
outbreak of the First World War will be examined so as to assist with understanding the
methods employed to increase the banknotes in circulation between 1914 and 1927. Secondly,
a question is posed regarding the kind of monetary rule that Greece introduced in 1910. This
year is usually cited by contemporary economic historians and economists as the year that
Greece adopted either the gold standard or the gold exchange standard, depending on their
view. By contrast, before the early 1980s it was generally believed that the Greek currency
had remained inconvertible throughout the period from September 1885, when the gold
standard was suspended, until May 1928 when the gold exchange standard was de jure
introduced. What was the monetary arrangement in Greece in 1910 that has prompted
scholars to argue more recently that Greece adopted a clearly defined monetary rule during
that year, even though there is no agreement amongst them on which rule Greece in fact
introduced? Thirdly, the methods employed for the increase in the banknotes in circulation
between the outbreak of the First World War and the stabilisation of the drachma will be
presented. In this way, the position of the National Bank as a bank of issue will be further
exposed. In addition, the origins of the monetary upheaval of the 1920s will be pinpointed.
4.1.1. Money supply in 1914
After the end of the Balkan Wars the land area of Greece and its population was doubled as a
result of the annexation of Epirus and Macedonia. In those newly annexed areas the Greek
currency was not the only currency that was used as a medium of exchange in 1914; the
Turkish lira and gold coins were also used in everyday transactions. Payments to the Greek
army still stationed in those areas, however, facilitated the substitution of the drachma in
place of the other currencies in circulation. It is believed that only in 1916 did the drachma
begin to be the dominant currency in those areas.181 Consequently, any attempt to estimate the
money supply in Greece in 1914 should take this fact into account.

As Table 4.1 below illustrates, the system of banknote issue in 1914 can be divided
into three categories: firstly, banknotes that were in circulation because of the note issue
privilege; secondly, banknotes issued for the account of the government and finally, those in
issue because of the ΓΧΜΒ Law of 1910.

This number does not include banknotes that were in circulation because of the issuing privilege of the Ionian Bank and the Bank of Crete.

4.1.1.1. Issuing privilege
As has been discussed before, in 1914 there were three banks in the country that enjoyed the
note issuing privilege: the National Bank, the Ionian Bank and the Bank of Crete. By this
130


time, however, one of them, the Ionian Bank had already agreed that it would transfer its
issuing privilege to the National Bank in 1920.182
The National Bank had the legal right to circulate banknotes to the value of 66
million drachmae: 60 million drachmae in its own right and a further 6 million drachmae
following the acquisition of a minor issuing bank, the Bank of Epirus-Thessaly in 1898.183
The Ionian Bank, established in 1839, had the issuing privilege for the Ionian Islands
and could circulate up to 7 million drachmae in banknotes. The third bank of issue in Greece,
the Bank of Crete, founded in 1899, was granted the issuing right for Crete which at the time
was an autonomous area. The Bank of Crete could issue up to approximately 10.5 million
drachmae in banknotes. The National Bank contributed to the share capital of the Bank of
Crete and owned 8 thousand shares out of a total of 40 thousand. Crete was annexed by
Greece in 1913 and in 1920 the Bank of Crete’s issuing privilege was transferred to the
National Bank. Hence, in 1920 with both minor banks of issue, the Ionian Bank and the Bank
of Crete, handing over their issuing rights, the National Bank then had a complete monopoly
of note issue until 1928 when the Bank of Greece was established.
4.1.1.2. Law of Control
Article 30 of the Law of Control of 1898 set a precise timetable for the retirement of
government debt in banknotes.184 The Law of Control stipulated that from 1900 onwards the
government had to cancel banknotes of at least 2 million drachmae every year until debt in
banknotes of forced circulation had been gradually reduced to 40 million drachmae. At the
time of the enactment of this law, government debt in forced currency was 74 million
drachmae and small notes of one and two drachmae guaranteed by the banks of issue
amounted to 20 million drachmae.185 In addition, the Law of Control specified that no new
forced currency loan could be made to the Greek government without the assent of the IFC
until its debt in banknotes of forced currency had been fully paid off.

This measure introduced by the Law of Control was characteristic of the deflationary
measures implemented in countries that experienced a debt crisis in the late nineteenth
century.186 The Law of Control provided for a slow but substantial withdrawal of forced
currency from circulation. The retirement of 2 million drachmae in 1900, when this measure
was implemented for the first time, was the equivalent of 1.43 per cent of the total banknotes
that could be circulated during that year. In total, however, the Law of Control required a
substantial cumulative retirement of approximately one-fourth of the total monetary base of
1900 ceteris paribus.
The Greek government abided by this provision of the Law of Control even in the
early 1920s when the printing press was liberally used, and finally the target stipulated was
achieved in 1925.187
4.1.1.3. ΓΧΜΒ Law
Article 30 of the Law of Control which was introduced in 1898, encouraged monetary
discipline in Greece; it strictly prohibited the National Bank from using the printing press to
support lending to the government without the consent of the IFC, until the debt in banknotes
from the forced circulation had been fully paid off. Article 30, however, incorporated an
escape clause which allowed for an increase in the number of banknotes in circulation on
condition that this was for the ‘needs of trade’.188
This article of the Law of Control defined the obligations of the Greek authorities
relating to monetary issues. It was the only article in the entire Law of Control, or ΒΦΙΘ Law
as it is otherwise known, that dealt with monetary matters. Article 30 also set out the
supervisory duties of the IFC regarding monetary policy in Greece.

188 United Kingdom, House of Commons, Greece No. 1: Greek Law of Control (1898, pp. 14–15). More precisely Article 30 of the Law of Control read as follows: ‘The debt in bank notes of forced currency, amounting to 74,000,000 drachmas as well as the debt in small notes of 1 or 2 drachmas, guaranteed by the banks of issue amounting to 20,000,000 drachmas, shall be withdrawn, from the year 1900 onwards, annual payments of which the minimum is fixed at 2,000,000 drachmas. This withdrawal may cease with the assent of the International Commission, when the debt in bank notes has been reduced to 40,000,000, drachmas. No new forced currency loan may be concluded by the Government without the assent of the International Commission, before the debt in bank notes of forced currency has been fully paid off. No other fiduciary issue may be ordered or authorised by the Government beyond such as may take place to meet the needs of trade within the limits fixed or to be fixed by the Statutes of the present and future banks of issue.’
132


It should be noted that the Law of Control did not stipulate that Greece had to
introduce the gold standard as is asserted in the literature dealing with the period in question.
However, it could be argued that adhering to the monetary policies defined by article 30
might have led to the adoption of the gold standard which was the prevailing monetary
standard at the time.
The escape clause incorporated in article 30 of the Law of Control was used in 1910
to introduce article eight of the ΓΧΜΒ Law which outlined the prerequisites for an increase in
the money supply without the Law of Control being violated.
On 19 March 1910 (Julian calendar), two laws were enacted by the Greek
government: the ΓΧΜΑ Law which dealt with coinage and the ΓΧΜΒ Law or the Law
hereafter, the primary purpose of which was to authorise the flotation of a loan on the
international financial markets.189 Articles one to seven of this law dealt specifically with the
flotation of a loan of up to 150 million gold drachmae, whilst article ten proposed the
restructuring of the government loans denominated in gold and placed under the jurisdiction
of the IFC.
The ΓΧΜΒ Law, however, is still remembered and discussed for its eighth article
which introduced the most important monetary reform in Greece between the suspension of
convertibility in 1885 and the adoption of the gold exchange standard in 1928. It provided an
innovative way to increase the money supply and at the same time to safeguard the external
value of the drachma.
Article eight of the ΓΧΜΒ Law is also often called the Valaorites Law as it was the
brainchild of Ioannis Valaorites, the sub-governor of the National Bank.190 Valaorites drafted
the article and the minister of finance agreed to add it to the ΓΧΜΒ Law. The IFC did not
raise any objections.
Article eight of the ΓΧΜΒ Law authorised the National Bank to increase for its own
account, the banknotes in circulation beyond the limit that its issuing privilege allowed on
condition that these freshly printed notes were used to buy gold and foreign exchange at a
189 See National Bank of Greece (1913, pp. 233–240). In fact, the ΓΧΜΒ Law was entitled ‘About a loan up to 240,000,000 gold drachmae, about ending forced circulation and about changing the terms validated by the ΒΦΙΘ Law of 26 February 1898 of the International Control, relating to gold loans under their jurisdiction’.
190 It has been argued that a similar scheme had been proposed by the director of the Bank of Athens, Ioannis Pesmazoglou in 1903. For example, see Kostis (2003, p. 83); Lazaretou (2007, pp. 181–193).

price that was not above par. The National Bank was then obliged to sell the gold at par plus 1
per thousand as a commission. Foreign exchange was to be sold at the equivalent of the parity
of the drachma with the French franc, this time with half a per cent added as profit.191 When
gold or foreign exchange was sold then the equivalent value in banknotes had to be
withdrawn from circulation. The Law also provided that an agreement between the National
Bank and the government, validated by a royal decree, was necessary to determine the limit
up to which banknotes could be issued by the National Bank whilst still abiding by the
principles of this Law. Subsequent agreements could authorise a further increase in the upper
limit of the banknotes issued under the principles stated in article eight. In addition, this
article allowed the use of gold coins as a medium of exchange.
The parity that the ΓΧΜΒ Law refers to was the parity of the drachma set in 1868
when Greece joined the Latin Monetary Union (LMU), that is to say that one paper drachma
equalled one gold drachma, which in turn was equal to one French franc. This parity had been
reached towards the end of 1909 after a long period where the Greek currency had at first
depreciated severely between 1886 and 1902 and then appreciated again.
It should be noted that the ΓΧΜΒ Law did not restrict the buying and selling of
foreign exchange to the foreign exchange of countries on the gold standard, as has been
argued.192 The Law refers only to foreign exchange in general a practice followed in all the
subsequent agreements between the government and the National Bank authorising the latter
to increase the banknotes in circulation under the principles of article eight of the ΓΧΜΒ
Law.
Article nine of the ΓΧΜΒ Law allowed for an increase in the nominal capital of any
loan to be authorised under this law from 150 million gold drachmae to 240 million gold
drachmae on the same terms. The proceeds of this additional part of the loan would be
assigned exclusively to the repayment of the debt on forced banknotes to the bank of issue.
This article of the ΓΧΜΒ Law also stated that the date of the suspension of inconvertibility
would be determined by a royal decree after the National Bank had been consulted. Needless
to say, this part of the loan was never issued and inconvertibility remained by law. Ultimately,
the nominal capital of the loan that was floated, the Bonds Loan of 1910 as it is known, did
not exceed 110 million gold drachmae.193

134


The literature argues that the ΓΧΜΒ Law was introduced to boost the economy.194 It
is possible, however, that the main reason for its introduction was to curb the appreciation of
the drachma at a time that it was fluctuating close to the Latin Monetary Union parity and
with the Greek government about to float a loan on the international financial markets. Under
the ΓΧΜΒ Law, the National Bank acquired the means to intervene in the foreign exchange
market to maintain a stable drachma and prevent any seasonal fluctuations of the external
value of the Greek currency. In addition, its objective was to increase liquidity, in particular
during the period of the harvest. Last but not least, article eight of the ΓΧΜΒ Law was aimed
at paving the way for the introduction of the gold standard at some time in the future when
conditions were favourable. This Law proved to be an inexpensive way for the National Bank
to increase its reserves both in gold and foreign exchange. As it is demonstrated in Chapter 3,
these foreign exchange reserves became a significant source of profit for the Bank.
By the end of 1912, Greece was embroiled in the First Balkan War and policy makers
had become complacent over the monetary arrangement in Greece. There was no talk of
introducing de jure convertibility which would most probably have entailed a settlement of
the government debt in forced circulation to the bank of issue.195 For its part the National
Bank, a private institution, enjoyed the benefits of the ΓΧΜΒ Law without the ‘golden
fetters’.
The Valaorites Law operated as it was designed to do until 1915, though gold parity
of the drachma was maintained until 1919. In 1915 for the first time, the National Bank used
Book Credits to issue banknotes under the ΓΧΜΒ Law, a practice that was repeated again and
again during the Great War and which became one of the main reasons for the monetary
upheaval of the 1920s. This use of the ΓΧΜΒ Law will be discussed extensively in other parts
of the thesis as it developed into a controversial issue.
Article eight of the ΓΧΜΒ Law set out the prerequisites for an increase in the money
supply. Subsequently, an agreement between the National Bank and the government validated
by a royal decree determined the limit of banknotes which could be issued by the National
Bank whilst still abiding by the principles of this Law. In September 1910 for the first time,
the National Bank was authorised to issue up to 10 million drachmae. As Table 4.2 below
194 For the reasons that led to the introduction of the ΓΧΜΒ Law see: Annual Report of the National Bank for 1910 (1911); Zolotas (1928, pp. 7–8 and 77–81); Psalidopoulos (1989, pp. 53–54); Alogoskoufis and Lazaretou (1997, pp. 83–85); Kokkinakis (1999, pp. 497–557); Kostis (2003, pp. 7890).
195 Valaorites even hinted in one of his reports when he served as the governor of the National Bank that convertibility could be endorsed by law without the government having repaid its debt in forced circulation to the bank of issue. See the Annual Report of the National Bank for 1910 (1911, p. ιβ ́).

shows, two more agreements between the National Bank and the government followed in a
short span of time. Figure 4.2 illustrates that by the end of 1910, 17 per cent of the total
banknotes in circulation were banknotes in circulation because of the ΓΧΜΒ Law and by the
end of 1914 this amount had risen to 61 per cent.

4.1.2. Did Greece genuinely introduce either of the Gold, or Gold Exchange,
Standards in 1910?
4.1.2.1. Approaches to the 1910 monetary arrangement in historical perspective
The year 1910 is usually cited by contemporary economists and economic historians as the
year that Greece adopted either the gold standard or the gold exchange standard. In some
literature it is stated that Greece successfully adopted the gold standard in 1910. On the other
hand, there is literature in which it is argued that Greece in fact introduced the gold exchange
standard that year. Furthermore, in a recent thesis it is maintained that Greece was a gold
standard country in the ‘conventional sense’ from 1885 until 1909 or even 1910 when the
country is said to have ‘switched’ to the gold exchange standard.196 Previously, or at least
until the 1980s it was generally believed that Greece had been on forced circulation and that
its currency had remained inconvertible throughout the period from September 1885 when the
gold standard was suspended until May 1928 when the gold exchange standard was de jure
introduced. In this section of the thesis, an attempt is made to examine claims made in recent
economic history literature about the type of monetary system that Greece utilised before the
outbreak of the Great War and at the same time to present the dominant view amongst
scholars, policy makers and consequently investors in Greek government bonds at the time.

1 ‘Until today’ is the exact phrasing in the document and refers to the date that this table was compiled, possibly 31 December 1926.
2 Greece was following the Julian calendar until February 1923. Source: HABOG_A3S1Y2F138T8, p.1.
Table 4.3 above illustrates the periods that the drachma was convertible into gold, as well as
the periods of inconvertibility from the establishment of the National Bank in 1842 until the
point when it conceded its issuing privilege to the Bank of Greece in the late 1920s. This table
was compiled by officials at the National Bank possibly in December 1926, at a time when
they were working on the stabilisation of the drachma after a long period of monetary
instability.197 At about this time, Zolotas (1928, pp. 6–8) also wrote that there were four
periods during which the drachma was inconvertible between 1848 and 1928. A discrepancy
may be noticed between Table 4.3 and the information Zolotas provided regarding the day or
the month that inconvertibility was enacted or suspended. If the information, however,
provided in Table 4.3 above and that provided by Zolotas is compared, it is obvious that the
periods that the drachma was inconvertible and therefore also those when it was convertible
coincide. In general therefore, there is a consensus in the archival material as well as in the
literature published before the early 1980s, about the monetary system in Greece before the
outbreak of the First World War. The gold standard was adopted on 1 January 1885 (Julian
calendar) and convertibility was sustained until 19 September 1885 (Julian calendar).
Subsequently, the drachma was inconvertible until 12 May 1928 when the gold exchange
standard was adopted by law.
There is, however, a noticeable difference if Table 4.3, prepared by policy makers at
the time, is compared with tables produced by contemporary economic historians: these days

it is widely argued that Greece introduced ether the gold standard or the gold exchange
standard in 1910. It is also claimed that Greece remained on a monetary standard either until
1914 or until 1919. A notable exception remains Coskun Tuncer (2011) who argues that the
monetary standard in Greece between 1885 and 1910 was ‘conventionally’ characterised as
the gold standard, and this in spite of the fact that the drachma remained irredeemable. In this
way, Tuncer endorses the idea that Greece was on the gold standard from 1885 until 1910.198
This idea, however, is unsubstantiated; no evidence is provided to support the claim that
Greece was ‘conventionally’ regarded as a gold standard country throughout the period from
1885 until 1909. In fact, an attempt was made and convertibility was introduced on 1 January
(Julian calendar) 1885 and for nearly nine months until 19 September (Julian calendar) 1885
the country did operate the gold standard. Subsequently, the drachma firstly depreciated
severely and then appreciated until the end of 1909 when the LMU parity was reached; that is
to say one paper drachma was equal to one gold drachma which in turn was equal to one
French franc. Furthermore, it should be stressed that contrary to Tuncer’s claims, there is a
consensus in the literature that Greece was not a gold standard country between September
1885 and 1910. It may be thought in fact that Tuncer’s approach lacks rigour, since on the one
hand he argues that Greece was regarded as a gold standard country between 1885 and 1909
but on the other that the drachma was inconvertible and indeed fluctuated severely, and this
against a background of Greece having defaulted in December 1893.199
4.1.2.2. What the ΓΧΒΜ Law provided and its evolution
On 19 March 1910 (Julian calendar), two laws were enacted by the Greek government: the
ΓΧΜΑ Law which dealt with the question of coins and the ΓΧΜΒ Law which primarily
198 For example see Tuncer (2011, Table 2.7 on p. 136 and Table 2.10 on p. 155).
199 Inconsistency in this thesis does not end with the claim that Greece was ‘conventionally characterised as a gold standard country’. For example on page 271, Tuncer (2011) makes an attempt to explain the first ‘break’ in the time series that is detected by the statistical analysis. He writes that the ‘first break in 1884 is probably due to the suspension of gold convertibility by the National Bank of Greece. As discussed in Chapters 2 and 3 in the case of Greece, foreign creditors were especially apprehensive about the excessive amount of ‘forced banknotes’ in circulation. Greece’s lack of commitment to the LMU agreement and the adherence to the gold standard which lasted only six months, was reflected in a decrease in its credibility in the financial markets’. (See also Table 4.2, p. 268). However, in December 1884 when a break is detected, the drachma was inconvertible thus no ‘suspension of gold convertibility’ could take place. In fact it had been inconvertible since 1877 as it is demonstrated in table 4.3 above. It should be repeated again that Greece joined the gold standard countries on 1 January (Julian calendar) 1885 and remained on gold for nearly nine months until 19 September (Julian calendar) of that same year, not for roughly six months as is claimed by Tuncer. Other areas of Tuncer’s thesis may not in the end survive scrutiny. For example in Table 3.10 (p. 243) it is stated that Greece floated eight loans between 1898 and 1914. In fact, between the introduction of the Law of Control and the outbreak of the First World War five loans were issued if the 2.50 per cent Guaranteed Loan of 1898 is included, namely, the 1898 Guaranteed Loan, the 1902 Railways Loan, the 1907 Loan, the 1910 Bonds Loan and the 1914 Loan.
139


authorised the government to issue a loan on the international financial markets.200 Article
eight of the latter law, as has been explained above, gave the right to the National Bank to
issue banknotes under the condition that these banknotes were used by the Bank to buy gold
and foreign exchange at a price that was not above par. The National Bank could
subsequently sell this gold at par plus initially 1 per thousand as a commission and the foreign
exchange at the equivalent of the parity of the drachma with the French franc this time with
half a per cent added as profit. It should be stressed again that the ΓΧΜΒ Law stated that
foreign exchange in general could be bought and sold and did not restrict the buying or selling
of foreign exchange to that of countries that were on the gold standard at the time. Stating that
the Valaorites Law restricted the buying and selling of foreign exchange to foreign exchange
based on gold then both the letter and the spirit of this law are lost. The only constraint that
the ΓΧΜΒ Law imposed was that the National Bank could only use the banknotes issued
under the terms of this law to purchase gold and foreign exchange at a price that was not
above par. In addition, the gold and foreign exchange obtained under the terms of this Law
could only be sold at par plus a small profit.201 Therefore, the banknotes in circulation under
the principles of the 1910 Law had to be fully collateralised with gold and foreign exchange.
The inclusion of article eight to the ΓΧΜΒ Law, which was the most important
monetary development in Greece since the suspension of gold convertibility in September
1885, has probably led contemporary economic historians and economists to claim that
Greece adopted either the gold standard or the gold exchange standard in March 1910.
Contrary to claims in recent literature, however, Greece neither adopted the gold
standard in March 1910, nor was one of the European countries that were on the gold standard
on the eve of the outbreak of the First World War. Nor can it be said that the gold exchange
standard was adopted in March 1910. If it is argued that Greece adopted the gold standard or
even the gold exchange standard in March 1910 then aspects of the political economy at the
time surrounding monetary issues are overlooked. In addition, both the spirit and letter of the
Valaorites Law are completely ignored. At the time, the National Bank was in favour of a
stable drachma at its LMU parity but was not yet ready for the introduction of the gold
standard. The authorities at the National Bank were cautious not to repeat the 1885 experience
when Greece remained on the gold standard for merely nine months, causing the National
Bank to lose a considerable part of its reserves in trying to defend the parity of the drachma.
As an alternative, the ΓΧΜΒ Law provided the bank of issue with a degree of flexibility and
freedom that the gold standard did not permit, whilst at the same time paving the way for its
200 National Bank of Greece (1913, pp. 233–240).
201 See ibid., p. 238.

adoption when conditions allowed. Furthermore, the Law provided the National Bank with an
inexpensive way to increase its gold and foreign exchange reserves.
The ΓΧΜΒ Law proposed that the National Bank be able to print a quantity of
banknotes limited by decree, and subsequently to use those banknotes to buy gold and foreign
currency at a rate that was not above par. In fact, this term of the Law was against one of the
main tenets of both the gold standard and the gold exchange standard, whereby the bank of
issue firstly had to accumulate gold or gold related reserves and then on the strength of these
reserves to print banknotes. In addition, the central bank of a country on the gold standard or
the gold exchange standard was required to exchange unlimited quantities of banknotes in
circulation with gold or gold based foreign exchange.
The Valaorites Law obliged the National Bank to convert into gold and foreign
exchange at par only the banknotes in circulation on account of this law. The remaining of the
money supply, which included the banknotes in circulation under the privilege of the issuing
banks as well as those of forced circulation, were not by law convertible at par into gold and
foreign exchange. However, the share of the banknotes in circulation because of the ΓΧΜΒ
Law gradually increased as Figures 4.2 and 4.3 demonstrate. In fact, after October 1912 the
banknotes in circulation issued under the ΓΧΜΒ Law became the dominant component of the
money supply. For example, by the end of December 1912 half of the banknotes in circulation
were banknotes under the ΓΧΜΒ Law.
With the ΓΧΜΒ Law the drachma was pegged at its LMU parity to the French franc.
At the same time, the National Bank acquired the tools to intervene in the foreign exchange
market by buying or selling gold and/or foreign exchange, and in this way to maintain the
external value of the drachma around its LMU parity. This commitment mechanism
resembled the gold exchange standard and thus it could, if questionably, be argued that article
eight of the ΓΧΜΒ Law helped Greece gradually to ‘shadow’ the gold exchange standard.
This claim, however, should not conceal the distinctive characteristics of the Valaorites Law,
the advantages of which were praised so long as the drachma remained at par, whilst its
shortcomings were comprehended only in retrospect after the drachma started depreciating in
1919.

In March 1910 there were in circulation banknotes from the two issuing banks, the National
Bank and the Ionian Bank, and banknotes of forced circulation which were governed by the
Law of Control of 1898. (See Figure 4.3 above and Table A3.1 in Appendix A3.) The
Valaorites Law gave the right to the National Bank to issue banknotes up to a certain amount
specified by a royal decree under the condition that these freshly printed banknotes would be
used to buy gold and/or foreign exchange.
As it has been noted before, in September 1910 for the first time, the National Bank
was authorised to issue up to 10 million drachmae in banknotes. By the end of September

1910, nearly 6 per cent of the total banknotes in circulation were banknotes that had been
issued in response to the Valaorites Law, whilst by the end of December of that same year this
amount had risen to 17 per cent. (See Figure 4.2.) The National Bank resorted to this right
repeatedly prior to the outbreak of the First World War as Table 4.2 demonstrates. As a result,
the percentage share of the banknotes issued following the passage of the ΓΧΜΒ Law
increased considerably. This was even more the case since the National Bank kept banknotes
issued out of its own privilege as cash reserves. In addition, the withdrawal of banknotes
according to the Law of Control was temporarily suspended until December 1914 as the
ΓΧΜΑ Law provided. (See Figure 4.3 as well as Table A3.1 in Appendix A3.) For example,
by the end of 1912, half of the banknotes in circulation were banknotes that had been issued
under the ΓΧΜΒ Law. In January 1914, nearly 74 per cent of the value of the banknotes in
circulation owned their origin to the Valaorites Law. This was the highest percentage share of
banknotes in circulation under the principles of the 1910 Law in the total of the money supply
before the outbreak of the Great War.
Consequently, it may be seen that article eight of the ΓΧΜΒ Law laid the foundations
for Greece gradually to ‘shadow’ the gold exchange standard as it provided the bank of issue
with an inexpensive way to accumulate easily sufficient reserves of gold and foreign
exchange. In this way, the National Bank was able to sustain the drachma at par until 1919.
The operation of the Valaorites Law led to a degree of freedom in the monetary
system and this allowed for an increase in the money supply under certain conditions. As can
be seen in Figure 4.4 below, the money supply in Greece increased after the introduction of
the 1910 Law. In particular, the money supply started increasing rapidly after July 1912 and
by the end of 1914 it had more than doubled, as Figures 4.3 and 4.4 indicate. In addition, it
provided the bank of issue with an inexpensive way to accumulate easily sufficient reserves of
gold and foreign exchange and in this way to be able to sustain the drachma at par until 1919.

4.1.2.3. Some thoughts on the 1910 monetary arrangement
‘From 1885 until [the late 1920s] the Greek monetary system had been on forced circulation
of the paper drachma. From 1910 until 1919 the Greek paper drachma was at par with the
gold drachma (equal to 0.29034 grams of pure gold), whilst on the other hand forced
circulation continued to operate under law. The operation of the ΓΧΜΒ Law contributed
towards real parity.’202 Thus begins a document entitled ‘A treatise on the stabilisation of the
drachma’, written possibly in late 1926 and kept in the archive of Emmanuel Tsouderos, the
deputy governor of the National Bank at the time and one of the principal architects of de jure
stabilisation in the late 1920s. The document goes on to say that since 1885 the Greek
economy had been legally on forced circulation, a measure not lifted even during the period
from 1910 until 1919 when the drachma remained at par.203 At the time ‘forced circulation’
was often used as a term meaning inconvertibility, as forced circulation was considered to be
incompatible with the gold standard. This in a nutshell, is how the monetary conditions that
prevailed in Greece between 1910 and 1919 are described in archival material on the period in
question as well as in literature published before the 1980s.204

Before the 1980s the stability of the exchange rate of the drachma between 1910 and
1914 was admired. In addition, the fact that the drachma remained at par during the Great
War was praised. The ΓΧΜΒ Law was credited with the stability of the Greek currency
between 1910 and 1919. In fact, the chairman of the Ionian Bank, Falconer Larkworthy, an
ardent advocate of the ΓΧΜΒ Law, repeatedly urged during the war ‘the adoption in Great
Britain of the Valaorites currency reform scheme of 1910’.205 In 1917, at the annual general
meeting of the Ionian Bank in London, Larkworthy noted the stability of the external value of
the drachma despite the turmoil of war, the high level of reserves maintained in proportion to
the banknotes in circulation in Greece and finally the significant return that the National Bank
enjoyed from the foreign exchange reserves held as cover for the banknotes issued under the
Valaorites Law and which were deposited at banks abroad. These outcomes he believed,
made the ‘Greek system’ ‘extraordinarily suggestive’ to other countries.206
Valaorites, the father of the ΓΧΜΒ Law, as the governor of the National Bank
acknowledged in the annual reports for 1910 and 1912 that the country was on forced
circulation under law.207 Valaorites, however, repeatedly made clear in the same annual
reports that since the gold parity of the drachma had been achieved, then in practice forced
currency circulation did not exist.208 He added that the introduction of article eight of the
ΓΧΜΒ Law protected the parity of the drachma because it encouraged the accumulation of
considerable reserves in gold and foreign exchange. He also commented that because of the
ΓΧΜΒ Law the suspension of forced circulation, that is to say the repayment of the
government debt to the bank of issue in banknotes in circulation which might have meant
considerable cost for the government, was no longer imperative. It is important, however, to
note that Valaorites also recognised that with the ΓΧΜΒ Law in place the country only
partially enjoyed the benefits of a system devoid of forced circulation. The monetary authority
could not after all expand the number of banknotes in circulation to support the real
economy.209
Zolotas in the late 1920s, the heyday of the gold exchange standard, also made a
distinction between forced circulation by law and in practice. Although he regarded the period
from 1885 to 1928 as a period of inconvertibility, he argued that a new system had prevailed

in Greece between 1910 and 1919, that of the gold exchange standard.210 He resorted to a
David Ricardo treatise to support his view.211 When, however, he examined the exchange rate
policy between 1910 and 1927, he maintained that the ΓΧΜΒ Law had introduced in Greece
a variation on the gold exchange standard.212 A further reference in the 1920s relating the
ΓΧΜΒ Law with the gold exchange standard was made in the report prepared by the
representatives of the League who visited Athens in the spring of 1927.213
Preliminary research into the financial press for 1910 showed that no attention was
paid to article eight of the ΓΧΜΒ Law, the clause that would become known as the Valaorites
Law. This preliminary research shows that press interest was focused on the flotation of the
new loan.214 The possibility of a restructuring of the public debt that was under the
supervision of the IFC was also an issue that was broadly discussed in the press. More
research, however, should be carried out into the foreign press, as well as into the reports of
the IFC for the period in question in order to establish how market participants in general and
foreign supervisors saw monetary developments in Greece between 1910 and 1914.
Writing in the early 1920s, Andreades showed great perception when he observed
that the fact that the parity of the drachma had been sustained between 1910 and 1919 could
lead to the conclusion that inconvertibility had been suspended during that period. He further
added that the enactment of the ΓΧΜΑ Law also in 1910, which dealt with coinage, could
reinforce this view.215 These observations from the 1920s pre-empted claims in recent
economic history literature that focus on monetary changes in Greece in 1910. Nowadays, it is
argued that Greece adopted either the gold standard or the gold exchange standard in 1910. At
the time, the inclusion of article eight to the ΓΧΜΒ Law, a law that primarily aimed at
authorising the government to float a loan on the international financial markets, aimed at
solving two problems: firstly, the shortage of banknotes that was experienced in the country
in particular during the second semester of the year, in other words during the period of the
harvest, and secondly to sustain the drachma at par during a period that the drachma had
reached its LMU parity and at the same time it was widely expected that the Greek currency
would appreciate further because of the flotation of the new loan.

In February 1911, approximately a year after the enactment of the ΓΧΜΒ Law, the
new governor of the National Bank, Valaorites, stated that the monetary changes introduced
by this law had achieved their aims.216 In other words, the ΓΧΜΒ Law had helped to sustain
the drachma at par and at the same time provided liquidity to the economy and a degree of
flexibility to the system. In short, before the 1980s the monetary development in Greece in
March 1910 was identified with the ΓΧΜΒ Law. Furthermore, article eight of the ΓΧΜΒ
Law was regarded as a preliminary step that would pave the way for de jure introduction of
convertibility and therefore adoption of the gold standard at some point in the future. It should
be stressed that this monetary development was not a conscious act on the part of Greek
monetary policy authorities to adopt for the country an exchange standard, let alone the gold
exchange standard. In addition, although the IFC was based in Athens, the monetary change
in 1910 was entirely a Greek initiative which was simply approved by the IFC. In other words
the IFC did not oppose the inclusion of article eight into the ΓΧΜΒ Law , which was entirely
an arrangement between the sub-governor of the bank of issue and the minister of finance.
The sub-governor of the National Bank drafted it and the minister of finance agreed to add it
to the ΓΧΜΒ Law whi ch aimed at authorising the flotation of an international loan. It is,
however, beyond the scope of this thesis to examine in detail the origins of article eight of the
ΓΧΜΒ Law, or the schemes proposed before 1910 and the debate that took place in Athens
between 1898 and 1910 regarding monetary issues.
Tuncer in his thesis argues that the role of the IFC in Greece was instrumental in the
successful transition to the gold exchange standard in 1910.217 Tuncer, however, provides no
fresh evidence to challenge claims in the literature that the introduction of article eight to the
ΓΧΜΒ Law was an initiative of the sub-governor of the National Bank which was endorsed
by the minister of finance. The role of the IFC in the monetary advance in Greece in 1910 was
simply to give their consent. It should be also repeated that in 1910 there was no deliberate
intention on the part of either the government or the bank of issue to introduce the gold
exchange standard as Tuncer claims. The addition of article eight to the ΓΧΜΒ Law was a
measure that was aimed on the one hand at helping the National Bank to increase the
banknotes in circulation and on the other to keep the external value of the drachma stable until
conditions would allow the adoption of the gold standard.
Tuncer’s examination of the contribution of the IFC to monetary developments in
Greece between 1898 and 1910, and at the same time their fiscal responsibility and duties, is
partial and lacks balance. In 1898 the Greek government conceded a substantial part of its
216 Annual Report of the National Bank for 1910 (1911, p. ιβ ́). 217 For example, see Tuncer (2011, pp. 153, 271, 307 and 308).

total revenues to the IFC and the primary task of the IFC was to improve the interest rate paid
on Greek loans issued on the international markets before 1893 and placed under its
jurisdiction. The Law of Control defined the minimum interest rate to be paid to the
bondholders of the loans that the IFC supervised. The IFC, however, aimed at increasing the
coupon paid for the loans under its control to their full contractual level as well as the sinking
fund, using the public revenues that the government had assigned to them. Consequently, the
coupon rate paid to the bondholders of the Old Loans, as the loans issued before 1893 are
known, fluctuated within a band. It fluctuated between the rate set by the Law of Control and
the contractual level, depending on the surplus of the public revenues assigned to the IFC.218
The IFC was in effect a debt management committee whose role had been extended to
supervise monetary and fiscal policy as well. Tuncer emphasises monetary developments in
Greece between 1898 and 1914 which were not necessarily a consequence of the activities of
the IFC to claim that in the case of Greece there was ‘a complete loss of monetary
sovereignty’. At the same time, however, he ignores its fiscal responsibilities in order to
conclude that ‘the issue of fiscal sovereignty in the context of the Greek Commission should
be revisited’.219 This completely neglects the role of the National Bank in establishing
monetary policy as well as the political economy at the time, which was in favour of a stable
drachma close to its par.
Other claims in Tuncer’s thesis relating to the 1910 monetary advance also invite
further scrutiny. For example, when speaking of ‘the switch to the gold exchange standard’ in
Greece in 1910, it is repeatedly stated that ‘the banknotes in circulation came down to a
desirable level’.220 It is also stated that the ‘withdrawal of over-issued paper currency’ ended
in 1910 with the introduction of the gold exchange standard.221 Tuncer does not, however,
elaborate on what he means by ‘desirable level’ of banknotes in circulation. Two comments
should be made here. Firstly, it should be reminded that under the Law of Control the
government was required to cancel banknotes to a value of at least 2 million drachmae every
year until the debt in banknotes from forced circulation was reduced to 40 million drachmae.
This target was achieved in 1925, as Table A3.1 in Appendix A3 shows. Secondly, between
1898 and 1909, no significant reduction in the money supply took place as Figures 2.24, p.
150, 2.25, p. 152 and 3.5, p. 210 in Tuncer’s thesis show. Then, after September 1910 the
money supply increased as fresh banknotes were issued again and again under the principles
stated in article eight of the ΓΧΜΒ Law, as Figures 4.3 and 4.4 above demonstrate.
218 See Figure 6.4 in Chapter 6 and A4.1 in Appendix A4 of this thesis; See also Christodoulaki and Penzer (2004, pp. 15 and 60).

The importance of the share of forced circulation in the total banknotes in circulation
diminished after the ΓΧΜΒ Law was implemented. In January 1910, nearly 51 per cent of the
banknotes in circulation were forced banknotes. By January 1914, banknotes from forced
circulation had dropped to only 27 per cent of the total. (See Figure 4.3 above.) Furthermore,
government debt in forced banknotes as a percentage of the total assets of the National Bank
dropped from 16.35 per cent in 1910 to only 8.40 per cent in 1914. Whilst significant,
however, the decrease was due not so much to a decrease of the government debt in forced
circulation to the bank of issue as to an impressive increase in the total assets of the National
Bank. Debt in terms of forced circulation remained a significant obligation of the government
to the bank of issue throughout the period 1910 to 1914. Furthermore, the appreciation of the
drachma had increased its real value.
At the end of 1912, Greece was embroiled in the First Balkan War and by then, policy
makers had been complacent with the monetary arrangement in Greece. There was no talk of
de jure stabilisation of the drachma which would most probably have entailed the repayment
of forced circulation to the bank of issue.222 In spite of the fact that the external value of the
drachma had remained stable since the end of 1909, policy makers were still cautious not to
repeat the 1885 experience when Greece remained on the gold standard for merely nine
months, causing the National Bank to lose a considerable part of its reserves. For its part, the
bank of issue enjoyed the benefits of the ΓΧΜΒ Law without having the ‘golden fetters’.
Moreover, the reserves, mainly foreign exchange reserves that the National Bank accumulated
because of the ΓΧΜΒ Law, proved to be an important source of profit. It should be noted at
this point that in the 1920s the governor of the National Bank, Alexandros Diomides,
proposed to the Bank of England that Greece could enact another law, similar to the ΓΧΜΒ
Law, to stabilise the drachma at the time, rather than adopting the gold exchange standard.
Needless to say that Montagu Norman, the governor of the Bank of England, did not approve
this proposal. Instead, he suggested that the gold exchange standard should be introduced de
jure.
4.1.2.4. Concluding remarks
The discrepancy between the way that monetary change, in other words the ratification of
both the ΓΧΜΑ and ΓΧΜΒ Laws in Greece in March 1910, is seen in recent economic
history literature and by policy makers and scholars at the time raises the important question
222 Valaorites even hinted in one of his reports as the governor of the National Bank that they could endorse convertibility by law without the government having repaid its debt in forced circulation to the bank of issue. See Annual Report of the National Bank for 1910 (1911, p. ιβ ́).

‘what is [economic] history’.223 What is it that matters in economic history: the interpretative
choices of contemporary economic historians or the standards and perceptions that dominated
at the time? Such questions have an important bearing on research that examines the
creditworthiness of the Greek government during the period in question.
Before the 1980s, the monetary developments in Greece in 1910 were not thought to
be linked either to the gold standard or to the gold exchange standard. On the other hand,
before the Great War the gold exchange standard had been embraced both in some continental
countries and outside Europe. It was by no means invented at Genoa in 1922.224
At the time, certain characteristics defined the gold standard and the gold exchange
standard and were prerequisites for a country to adopt either of these monetary systems. The
idiosyncratic nature of examples like the monetary arrangement in Greece in 1910 will be lost
to history if research does not take them into account. Acknowledging such discrepancies and
examining them will increase our understanding of how the international financial system
functioned at the time and how certain countries, in this case Greece, were incorporated into
that system.
4.1.3. Between the outbreak of the war and stabilisation
As Table 4.4 below demonstrates, banknotes in circulation on the eve of the central banking
reform fell into four categories. Three of the four categories existed before the war: those
issued as a privilege of the National Bank, those issued because of the ΓΧΜΒ Law and those
for the account of the government. A new category of banknotes was added in 1923 when the
National Bank was given the right to issue banknotes to buy foreign exchange on behalf of the
government. Finally, in 1926 the Bank was authorised by law to issue banknotes to refund
those National Defence Bonds (NDBs) that still remained in circulation when they fell due.
The National Bank, however, never availed itself of this privilege.
Table 4.4 below summarises the different categories of banknotes that were in
circulation on the eve of the banking reforms. At the same time, it shows the way that the
money supply evolved after the outbreak of the First World War. The issuing privilege of the
National Bank was extended three times and the printing press was repeatedly used to create
banknotes for the account of the government whilst the ΓΧΜΒ Law was used as a vehicle by
which to finance the participation of Greece in the Great War.

4.1.3.1. Issuing Privilege
In 1914 the National Bank was negotiating the extension of its issuing privilege to the areas
annexed after the end of the Balkan Wars with the exception of Crete where the Bank of Crete
enjoyed the note privilege.225 Talks between the two sides were tough and concluded in an
agreement that became law in February 1915.226 Under this law the issuing privilege of the
National Bank was increased by 80 million drachmae. For the first time in its history as an
issuing bank the National Bank was legally obliged to maintain a cover: one-eighth of this
increase was backed with gold and a further one-eighth with Greek government bonds
denominated in gold.227 In other words, the National Bank had to hold one-quarter of this
authorised extension of its issuing privilege in gold and government bonds denominated in
gold in equal parts. It was said that this reserve arrangement had been recommended by the
IFC.228
In 1920, the issuing privilege of the Bank was extended by 300 million drachmae, this
being justified by the expansion of Greek territory as a consequence of the First World War.
Two-thirds of this extension, however, was passed on to the government as a loan. Following
the precedent set in 1915, the issuing bank had to retain a legal cover for this part of its
issuing right. One-eighth of the banknotes issued because of the extension of the note
privilege of the National Bank in 1920 was covered by gold and a further one-eighth by Greek
government bonds denominated in gold.229
In 1923, the issuing privilege of the National Bank was extended again by 300
million drachmae for the last time in its history as a note issuing bank.230 This extension of the
issuing privilege was aimed at the ‘strengthening of industry and shipping’. However, unlike
the two previous extensions of the note issuing privilege, this time the National Bank was not
obliged to retain any reserves for this extension of its issuing privilege.

4.1.3.2. ΓΧΜΒ Law between 1915 and 1919
Table 4.5 shows the number of banknotes that the National Bank was authorised to print as a
result of the ΓΧΜΒ Law between 1915 and 1919 when this law was used for the last time.
During this period, however, the principle of the law was violated as these banknotes were not
covered by gold and/or foreign exchange but by Book Credits, which carried no certainty of
being paid off. In fact, the ΓΧΜΒ Law became the main instrument by which to finance the
active participation of Greece in the First World War, and in the end it was one of the main
sources of the high inflation that the country experienced in the 1920s. These Book Credits
are examined in detail in Chapter 5.

Table 4.5 states the dates when a royal decree authorised an increase in the banknotes in
circulation under the ΓΧΜΒ Law between 1915 and 1919. It also shows the number of
banknotes that could be issued according to the agreement between the government and the
National Bank. In addition, it indicates the number of banknotes that were in circulation
because of the ΓΧΜΒ Law at the end of the month when a new agreement was signed as well
as the banknotes in circulation because of the ΓΧΜΒ Law as a percentage of the money
supply. By the end of January 1916, approximately 52 per cent of the total banknotes in
circulation were because of the 1910 Law whilst by the end of January 1919 this amount had
risen to nearly 92 per cent. It should be noted that the banknotes printed because of the
ΓΧΜΒ Law after 1915 were inflationary as they were collateralised with Book Credits,
although contemporaneous policy makers and National Bank authorities fervently argued the
opposite at the time.231
4.1.3.3. Banknotes issued for the account of the government
As the financial markets abroad were closed, the Greek government resorted to the National
Bank to finance public expenditure five times during the Asia Minor campaign. The printing
press was used once in 1920, once in 1921, twice during 1922 and then once more in early
1923.232 Table 4.4 above lists all the issues of banknotes for the account of the government
and states the amount that the National Bank was authorised by law to issue each time. It also
shows the remaining banknotes in circulation on the eve of the banking reforms.
These issues of banknotes were government loans. In all cases, the government was
charged commission of 0.50 per cent but no interest was levied and the amortisation period
was not specified. All the laws, however, that authorised the use of the printing press for the
account of the government, stated that convertibility could be restored only if the government
had repaid these loans to the bank of issue. At the time when discussions over the stabilisation
of the drachma were taking place, the government had paid back to the National Bank only
231 See, for example, Diomides (1922).
232 See NBGHA_Α1Σ18Υ1Φ165Ε1.
154


212 million drachmae. One-third of the proceeds of the 1928 Stabilisation Loan was used
therefore for the repayment of part of the remaining 2,588 million drachmae government debt
to the new bank of issue.233 The aim was to strengthen the reserve position of the Bank of
Greece for de jure stabilisation of the drachma.
4.1.3.4. April 1923 Law
In April 1923 a decree was passed that echoed the principles of the ΓΧΜΒ Law. This decree
gave the National Bank the right to issue banknotes in order to buy foreign exchange to
accommodate the needs of the government.234 The prerequisite set was that when the Bank
sold foreign exchange bought for the account of the government then it had to withdraw from
circulation banknotes of an equivalent value. The average price of the entirety of the foreign
exchange reserves bought for the account of the government was used each time that the
number of banknotes to be removed from circulation was calculated, as the legal provision
required. In practice, the government gave instructions to the National Bank to buy foreign
exchange on its behalf. Then the Bank printed banknotes to buy foreign exchange on behalf of
the government as it was instructed. Foreign exchange purchased on these terms could be
used for the requirements of the government without special authorisation. In addition, the
government benefitted from any profits whilst at the same time being responsible for any
losses resulting from these transactions.
4.1.3.5. Closing Remarks
On the eve of the central banking reform in Greece, total currency in circulation consisted of
several note-issues added together. The terms of each of these issues were determined by
different legal provisions.
Table 4.4 above indicates the legal maximum for banknotes in circulation, though the
total circulation was usually below this level. At the time of central banking reforms the
number of banknotes in circulation as a result of the 1898 Law of Control and the ΓΧΜΒ Law
did not vary but the remainder did. The banknotes in circulation as a result of the April 1923
decree fluctuated in line with the amount of foreign exchange bought and sold for the account
of the government whilst the banknotes issued because of the note issuing privilege of the
National Bank would change according to the cash transactions of the National Bank. In the
1920s, banknotes issued for the account of the government were reported on the balance sheet
of the National Bank together with banknotes in circulation under its issuing privilege. (See
233 Ibid., p. 7.
234 See Annual Report of the National Bank for 1926 (1927); Zolotas (1928).
155


Table A3.1 in Appendix A3.) These banknotes for the account of the government in fact
represented debt to the bank of issue and decreased as the government cleared it.
Finally, a portion of the banknotes in circulation was collateralised using gold,
foreign exchange and Greek government bonds denominated in gold. For example, the total
number of banknotes in circulation under the decree of April 1923 was covered by foreign
exchange. In addition, one-eighth of the increase in the banknotes issued under the issuing
privilege of the National Bank in 1915 and again in 1920 was covered by gold and a further
one-eighth by bonds of Greek government loans denominated in gold. The remaining notes in
circulation were not covered by any legal reserves.
4.2. National Bank as the Bank of the Government
4.2.1. Introduction
Governments invariably turn to their central banks for financial assistance, in particular
during wars or other crises. The National Bank was no exception. It lent to the government
generously although only reluctantly, not only during periods of war or national disasters but
also during periods that the Greek government had no access to the international financial
markets. Under such circumstances the nationalist argument was usually too strong for the
Bank to refuse its help to the government. As a consequence its financial position weakened
during those periods. When, however, attempts at reconstruction were made, the National
Bank’s aim was to achieve a reduction or a reconstruction of the illiquid public debt that it
owned. This ebb and flow acted as a form of self-regulation that helped the National Bank to
protect its financial strength and credibility during its entire history as a bank of issue. A
financially sound National Bank in turn created the systemic stability that characterised the
Greek banking system.
The National Bank acted as a financial ambassador for the Greek government abroad
when foreign loans were contracted, and usually underwrote any portion issued in Athens.
Furthermore, governors of the National Bank moved to the Ministry of Finance during
turbulent periods or had been members of the parliament. The most prominent case was that
of Stefanos Streit, who served as governor of the National Bank between 1896 and 1910. In
1897, Streit became minister of finance, a post that he held for two years until the enactment
of the Law of Control and the flotation of the 1898 Loan under the aegis of the Great Powers.
For its part, the government deposited all available credit and funds within the National Bank;
156


a precedent that was to be followed by the IFC. In this way, a complex relationship developed
between the government and the issuing bank in the country.
Christina Agriantoni (1986), having focused her research on the nineteenth century,
calls the National Bank the bank of the government because, as she argues, public debt held
by the National Bank after 1877 was a significant item on its balance sheet.235 She compares
credit granted by the National Bank to the private sector of the economy with the public debt
that it held between 1861 and 1900. This comparison shows that from 1885 until 1900 public
debt held by the Bank consistently surpassed credits that had been granted to the private
sectors of the economy. In addition, George Alogoskoufis and Sofia Lazaretou (1997, pp.
136–137) present the percentage share of public debt in the total assets of the National Bank
between 1848 and 1936.236 Their data demonstrate that in the 1860s public debt started
becoming an important item on the balance sheet of the Bank. The percentage share of public
debt held by the National Bank during the period that they examine fluctuated between a
minimum 3.20 per cent experienced in 1861 and a maximum of 55.90 per cent which was
reached in 1898.
These estimates of public debt owned by the National Bank, however, overemphasise
its role as a lender to the government and obscure its conservative and risk-averse character as
a lender. The literature does not distinguish between public debt that the National Bank had
granted to the government because of its role as the central bank in Greece and government
debt denominated either in gold or in drachmae which was traded on stock exchanges.
Government debt that was traded on stock exchanges was a liquid asset on the balance sheet
of the National Bank, an asset that it had, by and large, voluntarily invested in. It also
constituted a source of significant profit. On the other hand, government debt in forced
banknotes, temporary loans and treasury bills held by the National Bank was regarded as a
burden, a portion of its assets that curbed its liquidity and weakened its financial position.
That having said, when the National Bank granted loans to the government, in particular loans
in forced circulation of banknotes it sought to secure special privileges such as an extension
of its issuing right, tax exemptions or the management of public revenues.
235 The source of the data on public debt and credits to the private sectors of the economy used by Agriantoni was Stavros Thomadakis (1981). Nonetheless, Thomadakis’ data on public debt held by the National Bank overstated the Bank’s role as a lender to the government as credit to legal entities was included in public debt. It should also be noted that it is not clear what items Thomadakis included in his estimation of credits to the economy granted by the National Bank.
236 Estimates of the National Bank and public debt also appear in Dertilis (2005, vol. II, pp. 10421050).
157


Notwithstanding the volume of public debt owned by the National Bank, it anyway
played the role of the bank of the government during its entire history as a dual-purpose bank.
The Greek government resorted to it to borrow in particular whenever it could not borrow
either from the domestic market or abroad, and at the same time the National Bank was
responsible for all the business of its own government. Furthermore, the National Bank stood
by the government when it borrowed from abroad. More research, however, should be carried
out to establish the relationship between the government and the bank of issue in Greece in
the nineteenth century.
This part of Chapter 4 examines public debt held by the National Bank between 1898
and 1930. For the first time ever, and for the purpose of this thesis, public debt as it appeared
on the balance sheet of the National Bank is divided into public debt traded on stock
exchanges and government debt that was not traded on secondary markets, and time series
were constructed accordingly. Sovereign debt held by the Bank that was not traded on stock
exchanges includes debt primarily resulting from agreements between the bank of issue and
the government and consisting mainly of forced circulation, temporary or long-term loans,
advances and treasury bills. This debt held by the National Bank is referred to in this thesis as
bilateral or illiquid public debt in contrast to public debt that was traded on secondary markets
and thus was liquid.
The time series of illiquid public debt owned by the bank of issue and constructed for
the purpose of this thesis are compared with the time series of credits granted by the National
Bank to the private sectors of the economy and presented in the previous chapter. This
comparison demonstrates the importance of commercial activities to the National Bank on the
eve of the outbreak of the Balkan Wars. It also shows how significant this aspect of their
business remained when the League of Nations was being approached in 1927. Finally, this
exercise illustrates changes that a long period of war and its aftermath brought to the
commercial character of the National Bank and to its role as a bank of the government.
Highlighting these changes will later help in understanding what the governors of the
National Bank sought to achieve through stabilisation in 1927.
The period in question is divided into two sub-periods. The first sub-period starts with
the enactment of the Law of Control and finishes with the outbreak of the Balkan Wars. This
is a period of relative peace, economic growth and expansion for the National Bank. The
second sub-period covers the period from the outbreak of the Balkan Wars until after the
implementation of a League sponsored stabilisation scheme. This is a long period of wars,
monetary upheaval and finally reconstruction. The main objective here is to examine the role
158


of the bank of issue as a lender to the government during two very distinct and contrasting
eras and thus to shed light on the way that the National Bank combined central banking
functions with commercial activities. In addition, the analysis of the two very different
periods will help to demonstrate the changes that a long period of war and its aftermath
brought to the National Bank.
4.2.2. Public Debt and the National Bank during a period of stability, 1898–1911
4.2.2.1. The 1893 default, domestic public debt and the banks of issue
The enactment of the Law of Control and the concomitant debt restructuring changed the
relationship between the National Bank and the government. The Law of Control introduced a
legal framework that strictly defined the relationship of the National Bank with the
government; forced currency in circulation had gradually to be reduced and a limit was set to
the number of treasury bills that the government could issue. No further borrowing of the
government was allowed from the bank of issue without the consent of the IFC.
In December 1893, the Greek government suspended sinking fund payments of all
external public debt whilst coupon payments were restricted to 30 per cent of their original
interest rate. On the other hand, the service of the domestic public debt denominated both in
gold and nominal drachmae continued to be paid in full.237 Valaorites ([1902] 1988, pp. 137
141) in his book on the National Bank defended this preferential treatment that domestic
public debt had received by arguing that this decision to exempt domestic government debt
from default was based on public interest. The three privileged banks, as Valaorites called the
issuing banks in Greece at the time, i.e. the National Bank, the Ionian Bank and the Bank of
Epirus-Thessaly, held most of the domestic public debt. In case of a suspension of the service of
domestic public debt, he argued, the financial position of the issuing banks would have been
seriously damaged.
In 1898, the Law of Control provided for a restructuring of all domestic debt. Several
loans denominated in drachmae were consolidated into one loan without any reduction in
their capital.238 The capital of this Unified Loan as it is known, was 76,354,000 drachmae
divided into 763,540 bonds, its interest rate 5 per cent and its amortisation period 80 years.239
In addition, the floating debt denominated in gold which consisted entirely of loans and
advances from the banks of issue, was converted into bonds of the 2.50 per cent Loan of
1898. This conversion left interest charge virtually unchanged. In this way, the banks of issue

159


acquired an asset that could be easily converted into gold, in particular when they would
attempt to resume specie payments.240
The main arguments in favour of the preferential handling of the domestic
government debt were as follows. Firstly, all bondholders of the domestic public debt already
had experienced a reduction of interest rate as early as 1888, when the Tricoupis government
had reduced the interest rate charged on these loans and simultaneously abolished sinking
fund payments. Secondly, domestic debt was mainly denominated in drachmae which meant
in a currency which had severely depreciated since these loans were issued. Finally, the
conversion involved a small reduction in interest rate.241
It is unfortunate that not much is known about the negotiations for a debt compromise
which eventually led to the enactment of the Law of Control in 1898. Andreades (1939, n. 5,
p. 478) remarked that no minutes were taken during the negotiations.242 Thus, the positions or
the recommendations of the different participants are not known. In particular, it would have
been worthwhile knowing the role that Stefanos Streit, the governor of the National Bank
played in his capacity as minister of finance and chief representative of Greece in the
negotiations. Details of the negotiations that resulted in the reconstruction of the domestic
public debt which was mainly held by the National Bank would have been particularly helpful
in further understanding the methods that the National Bank employed to protect its own
financial strength whilst at the same time looking after the financial needs of the government.
It was, however, evident that both in 1893 and in 1898 special attention was paid to
the banks of issue. Valaorites, in his book on the history of the National Bank, first published
in 1902, commended that the 1898 debt consolidation was one of the most important events in
its history up to then. He then added that it was perhaps the most important event in terms of
establishing a sound base for the bank, because it signified the end of a period where the Bank
depended entirely on the financial adventures of the government.243
4.2.2.2. Presentation of public debt held by the National Bank, 1898–1911
Table 4.6 presents the public debt that the National Bank held between 1898 and 1911. It is
divided into debt in government bonds that were traded on stock exchanges and other public
debt, primarily illiquid debt that the National Bank owned. In addition, the percentage share

of each category of public debt in total assets is presented. A general point that can be made is
that both types of government debt on the balance sheet of the National Bank decreased as a
percentage of its total assets during the period in question.

Government debt traded on stock exchanges fell from 24 per cent in 1898 to approximately
13 per cent of its assets in 1911. This decrease was mainly due to a remarkable expansion of
the balance sheet of the National Bank and not to a notable reduction in the value of public
debt traded on secondary markets that the Bank held. In addition, the outstanding capital of
the total illiquid public debt held by the National Bank had been reduced by approximately 25
per cent by 1911. Its share, however, in the total assets of the Bank experienced a more
remarkable reduction again because of the expansion of the National Bank during this period;
it fell from nearly 30 per cent in 1898 to roughly 12 per cent in 1911.

Table 4.7 demonstrates that the illiquid public debt held by the National Bank consisted of
banknotes issued as forced circulation, treasury bills and temporary loans in gold and
drachmae. The domestic debt consolidation that the Law of Control introduced limited the
illiquid public debt that the National Bank owned mainly to that derived from forced
circulation. Moreover, as is explained above in section 4.1.1 of this chapter the Law of
Control set a strict timetable for the reduction of forced banknotes in circulation; from 1900
onwards at least 2 million drachmae of forced circulation had to be repaid each year until the
government’s indebtedness to the bank of issue in banknotes of forced circulation was
reduced to 40 million drachmae. Finally, according to the Law of Control the government
could issue treasury bills up to 10 million drachmae.
Consequently, from the enactment of the Law of Control up to the Balkan Wars
illiquid public debt held by the National Bank was mainly confined to forced banknotes in
circulation. Treasury bills and temporary loans to the government remained insignificant as
Table 4.7 above demonstrates.

Table 4.8 shows the liquid debt held by the National Bank, that is to say government debt
held by the bank of issue which was traded on secondary markets. Public debt traded on stock
exchanges was an investment for the Bank and consisted of bonds of loans that were
denominated either in gold or in paper drachmae.
The National Bank, possibly on the eve of the announcement of default in 1893
embarked on a massive sale of bonds of government debt denominated in gold that were kept
in its portfolio.244 They only maintained bonds of the Piraeus-Larissa Railway Loan of 1890
and the Funding Loan of 1893. Presumably a sale of bonds of the Funding Loan would have
accrued excessive loss to the National Bank.245
As Table 4.9 shows, at the end of 1898 the portfolio of the National Bank consisted of
bonds denominated in gold of the Railway Loan of 1890, the Funding Loan of 1893 and of
the 1898 Guaranteed Loan. The National Bank obtained 8,042 bonds of the 2.50 per cent
Guaranteed Loan, as Table 4.9 shows, from the conversion of the floating debt in gold that it

owned. Initially, it was proposed that all these bonds would be deposited at the Bank of
France and the National Bank would not be able either to withdraw or sell them without the
consent of the IFC. At the end, however, the 2,658 bonds of the 1898 Loan, which the
National Bank obtained because of the conversion of the temporary loans and advances were
left at the free disposal of the Bank and were deposited at the Bank of England as the terms
offered where better. The remaining 5,384 bonds of the 2.50 per cent Guaranteed Loan of
1898, which the National Bank took for the conversion of the floating debt in metallic, were
also deposited at the Bank of England with the consent of both the IFC and the Bank of
France. This latter set of bonds, however, was not at the free disposal of the National Bank of
Greece.
As Table 4.9 shows, after the restructuring of the Greek government debt in 1898 the
portfolio of the National Bank consisted of bonds denominated in gold of the Railway Loan
of 1890, the Funding Loan of 1893 and the 1898 Guaranteed Loan. On the other hand, its
portfolio of bonds denominated in drachmae was confined to bonds of the Unified Loan of
1898.

Table 4.8 indicates that the National Bank restructured its portfolio in government bonds
during the period in question. Government bonds in paper drachmae were reduced in favour
of bonds denominated in gold. By contrast, in 1898 the bulk of debt in government bonds in
the National Bank’s portfolio was in bonds denominated in paper drachmae.

4.2.3. Public Debt and the National Bank: from the Balkan Wars until Stabilisation
4.2.3.1. Introduction
The Balkan Wars signalled a change in the relationship between the bank of issue and the
government that lasted until stabilisation. The Law of Control was repeatedly violated during
this period and the transparent and uncomplicated relationship between the Greek government
and the National Bank that had prevailed during the first decade of the twentieth century, gave
way to a complex financial relationship shaped by the historical conjuncture. During this
period which included a long period of war, the Asia Minor debacle and a consequent
increase in the population of the country swelled by more than a million refugees, the bank of
issue proved to be an unfailing source of financial support for the Greek government.
The complexity in the relationship that developed between the bank of issue and the
government is illustrated very vividly in the balance sheet of the National Bank during the
period in question. This complexity coupled with a lack of transparency in the way that
government debt was reported on the balance sheet of the National Bank makes the
compilation and estimation of government debt granted to the government by the National
Bank, in particular after 1915, a challenging and at the same time very strenuous task.
There follows an attempt to disentangle the complex financial relationship that was
developed between the government and the National Bank during this turbulent period.
Hence, the ways by which the National Bank financially supported the government will be
presented in detail below. Briefly, the National Bank used the printing press several times to
lend to the government up to early 1923, as has been already explained in section 4.1.3 of this
chapter. The ΓΧΜΒ Law was employed by the government to finance Greek participation in
the Great War and in this way the so-called Book Credit agreements with the Allies were
utilised. (See Chapter 5 on the Book Credits opened by the Allies during the active
participation of Greece in the First World War.) At the end, however, banknotes issued on
account of the Book Credits turned into government debt to the bank of issue in the form of
forced banknotes. Moreover, the Bank provided loans both in gold and in drachmae as well as
advances to the government. In the 1920s, the National Bank further supported the
government by guaranteeing, discounting and repaying the NDBs that had been issued. In
addition to these conventional forms of government borrowing from the central bank, the
National Bank on behalf of the Greek government financed the importation of food supplies,
mainly cereals, during the First World War and the Asia Minor campaign. Finally, in 1926 the
National Bank undertook the management and liquidation of Moslem properties in Greece
165


and at the same time the indemnification of urban refugees for their holdings abandoned in
Asia Minor – a task, however, close to the responsibilities of a mortgage bank.
To understand developments in the way that the National Bank financed public
expenditure, the period in question here is divided into three sub-periods: 1912–1923, 1924
1927 and 1928–1930. The first sub-period refers to the long period of war; it covers the
period from the outbreak of the First Balkan War until the signing of the peace Treaty of
Lausanne with Turkey in 1923. The following sub-period starts in 1924 and finishes in 1927;
this is a prolonged period towards stabilisation. Finally, the third sub-period deals with the
banking reform and shows how the relationship of the National Bank with the government
was transformed after the reform.
It should be noted that this is the first time that the relationship of the National Bank
with the government has been approached in such a thorough and detailed way. Previous
studies that have tackled the question present either aggregate data of public debt held by the
National Bank or data of public debt as a percentage of its total assets.246 Since the 1930s, it
has been repeatedly stressed in the literature that the National Bank was overburdened with
government debt during the 1920s. For the first time, however, here the methods followed by
the National Bank to lend to the government are described in detail. In this way, the changes
that happened to the balance sheet of the Bank during the period in question are exposed.
These changes restrained the liquidity of the National Bank, but by no means was its solvency
jeopardised.
4.2.3.2. Government debt traded on stock exchanges, 1912–1930
Here again, as in the period between 1898 and 1911 examined above, government debt held
by the National Bank that was traded on stock exchanges is regarded as belonging to the
portfolio of the Bank and is treated as a liquid investment. Hence, a distinction is made
between government debt traded on stock exchanges and government debt held by the
National Bank that was illiquid and was based on bilateral agreements between the Bank and
the government. It should be stressed that this is a departure from previous research on the
issue in question, where no such distinction is made and both categories of public debt are
treated in the same way.
246 See, for example, Alogoskoufis and Lazaretou (1997, pp. 136–137); Dertilis (2005, vol. II, pp. 1042–1050).
166


As in the period examined in the previous section, there is again here an entry on the
balance sheet of the National Bank entitled ‘Bonds of Public Loans’ where Greek sovereign
debt denominated in gold and traded on secondary markets that the Bank owned was reported.
However, from 1924 to 1927 this asset item does not report only public debt denominated in
gold and traded on stock exchanges. Liquid public debt was amalgamated with illiquid debt
based on bilateral agreements between the bank of issue and the government and was reported
as one on the balance sheet of the National Bank. Nevertheless, it is not possible at this stage
of the research, using the evidence to hand, to distinguish between liquid and illiquid
sovereign debt reported together on the balance sheet of the Bank as ‘Bonds of Public Debt’
in the 1920s.
Between 1915 and 1927, public debt owned by the National Bank that was traded on
stock exchanges should be divided into two categories. Firstly, the Bank held government
bonds denominated in gold and traded on stock exchanges that by law belonged to its gold
and foreign exchange cover as it was the bank of issue in Greece. Government bonds
denominated in gold that were kept as reserves was a prerequisite for the increase in the
banknotes in circulation under the issuing privilege of the National Bank in 1915 and then
again in 1920. As has been explained above in section 4.1.3, one-eighth of the increase in the
banknotes in circulation, because of the extension of the note privilege of the National Bank
both in 1915 and in 1920, had to be covered by gold and a further one-eighth by bonds of
Greek government loans denominated in gold and traded on secondary markets. Secondly, in
a separate category can be included public debt owned by the National Bank that was
comprised of bonds of loans denominated either in gold or in drachmae, but on this occasion
they were at its free disposal.

Table 4.10 above presents public debt traded on secondary markets that the Bank owned
between 1912 and 1930. Firstly, sovereign debt denominated in gold that the National Bank
was required by law to keep as reserves is presented separately in the last column of Table
4.10. In 1927, the way that assets and liabilities were reported on the balance sheet of the
National Bank changed. During that year, Greek government debt denominated in gold that
was maintained as cover was added to the rest of the public debt in gold that the Bank owned.
Secondly, Table 4.10 shows public debt denominated in gold and in drachmae held by
National Bank. As has been explained above, between 1924 and 1927 public debt
denominated in drachmae and traded on secondary markets was amalgamated with bilateral
government debt in drachmae. It is not possible, however, using available evidence to
distinguish between public debt owned by the Bank that was denominated in drachmae and
traded on secondary markets and bilateral, illiquid public debt reported together on the
balance sheet of the National Bank and presented in Table 4.10 above. The latter stemmed
168


from bilateral agreements between the National Bank and the government. Thirdly, Table
4.10 indicates the stock of sovereign debt traded on secondary markets that the National Bank
retained after the banking reform.
Sovereign debt owned by the National Bank that was denominated in gold and traded
on stock exchanges was undervalued by the way that it was reported on its balance sheet in
the 1920s. Furthermore, it would be incorrect to add together gold drachmae and paper
drachmae. In other words, it will be misleading to follow the accountancy practice adopted by
the Bank itself during the monetary upheaval of the 1920s. The real value of the public debt
denominated in gold and traded on stock exchanges that the National Bank owned was higher
than that reported on its balance sheet during the 1920s when it remained a central bank.
4.2.3.3. Illiquid public debt held by the National Bank, 1912–1930
Table 4.11 shows illiquid government debt held by the National Bank between the outbreak
of the Balkan Wars and stabilisation as accurately as is possible. It presents loans to the
government in forced circulation and loans in gold and drachmae granted by the National
Bank using its own reserves as well as advances. The balance sheet of the National Bank is
the main source of the information displayed in this table. Adjustments have been made
where necessary, and of course possible, using information provided by the governor of the
Bank in his annual report, as well as evidence from a variety of other sources.

During the Balkan Wars the National Bank granted temporary loans in gold to the
government. It is noteworthy that although the drachma had remained stable since 1910 these
temporary loans were contracted in gold. These temporary loans, however, did not place any
strain on the National Bank. In fact, in 1914 the Greek government entered into its largest
borrowing agreement prior to the outbreak of the Great War. Of the total amount issued under
the 1914 Loan, 25.95 per cent was given by the government to the bank of issue to clear its
debt that had arisen out of the conflict.247
Illiquid public debt because of the issuing privilege
Government debt held by the National Bank in forced circulation presented in Table 4.11 is
divided into three categories. The first category, headed A, shows debt in banknotes that had
been issued in the nineteenth century and regulated by the Law of Control. As has been
explained above, the Law of Control introduced in 1898 stipulated that from 1900 onwards
the government had the obligation to cancel banknotes to the value of at least 2 million
drachmae every year until the debt in banknotes fell to 40 million drachmae. As Table 4.11
shows, this provision of the Law of Control was observed even in the 1920s when the Law of
Control no longer operated and the printing press was used liberally, as the adjacent column B
of this table shows. The 40 million drachmae target stipulated by the Law of Control was
achieved in 1925 and subsequently it remained unchanged until the establishment of the Bank
of Greece. Public debt to the National Bank regulated by the Law of Control is the only part
of illiquid government debt in Table 4.11 that was precisely and consistently presented on the
balance sheet of the National Bank during the entire period in question. As it will become
evident below, the remainder of the bilateral public debt held by the National Bank cannot be
estimated as accurately and presented as easily as has been the government debt in forced
247 For more, see Christodoulaki and Penzer (2004, p. 17).


circulation regulated by the Law of Control. This again points to the complexities in the
relationship between the government and the National Bank that developed gradually after the
outbreak of the First Balkan War.
As Table 4.4 above shows, the printing press was employed for the first time by the
National Bank to lend to the government in 1920 and by March 1923 it had been used in total
five times. Government debt to the bank of issue because of the use of the printing press in
the early 1920s is presented in column B of Table 4.11. On the 1924 balance sheet all
government debt from banknotes issued as forced circulation was for the first time gathered
together in a single entry. Previously, the forced circulation resulting from the 2547 law of
1920 had been included with temporary loans in drachmae. An attempt has been made in
Table 4.11, using evidence from the annual report of the National Bank to present together all
government debt arising out of banknotes having been issued for the account of the
government since 1920. It should be noted that the law of 19 April 1921 provided not only for
the 500 million drachmae loan of forced banknotes but a further 50 million drachmae loan at
5.50 per cent from the reserves of the National Bank. On the balance sheet of the National
Bank, this 50 million drachmae loan was added together with debt to the government because
of forced circulation. No evidence has been found which specifies the remaining balance of
this loan at the end of each year so as to integrate it with the other temporary loans. It should
also be stated that there is a noticeable discrepancy between the balance of all loans of forced
circulation at the end of 1927 shown in Table 4.11 and their balance on 14 May 1928,
indicated in Table 4.4 above. This discrepancy can be explained partly by the fact that the 50
million drachmae loan referred to above is included with forced circulation on the balance
sheet of the National Bank.
Column C of Table 4.11 reports debt of the government to the National Bank from
Allied Book Credits. The Book Credits of the Allies are examined in detail in Chapter 5,
which deals with public finance during the period in question. It should, however, be repeated
briefly here that the ΓΧΜΒ Law was used by the government to finance active participation
in the Great War. Under an agreement signed in Paris in early 1918 Britain, France and the
USA opened Book Credits in equal shares to the Greek government to a total value of 750
million French francs. In addition, this Paris Agreement between the Allies stipulated that the
National Bank would grant credits to the British and French armies stationed in Macedonia.
In May 1919, a supplementary agreement was signed and a further 100 million French francs
of Book Credits were granted to Greece by the Allies under the same terms and conditions as
those of the 1918 agreement. On the strength of these Book Credits, the National Bank printed
banknotes that were passed on to the government to meet the expenses of the armed forces.
172


Banknotes were also printed by the Bank to grant credit to the Allied army in Macedonia. Here,
Book Credits is used as a generic term which refers to the 1918 and 1919 agreements between
the Greek government and the Allies and to the agreement between the National Bank on the
one hand, and on the other France and Britain that authorised the former to grant credit to the
French and British army stationed in Macedonia. According to their agreement, these Book
Credits could be drawn upon by the Greek government six months after the conclusion of peace.
The Allies repudiated the Book Credits in December 1920. (For more on this see
Chapter 5.) Consequently, the banknotes in circulation because of the Book Credits were no
longer covered by the credits in foreign exchange promised by the Allies. Hence, the Book
Credits were turned into banknotes in forced circulation. In other words, the banknotes in
circulation that had been issued on the strength of the Book Credits were in effect turned into
government debt in forced circulation to the bank of issue. In spite of the fact, however, that the
Allies had repudiated the Book Credits, the National Bank continued to report them on its
balance sheet as ‘reserves abroad because of the ΓΧΜΒ Law’. This ‘reserves abroad because of
the ΓΧΜΒ Law’ in the assets of the balance sheet of the National Bank has been very
misleading for researchers who are not familiar with the historical period in question.
Nevertheless, the persistent inclusion of this entry on the balance sheet of the National Bank
until the banking reform encapsulates vividly the expectations of successive Greek
governments, as well as of the governors of the National Bank, that eventually the Book
Credits would be realised.
In 1922, the Book Credits that had not been granted by the Allies, but on the strength
of which the National Bank had printed banknotes, were consolidated. Subsequently, this
consolidated figure of Book Credits appeared on the balance sheet of the National Bank until
the banking reform as ‘reserves abroad because of the ΓΧΜΒ Law’. It should be repeated that
in this thesis the Book Credits that had not been granted by the Allies, but on the strength of
which the Greek government had printed banknotes, are treated as government debt in forced
circulation and appear in column headed C of Table 4.11. In this table, the consolidated figure
of Book Credits that was reported on the balance sheet in 1922 has been included as
government debt in forced circulation to the bank of issue retrospectively for 1920 and 1921.
This is justified by the fact that the Book Credits were cancelled in December 1920.
In the annual report of the National Bank for 1919 its governor stated the amount of
foreign exchange reserves abroad because of the ΓΧΜΒ Law that indeed represented Book
173


Credits both in 1918 and 1919.248 In retrospect, however, what the governor of the National
Bank reported in his annual report for 1919 as foreign exchange reserves abroad on the
strength of the Book Credits was in reality, government debt in forced circulation. For this
reason, the amount that the governor stated as foreign exchange reserves abroad covered by
the Allied Book Credits in 1918 as well as in 1919 has been included in column C of Table
4.11 as government debt in forced circulation to the bank of issue.249 These two figures are
presented in italics.
It should be noted that this is the first time that Allied Book Credits have been
regarded as government debt in forced circulation to the National Bank. Previous studies of
the period in question view the Allied Book Credits as foreign exchange reserves abroad
which, as it has been demonstrated here, is incorrect.
The principles of the ΓΧΜΒ Law were not violated for the first time in 1918.
Previously, in 1915 the ΓΧΜΒ Law was used to open to the Greek government Book Credits
by France, Great Britain and Russia. On the strength of these Book Credits, the National Bank
issued banknotes that were passed over to the government. (These Book Credits are examined
in detail in Chapter 5.) This experiment was repeated again in 1917 and possibly in 1916. No
evidence, however, has been located which indicates the amount of government debt in forced
circulation because of the Book Credits issued during the period of the Great War that Greece
remained neutral. Therefore, between 1915 and 1917 government debt in forced circulation
that is presented in Table 4.11 is understated.
Temporary loans and advances to the government
The rest of Table 4.11 shows temporary loans and advances granted by the National Bank to
the government. The accountancy practice that the National Bank adopted in the 1920s has
been reluctantly followed here so that debt in gold drachmae is added up together with debt of
the government in paper drachmae.
During this turbulent period, on the one hand the government borrowed from the bank
of issue and on the other, used proceeds of these loans to pay back to the National Bank part
of its older obligations. For example, in 1922 the printing press was employed twice and in
total 1,150 million drachmae were issued. A substantial part of the proceeds of these two

loans in forced circulation, to be precise 441 million drachmae, was used by the government
to repay temporary loans and advances that the National Bank had granted to it during the
previous year.250 Furthermore, in 1924 four loans that had been granted by the National Bank
to the government after 1918 were consolidated in a loan of total value of 648 million
drachmae redeemable over a period of 20 years.251 This was a 6 per cent interest rate loan
between the National Bank and the government guaranteed both by special taxation and the
government’s share in the profits of the National Bank. After 1924, this consolidated illiquid
loan in drachmae was reported on the balance sheet of the National Bank, together with other
loans also denominated in drachmae but traded on the Athens Stock Exchange. This change
explains the sharp reduction in temporary loans in drachmae in 1924 that can be detected in
Table 4.11.
Government debt called advances and presented in Table 4.11 was similar to treasury
bills. It was an arrangement that allowed the Ministry of Finance to receive day-to-day credit
from the National Bank. Advances were regulated by conventions made between the
government and the Bank every three months. When the League representatives visited
Athens in April 1927, the maximum amount of credit that the Bank was allowed to advance to
the Treasury was 250 million drachmae, having been increased from 150 million drachmae
that was allowed in December 1926.252 The proceeds of a surtax of 10 per cent on all taxes
and the surplus revenue of the IFC that belonged to the government were earmarked for the
repayment of these advances.
National Defence Bonds and the National Bank
As is explained in Chapter 5 on public finance, the Greek government started issuing treasury
bills known as NDBs in 1918. The cornerstone of the success of these NDBs was the National
Bank. Briefly to repeat that the NDBs were issued by the government but the National Bank
guaranteed their full and prompt repayment. In addition, when they fell due the Bank repaid
them and subsequently the government reimbursed the Bank. Finally, the Bank discounted the
NDBs under certain conditions before their maturity. The National Bank had the right by law
to issue banknotes on its behalf in case the government was unable to settle the balance.
Needless to say, the National Bank never availed itself of this right. (For more on NDBs see
Chapter 5.)

In 1918, NDBs appeared for the first time on the balance sheet of the National Bank as a
liability. Subsequently, ‘National Defence Bonds’ is found as an entry on both sides of the
balance sheet of the National Bank, as Table 4.12 above demonstrates. That same table,
however, indicates that there was a discrepancy between the value of NDBs that was quoted
as an asset and that quoted as a liability. A comparison between Table 4.12 and Tables 5.7
and 5.8 in the chapter that deals with public finance suggests that the entire value of the NDBs
that had been issued was stated as a liability on the balance sheet of the National Bank. This
may have been a way of expressing the responsibilities assumed by the National Bank where
NDBs were concerned. It is also uncertain what the corresponding asset value of NDBs
represented. Probably the entire amount of NDBs that the government could issue was
reported on the asset side of the balance sheet of the National Bank rather than the quantum of
outstanding government debt to the bank of issue stemming from NDBs.
Previous research that tackles the issue of public debt held by the National Bank
during the period in question regards the entire amount of the NDBs that is reported on the
balance sheet of the National Bank as an obligation of the government. This same tradition
was followed by the governor of the National Bank in his annual report for 1920, where he
176


stated the total public debt held by the National Bank during that year.253 The governor of the
Bank included in the figure that he stated as total public debt to the National Bank the entire
amount of the NDBs that appeared as an asset on the balance sheet. The view here, however,
is that if the entire amount of the NDBs found on the assets of the National Bank is treated as
government debt, then public debt to the bank of issue is overstated.
The National Bank had been authorised to repay the NDBs as they matured, as well
as to discount them under certain conditions. It is not, however, known what the outstanding
balance of this account was at the end of each year. This outstanding balance was in fact the
debt of the government to the National Bank because of the NDBs. The rest of the NDBs that
had been issued represented a potential threat to the National Bank as they could be easily
discounted and their maturity period was very short. It is possible that the balance due by the
government to the National Bank because of the NDBs that had either been discounted or
repaid, formed part of the figure stated as discounts amongst the assets of the National Bank.
The governor of the Bank announced in his annual report that this balance was 300 million
drachmae in 1924.254 By the end of 1925, a year that the National Bank experienced a heavy
strain because of the NDBs, this balance had been doubled.255 By contrast, when the League
representatives were in Athens in April 1927 the balance due by the government to the
National Bank because of the NDBs was a mere 2 million drachmae.256 By then, however, the
Second Forced Loan had been issued which settled the question of the NDBs. (For more on
the issue of the settlement of the NDBs, see Chapter 5.)
It would have been good if the outstanding balance of the NDBs due by the
government to the Bank at the end of each year was known. Then, this figure could be added
to the total public debt held by the Bank. Nevertheless, in this thesis the outstanding balance
of the NDBs due by the government to the National Bank reported by the governor in his
annual report for 1924 and 1925 is included in the total public debt held by the Bank during
the period in question. (See Table 4.15 below.)
Financing food importation during the war
So far, conventional measures that are used by a central bank to financially support the
government have been discussed here. The National Bank lent to the government using the

printing press and provided loans and advances as well. It also played an instrumental role in
the issue of the NDBs, which resembled treasury bills. The contribution, however, of the bank
of issue to government finance during the period in question did not end there. The National
Bank was further involved in financing food importation during the First World War and the
Asia Minor campaign. Finally, after 1926 the Bank was engaged itself in the indemnification
of urban refugees for their property left behind in Asia Minor, which in the end involved
government lending.
Soon after the outbreak of the First World War the National Bank was involved in the
importation of food supplies such as cereals in addition to sulphur and copper sulphate.257
Initially, the National Bank was authorised not only to purchase wheat, flour and other cereals
for the account of the government but it was also made responsible for their sale and
distribution within the country. However, the government was accountable for any loss that
could accrue to the Bank from the operation. In 1915, a government committee undertook the
importation and distribution of food supplies whilst the role of the National Bank still
remained imperative. The National Bank continued financing the entire operation. Finally, a
Ministry of Food Provisions was established in 1917. The National Bank, however, still
remained responsible for the finance of the importation of cereals until the Ministry was
dissolved in the autumn of 1923.
257 For a detailed account of these operations and their evolution see Eulambio (1924, pp. 179–235).

The balance due by the government to the National Bank at the end of each year because of
the importation of cereals and other materials is presented in Table 4.13 above. This
outstanding balance constituted part of the floating debt of the government. Government debt
to the National Bank because of the importation of food supplies to Greece stopped appearing
on the balance sheet of the latter after 1926. Nevertheless, this is misleading since the floating
debt of the government due to the National Bank because of the importation of cereals was
not settled in 1926. Instead, it is probable that it was integrated with other government debt
held by the National Bank. It is known that in March 1932 the remaining balance of this
account was still 61.90 million drachmae. 258
Indemnification of urban refugees
A 1923 Lausanne Convention for the exchange of Greek and Turkish population provided for
the liquidation of the refugee properties both in Greece and Turkey and the subsequent
indemnification of the owners. In the literature on the issue in question, these properties are
called in brief ‘exchangeable properties’, meaning in this case the property left in Greece by
Moslem emigrants who were transferred to Turkey, and occasionally the refugees are referred
to as ‘exchanged populations’. These terms have also been adopted here.
258 Aggelopoulos (1937, p. 260).
179


The exchangeable properties consisted of rural estates and houses, which were
granted to the RSC for the agricultural settlement, and of urban property.259 In 1926, the urban
property of Moslem populations abandoned in Greece was transferred by the government to
the National Bank, authorising the latter to manage and gradually sell it at auction. Initially,
the value of these properties was estimated at approximately 4,500 million drachmae.260 New
property was added later and their total value came up to nearly 5,125 million drachmae.261
Liquidation of these properties, however, could easily extend over a period of years. For this
reason, on the strength of these urban exchangeable properties, the National Bank was
authorised to issue a series of bonds that were handed over to urban refugees as indemnity for
their property abandoned in Asia Minor. Special committees were established which received
the claims of the urban refugees, verified them and in return gave them a number of bonds
representing a certain percentage of the value of their property in Asia Minor. These bonds
were guaranteed by the government, carried an 8 per cent interest rate and were redeemable at
par in proportion as the Moslem exchangeable urban properties were sold by the National
Bank.262 In addition, the urban refugees could obtain in cash from the National Bank the
equivalent of one-fifth of the value of the bonds they were entitled to. In return, the National
Bank received from the refugees a corresponding amount of bonds.
At first, against the pledged Moslem urban properties, bonds guaranteed by the
government were issued to the value of 3,125 million drachmae. At the same time, an
agreement between the government and the National Bank authorised the latter to pay in cash
to the refugees 20 per cent of the nominal value of the bonds that they were entitled to
receive. In other words, the National Bank could make cash payments to urban refugees up to
625 million drachmae and in return would accept a corresponding amount of bonds.
On 31 December 1926, the cash payments by the National Bank to urban refugees in
exchange of bonds amounted to approximately 172 million drachmae.263 (See Table 4.14.) A
few months later, on 20 May 1927, the cash payments to urban refugees were 613 million
drachmae, which means that they had nearly reached the maximum allowed by law.264 It was
decided then firstly, that the 8 per cent bonds that the National Bank had received in exchange
for cash could be distributed back to urban refugees. Secondly, the National Bank could
increase the cash payments to them. Finally, a new agreement between the government and
259 See Pentzopoulos (1962, pp. 68, 117 and 147).

the National Bank authorised the latter to issue a new series of bonds for the indemnification
of urban refugees for their property abandoned in Asia Minor.
At the end, two loans were issued which are known as ‘Loans of the Exchangeable’.
The total amount of bonds granted to urban refugees as indemnity for their property in Asia
Minor came up to over 6 billion drachmae.265 In addition, the National Bank granted cash to
urban refugees of nearly 900 million drachmae without having received in exchange any
bonds as collateral from the refugees.266 Hence, by the end of 1932 the cost of the
indemnification of urban refugees for their property abandoned in Asia Minor had come up to
nearly 7 billion drachmae whilst the estimated value of the urban exchangeable property was
approximately 5 billion drachmae, which suggests that public money was also employed.267

Table 4.14 above indicates the outstanding balance at the end of each year of all the accounts
on the balance sheet of the National Bank which were related to the indemnification of urban
refugees and the urban exchangeable properties that the Bank had agreed to manage and
liquidate gradually. The National Bank retained this business after the banking reform. The
last column of Table 4.14 shows this business of the National Bank that is related to the
indemnification of urban refugees as a percentage of its assets after the banking reform. It is
265 See Aegides (1934, pp. 40–41). The total amount of bonds issued equalled 6,121,921,000 drachmae. It should be noted that when Venizelos returned to power in the summer of 1928 he pursued a reduction in the interest rate of all outstanding bonds from eight per cent to six per cent. However, as a change in the terms of the bonds that had been already issued was not possible, a compromise was reached: the outstanding bonds remained at eight per cent whilst all the bonds that were circulated subsequently were issued at six per cent.
266 The exact figure of the cash that the National Bank granted without receiving any collateral was 870,958,144 drachmae. See Aegides (1934, pp. 40–41).
267 The total cost of the indemnification of urban refugees had come to 6,992,879,144 drachmae by 31 December 1932. See Aegides (1934, pp. 40–41).
181


noticeable that it constituted a significant part of the business that the National Bank
maintained after the reform.
The credit granted by the National Bank to urban refugees in agreement with the
government takes the lion’s share, as is shown in Table 4.14. Part of this credit was
collateralised with bonds issued on the strength of Moslem urban exchangeable properties.
These bonds did not represent government debt as they were to be paid by the proceeds of the
liquidation of Moslem urban properties. In addition, the National Bank had the right to sell
these bonds gradually in a span of four years on the Athens Stock Exchange after 1 July
1931.268
As has been explained above the National Bank also granted credit to urban refugees
without receiving in return a corresponding amount of bonds. The credit that the National
Bank distributed to urban refugees and was not collateralised with bonds was indeed an
obligation of the government. This credit formed part of the floating debt of the government
and should be added to the public debt held by the National Bank. So far, however, no
evidence has been located indicating the amount of credit that the National Bank had granted
year on year without collateral to urban refugees.
It is known that the total cash that the National Bank granted to urban refugees
without collateral was nearly 900 million drachmae.269 It is not known, however, the amount
of cash at the end of each year that the National Bank had provided to urban refugees without
any collateral so that it can be included in the total public debt that the National Bank held, as
shown in Table 4.15.

All public debt based on agreements between the government and the bank of issue from the
outbreak of the Balkan Wars until the establishment of the Bank of Greece is gathered
together in Table 4.15. In spite of the effort that has been made, it has not been possible to
collect all the different amounts of government debt owed to the Bank. In Table 4.15, x
denotes where data are missing. In spite of the fact that the data on bilateral public debt
presented in Table 4.15 are nearly complete, the arguments made below about the changes
that happened to the balance sheet of the National Bank are correct. If the data are located
then all the comments and observations made will be strengthened as illiquid public debt held
by the National Bank will be increased.
Table 4.15 illustrates the complex relationship between the government and the
National Bank that was created between the outbreak of the Balkan Wars and the banking
reform. Furthermore, this table shows the methods that Greek governments used in order to
finance public expenditure during such a turbulent period when they had no direct access to
the financial markets. Indeed, if the total of the NDBs that had been issued as well as the
proceeds of the two forced loans are added up together with the bilateral government debt
held by the National Bank, then the outcome will show the stock of the domestic public debt
that was created during the period in question. Therefore, the bank of issue proved to be the
main source of financial support for the government. Participation in the First World War and
the Asia Minor campaign were primarily financed by the National Bank. After the end of a
long period of war, the National Bank continued its support to the government, although this
time it was mainly confined to NDBs and advances. Achieving stabilisation of the drachma
meant that they had to signal a change in their policy. Subsequently, the adoption of the gold
exchange standard and the statutes of the new central bank led to the introduction of a legal
framework which redefined the relationship of the central bank with the government.
Government borrowing from the newly established Bank of Greece was strictly curtailed.
Table 4.15 shows that the National Bank played an imperative role in channelling
funds to the government during a period of turmoil when the Greek government had no access
to financial markets. Between 1918 and 1923, the printing press was the main instrument used
to finance public expenditure. Budget deficits were monetised during active participation in


the Great War and the Asia Minor campaign, leading to a monetary instability that the country
had never experienced before. Temporary loans were also contracted between the National
Bank and the government. Table 4.15 also suggests that 1918, with the issue of banknotes
because of the Allied Book Credits, signifies a turning point in the relation between the
central bank and the government, although the ΓΧΜΒ Law had also been violated before. At
the end, the National Bank was encumbered with government debt in forced circulation, in
spite of the official belief that these issues of banknotes were fully covered by foreign
exchange reserves.
Between 1920 and 1923, the printing press was rolled several times. When resort to
the printing press was stopped, the government used treasury bills, the so-called National
Defence Bonds to cover budget deficits. The settlement of the NDBs in 1926 was the first
important step towards stabilisation. The governor of the National Bank pursued a
stabilisation that was accompanied with the flotation of a foreign loan to clear public debt, in
particular government debt in forced circulation, and in this way to strengthen the financial
position of the National Bank. Public debt held by the National Bank in the 1920s created
severe liquidity problems for it. As it is, however, apparent in this thesis, the solvency of the
Bank was never jeopardised during this turbulent period.
After the outbreak of the Balkan Wars, the stipulations of the Law of Control that
defined the relationship between the Greek government and the bank of issue were at first
discretely, and then openly, violated. During the Balkan Wars temporary loans were granted
by the National Bank to the government. Subsequently, the principles upon which the ΓΧΜΒ
Law operated were infringed and in this way the printing press was rolled implicitly. In the
early 1920s, banknotes in favour of the government were overtly issued. In addition, treasury
bills were also being circulated in the form of NDBs.
The period in question here was an exceptionally turbulent period for Greece and it is
not expected that the monetary discipline endorsed by the Law of Control and favoured by the
National Bank would have been or could have been maintained. The legal framework that
defined the relationship of the government with the bank of issue, in this case the Law of
Control, was observed for as long as both the economic conditions and the political economy
in Greece were in favour of it. During the Balkan Wars no attention was paid to it because of
the euphoria that was created by victory and the prospects of the Greek economy with the
annexation of the New Areas. Then, during the First World War the printing press was used
under the Book Credit agreements with the Allies. A new committee, the Inter-Allied
Financial Commission, was established in Athens that oversaw how the Book Credits were
185


spent. During the Asia Minor campaign the ‘nationalist argument’ was too strong for the
Bank to refuse its help to the government.270 Thus, from the outbreak of the First Balkan War
until stabilisation the National Bank became too close to the government. In the 1920s, the
international environment had changed. The Financial Committee of the League of Nations
ruled the waves, promoting the ideas of the Bank of England on monetary orthodoxy and
consequently the relationship between a central bank and its government.
4.2.4. Bilateral public debt held by the National Bank reconsidered, 1898–1930
4.2.4.1. Evolution of illiquid public debt
Table 4.16 demonstrates bilateral public debt held by the National Bank between the
enactment of the Law of Control and the banking reforms of the late 1920s as a percentage of
its total assets. In 1898, illiquid public debt to the National Bank – mainly government debt in
forced circulation – accounted for nearly 29 per cent of its total assets. In 1912, when the First
Balkan War broke out, bilateral public debt held by the National Bank still consisted solely of
government debt in forced circulation which, however, had dropped to approximately 10 per
cent of its total assets. This was the lowest percentage share of bilateral government debt in
terms of the assets of the National Bank since the enactment of the Law of Control. Then
illiquid government debt as a percentage of the assets of the National Bank started increasing,
although by the end of 1917 it had fluctuated severely. It should be reminded that the data for
the period after 1915 and until 1927 are not complete and therefore the total bilateral
government debt presented in Table 4.15, as well as its percentage share in the total assets, is
understated.

Table 4.16 demonstrates unequivocally that 1918 was a turning point in the relationship
between the government and the National Bank. Bilateral public debt on the balance sheet of
the National Bank corresponded to nearly 41 per cent of its assets in 1918, whilst the year
before it had been only 10 per cent. The following year it increased to approximately 60 per
cent. As it has been repeatedly explained, there is no point extending this exercise into the
1920s because of the accountancy practices followed by the National Bank during the
monetary upheaval. Bilateral government debt, however, held by the National Bank during
187


the 1920s remained a significant percentage of its assets, pointing out the liquidity problems
that the Bank experienced during that period.
It is unfortunate that there are no data on bilateral public debt held by the National
Bank for the period before the enactment of the Law of Control that could be compared with
the time series constructed in this thesis for the period 1898 to 1930. In this way, the
experience of the National Bank as a lender to the government during its entire history as a
bank of issue could be evaluated and general conclusions could be drawn. Nonetheless, it is
possible that bilateral government borrowing from the National Bank between 1918 and 1927
reached unprecedented high levels in its entire history as the bank of the government.
Figure 4.5: Bilateral public debt held by the National Bank as a percentage of GDP, 1898–1930 Source: Table A2.14 in Appendix A2.
Both Figure 4.5 and Table A2.14 in Appendix A2 demonstrate bilateral government debt
owned by the National Bank between the enactment of the Law of Control and the central
banking reform as a percentage of GDP. They show that between 1898 and 1911 bilateral
public debt held by the National Bank as a percentage of GDP fell steadily. This fall was due
on the one hand to a slow but steady decrease in the illiquid public debt held by the National
Bank and on the other to a significant increase in GDP. (See Table A2.15 where the time
series of illiquid public debt in nominal drachmae for the entire period in question is
presented and Table A1.2 in Appendix A1 for GDP data.)

Between 1912 and 1917, bilateral public debt held by the National Bank as a
percentage of GDP fluctuated from year to year. Figure 4.5, where illiquid public debt is
presented as a percentage of GDP, shows that 1918 was a watershed. After 1918, the
percentage share of bilateral public debt in GDP increased significantly, reaching
exceptionally high levels. For example, in 1921 bilateral public debt held by the National
Bank accounted for half of GPD of that year. Subsequently, the percentage share of illiquid
public debt owned by the National Bank as a percentage of GDP shrank and by 1927 it
represented merely 14 per cent of GDP. This is a moderate estimate since, as has been noted,
the data are not complete. If the data had been complete then illiquid public debt held by the
National Bank as a percentage of GDP in 1927 would have been shown to have been between
17 per cent and 20 per cent. This significant decrease of bilateral government debt of the
National Bank as a percentage of GDP was due, to a large extent, to high inflation in the
1920s. Illiquid public debt had not decreased notably by 1927, as is demonstrated in Table
4.15. On the other hand, Kostelenos et al. (2007) data on GDP in nominal drachmae show that
it increased rapidly in the 1920s – an increase that was primarily inflationary. This suggests
that high inflation wiped out a significant part of the burden of bilateral government debt
which was denominated in drachmae.
A last attempt will be made to appraise developments in the relationship of the
National Bank with the government between the enactment of the Law of Control and the
banking reform. This time the data of illiquid government debt owned by the National Bank is
converted to constant 1911 values using Kostelenos et al. (2007) deflator. The result is
presented in Table A2.15. Subsequently, as Table A2.15 shows, bilateral public debt at
constant values was transformed into a ratio form where 1911 is again the base year. In this
way, the proportionate change in the total stock of bilateral public debt at 1911 values that the
National Bank held becomes evident. In addition, the evolution of bilateral government debt
denominated in drachmae is also examined.
Figure 4.6, where illiquid government debt at 1911 values is graphically depicted,
echoes Figure 4.5, which illustrates bilateral government debt as a percentage of GDP as well
as Table 4.16 which shows bilateral public debt held by the National Bank as a percentage of
its assets. Once again, the increase in the bilateral public debt that the National Bank held
between the Balkan Wars and de jure stabilisation of the drachma is manifested in Figure 4.6.
Between 1911 and 1917 bilateral government debt held by the National Bank at constant
values fluctuated and its level in 1917 was close to that observed in 1911. This observation is
consistent with previous comments made when bilateral public debt owned by the Bank was
189


examined as a percentage of its assets and of GDP. Furthermore, 1918 is again displayed as a
turning point.
Figure 4.6: Total bilateral public debt held by the National Bank at 1911 values as a ratio, 1898–1930 (1911=100) Source: See Table A2.15 in Appendix A2.
Figure 4.6 shows that between 1918 and 1927 bilateral government debt at 1911 values held
by the National Bank ballooned. After 1918 it increased remarkably reaching exceptionally
high levels. As Figure 4.6 above shows, high inflation in the 1920s wiped out a significant
part of the nominal value of bilateral public debt denominated in drachmae that the National
Bank owned. High inflation, however, did not eliminate public debt denominated in
drachmae. In 1927, bilateral government debt at 1911 values still remained approximately
three and a half times higher than it had been before the outbreak of the Balkan Wars. This is
a good proxy, given that the data on bilateral government debt compiled in Table 4.15 are not
complete.
Most of the illiquid public debt held by the National Bank in 1928 was passed to the
newly established Bank of Greece during the reform. The Old Bank, that is to say the
National Bank, maintained some illiquid government debt mainly in temporary loans and the
outstanding floated debt related to the NDBs as well as to the importation of food supplies on
behalf of the government during the First World War and the Asia Minor campaign.

During the central banking reforms, one-third of the Stabilisation Loan of 1928, that
is to say 3 million pounds sterling, was used by the government for the repayment of illiquid
government debt to the bank of issue, by this time the Bank of Greece. In this way, the
reserve position of the newly established central bank was strengthened and at the same time
illiquid public debt created during the period of war and monetary upheaval was converted
into government debt denominated in gold and traded on stock exchanges. At the end,
however, the illiquid public debt that the Bank of Greece inherited from its predecessor
represented 47.41 per cent of its total assets on the day that it opened its doors for operations.

271 The term ‘bank of the government’ is used here to denote the importance of illiquid public debt on the balance sheet of the National Bank comparing it with credits granted to the economy borrowed from Agriantoni (1986). As has been stated above, the National Bank was in any event the bank of the government.
192


Figure 4.7: Bilateral public debt held by the National Bank compared to credits to the economy, 1898–1930 Source: Table 4.17.
In Table 4.17 and Figure 4.7, illiquid government debt held by the National Bank is compared
with total credits granted to the economy during the entire period in question. After the
enactment of the Law of Control the National Bank gradually increased credits to the
economy, reinforcing in this way its commercial aspect. However, illiquid public debt held by
the bank of issue, slowly but steadily, decreased until the Balkan Wars. As a result, in 1911
bilateral public debt which was comprised of banknotes in forced circulation represented only
30 per cent of credits to the economy. By contrast, at the end of 1898, when the floating debt
of the government had been restructured following the introduction of the Law of Control, the
illiquid public debt that the National Bank retained was approximately equal to total credits
that it had granted to the economy.
Although illiquid public debt increased more rapidly than credits to the economy
between the outbreak of the Balkan Wars and active participation of Greece in the First World
War, it still remained a fraction of total credits to the economy supplied by the National Bank.
Table 4.17 shows that the relationship between credits to the economy and bilateral public
debt held by the National Bank changed fundamentally after 1918. In 1918, illiquid
government debt was approximately three and a half times higher than credits to the
economy. Indeed, from 1918 to the establishment of the Bank of Greece in 1928, bilateral
public debt persistently exceeded credits to the economy: illiquid public debt on the balance

sheet of the National Bank was several times higher than credits to the economy, as Table
4.17 and Figure 4.7 demonstrate. In 1924, credit granted to the economy in nominal terms
increased by nearly twofold. This increase meant that the ratio of public debt to credits to the
economy dropped abruptly; in 1924 illiquid public debt held by the National Bank was
roughly 2.20 times higher than private credits to the economy or in other words, credits
provided to the economy represented approximately 45 per cent of bilateral public debt held
by the Bank. It should be reminded again that total illiquid government debt held by the
National Bank in the 1920s, and presented in Table 4.15, is understated because the data are
not complete. This means that the ratio between bilateral public debt and credits to the
economy presented in Table 4.17 was to some extent higher in the 1920s. However, if the
data in Table 4.15 were complete, the picture conveyed by Table 4.17 and Figure 4.7 would
not have been very different. After 1928, as Table 4.17 demonstrates, illiquid government
debt held by the National Bank was minute if it is compared with credits to the economy
indicating the radical central banking reform that had taken place with the establishment of
the Bank of Greece and the transformation of the National Bank into a purely commercial
bank.
The National Bank restrained credits to the economy after the outbreak of the First
World War, as Tables A2.3 and A2.4 in Appendix A2 show. In 1927, credits to the economy
at constant prices were half of those provided in 1911. On the other hand, bilateral
government debt held by the National Bank, as has been said before, was approximately 3.50
times higher than that appearing on its balance sheet in 1911. This noticeable change in the
balance sheet of the National Bank was not the result of a deliberate shift in the approach of
the National Bank. Nor does it indicate that the bank of issue aimed at curbing its commercial
activities and giving up lucrative private business to evolve itself into a fully fledged central
bank. In 1927, on the eve of central banking reforms, the National Bank remained a dual
purpose bank, that is to say a commercial bank which at the same time acted as the central
bank in Greece. Both commercial activities and central banking responsibilities were
important to the National Bank as late as 1927 when the League of Nations was approached
for assistance. In fact, its governors pursued the stabilisation of the drachma expecting that a
stable drachma would encourage capital flows, which in turn would enable them to expand
the commercial aspect of the National Bank whilst retaining their public responsibilities.

5.1. Introduction
After the end of the Balkan Wars there was optimism in Greece. New fertile areas had been
annexed, the drachma remained at par and the creditworthiness of the Greek government was
high on capital markets abroad. (See Figures 6.3 and 6.5 in Chapter 6 of this thesis.) Hence, at
the time it was difficult to imagine that the country would soon enter a long period of war,
great financial and monetary instability in addition to financial isolation.
Although the Greek government borrowed heavily during the Balkan Wars its
financial position remained fairly strong. The expenditure incurred during the period of
mobilisation was covered by part of the proceeds of the 1910 Bonds Loan and loans from the
National Bank of Greece.272 The loans granted by the bank of issue to the government were
known as ‘credit operations’.273 The government intended to float an international loan after
272 For a detailed presentation of the way that the Balkan Wars were financed, see for example Andreades (1939, pp. 580–589).

196


the end of the Balkan Wars with the aim of paying off the ‘credit operations’ and to develop
the New Areas annexed. This resulted in the flotation of the 1914 Loan.274
At the end of 1913, public debt was 141.99 per cent of GDP. It was also the
equivalent of 252.39 drachmae per capita. In 1913, the drachma remained stable at its LMU
parity where one nominal drachma was equal to one gold drachma, which in turn equalled one
French franc. Therefore, in 1913 per capita public debt was 252.39 gold drachmae or French
francs or indeed 10.10 pounds sterling. These data from 1913 show an overall improvement in
the burden of public debt since the enactment of the Law of Control, despite new external
borrowing after 1900 and domestic loans during the Balkan Wars. By contrast, in 1898 total
Greek public debt including the 2.50 per cent Guaranteed Loan was approximately 230 per
cent of GDP. It was nearly 360 French francs per capita or approximately 14.50 pounds
sterling per capita. (See Table A6.1 in Appendix A6 which presents some general information
on public debt.) The improvement to be seen in the burden of public debt in 1913 was due to a
large extent to the appreciation of the drachma, which by the end of 1909 had reached its
LMU parity. In addition, an increase in GDP and of course in the population in the country
had contributed to this improvement in the level of public debt.
Table A6.1 in Appendix A6 demonstrates that in 1898, after the reconstruction of
Greek public debt, nearly 87 per cent of the country’s total debt was external debt
denominated in gold and traded on secondary markets, whilst only 13 per cent was domestic
debt. By 1913, the share of domestic public debt had increased mainly because of the way in
which war expenditure during the Balkan Wars had been financed: by then 32 per cent of the
total public debt was domestic debt, whilst the share of external debt had decreased to
approximately 68 per cent.
This chapter examines firstly the methods employed by Greek governments to
finance war and reconstruction between the outbreak of the Great War and stabilisation. More
precisely, the methods used to mobilise internal resources are presented. In addition, the
struggle of the Greek government to secure finance from its Allies during the Great War and
then from the international capital markets is discussed. Secondly, this chapter establishes that
market participants in London were well informed about developments in Greece and thus
were able to evaluate country risk during a period when a system of formal rating had not
been developed. Research into the newspaper cuttings that the Council of the Corporation of
Foreign Bondholders systematically collected provides ample evidence that British investors

197


were able to be well informed about developments in Greece and promptly. Finally, this
chapter closes with an appraisal of the period in question and its legacy.
War, and to a large extent subsequent reconstruction, have a long-term impact on
financial institutions. This long-term impact of war and its aftermath on financial institutions
is a result of the need for direct and indirect funding of the conflict and its preparation as well
as of the expenditure that occurs during reconstruction. Central banks tend to come very close
to their governments and support them to pay for war and its aftermath. Deficit financing
becomes an acceptable central bank duty. By contrast, during stabilisation the dangers
inherent in political interference in central banking are widely acknowledged and establishing
central bank independence becomes a major objective.
In the Greek example, a long period of war and monetary upheaval in addition to the
influx of over a million of refugees from Asia Minor put severe pressure on public finance.
The Greek government adopted policies of deficit finance which had as a consequence a close
relationship with the National Bank. During the attempt at stabilising the drachma under the
aegis of the League of Nations in the late 1920s, the question of the relationship of the Greek
government to the National Bank was scrutinised and was one of the reasons that led to the
establishment of a new central bank which would be independent of any political interference.
5.2. Governments in search of finance: the First World War
The First World War created a deep national schism and intense domestic strife in Greece
with the country divided between two sides. The Premier, Venizelos, aspired to a policy of
intervention on the side of the Allies, whilst on the other hand the King was in favour of the
country remaining neutral. The Premier believed in the final victory of the Entente which
would bring territorial gains to Greece whilst the King had faith in the military supremacy of
Germany. This crisis came to a head in 1916. Finally, in June 1917, King Constantine was
forced to leave the country and subsequently the Venizelos government declared war on the
Central Powers.
The Greek government borrowed heavily both before and during active participation
in the First World War. As with most of the belligerent European governments at the time, it
resorted to the printing press to finance expenditure. The increase in the money supply during
the Great War is not usually thought to have been inflationary as these banknotes were issued
under the ΓΧΜΒ Law. The principles upon which the ΓΧΜΒ Law operated were, however,
198


infringed. Short- and long-term loans were also issued.275 Furthermore, in 1918 the Greek
government started issuing the treasury bills known as National Defence Bonds (NDBs).
Finally, the government borrowed for importation of food, sulphur and copper sulphate. As is
discussed in Chapter 4, the National Bank was responsible for financing the importation of
these goods. Overall, Greece financed war expenditure by mobilising internal resources.
During the Great War the National Bank resorted to the ΓΧΜΒ Law repeatedly to
increase the money supply. As has been stated, however, the principles of the 1910 Law were
violated. Between 1916 and 1919 the banknotes issued under the ΓΧΜΒ Law were printed on
the strength of Book Credits opened by foreign governments. In the end, the banknotes issued
under the ΓΧΜΒ Law during the Great War became government debt in forced circulation.
Table 5.1 below shows the Book Credits opened in favour of the Greek government
by other European governments during the period of neutrality. See also Table 4.5 in Chapter
4 which presents the evolution of the ΓΧΜΒ Law between 1916 and 1919 when this law was
used to print banknotes for the last time. Evidence, although scant, located in the archives of
the National Bank, indicates that the Bank was aware of the perils of increasing the money
supply on the strength of Book Credits.276

Eleftherios Venizelos realised that the Allies would not make any real transfers to financially
support the active participation of Greece in the Great War. For this reason he pursued a
different kind of agreement with the Allies that would allow him to finance participation in
the war. Under the February 1918 Paris Agreement, Britain, France and the USA made
available Book Credits in equal shares to the Greek government totalling 750 million French
francs, including a provisional Book Credit of 50 million drachmae opened in 1917.277 The
ΓΧΜΒ Law was modified and on the strength of these Book Credits, the National Bank printed
banknotes that enabled the government to meet the expenses of the armed forces during 1918.278
The Allied Book Credits opened on behalf of Greece could be drawn upon by the Greek
government six months after the conclusion of peace. It was, however, stipulated that the Greek
government reserved the right to draw drafts in case their foreign reserves together with the
National Bank’s deposits available abroad, fell below 100 million francs. The repayment of
these advances placed an obligation on the Greek government and they were granted by the

Allies in pounds sterling, French francs and US dollars. These Book Credits were aimed at
helping the Greek government to procure internal resources, to liquidate arrears and pay for
military arrangements.
This 1918 Paris Agreement between the Greek government and its Allies consisted of
five articles and is presented in Appendix A6. It provided that the amortisation period of the
loan could be up to 15 years. The interest rate of these advances was not specified and the Greek
government was not required to assign any specific revenues as guarantees. Article four of the
Paris Agreement, however, stipulated that until the repayment of these obligations by the Greek
government, no new security could be ‘effected to an external loan without the consent of the
Governments of the USA, France and Great Britain’.279 This clause complicated the relationship
of the Greek government with its war Allies in the 1920s; each time that the Greek government
attempted to float a foreign loan it was under the obligation to ask the permission of its former
Allies.280 An Inter-Allied Financial Commission which was composed of representatives of the
three Allies and of Greece was established in Athens. This Inter-Allied Financial Commission
was made responsible for the authorisation of advances concerning the organisation and
maintenance of the army and navy.
In May 1919, a supplementary agreement was signed and a further 100 million
French francs of Book Credits were granted to Greece; however, this time only by France and
Great Britain but under the same terms and conditions as those of the 1918 agreement.
As Table 5.2 demonstrates, in total the 1918 and 1919 agreements provided for the
opening of Book Credits of 850 million francs and the equivalent of banknotes were printed
by the bank of issue. Zolotas (1928, p. 57) claimed that the National Bank did not always
print fresh banknotes but sometimes used its own reserves to lend the government on the
strength of the Book Credit agreements. Together these two agreements represented a huge
borrowing operation for the Greek government; total Book Credits issued during these two
years were 22.50 per cent of the 1919 GDP.
279 See Appendix A6 for the text of the 1918 Book Credits Agreement between Greece and the Allies.
280 This right was waived in 1927 and 1928 when Greece settled its war debt with Britain and the USA respectively.

In 1918 and 1919 the National Bank made separate agreements with Great Britain and France
on the lines of the Paris Agreement for the financial support of their troops stationed in
Macedonia. These additional agreements stipulated that the interest rate charged on the
advances furnished to the Allied armies in Macedonia would be 5 per cent.
Table 5.4 below shows the advances made by the National Bank to the Allied troops
in Macedonia and the sums that each government reimbursed. The British Treasury
reimbursed nearly all the advances made to the British troops by the National Bank. By
contrast, France did not reimburse any of the advances made to its army in Macedonia.

Just a few months after the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres, in November 1920 Venizelos was
overwhelmingly defeated in a general election.281 This general election that brought the
Populist Party to power together with the unexpected death of the young King Alexander who
had succeeded his father, paved the way for the return to Athens of the exiled King Constantine.
Following a referendum held on 22 November (Julian)/5 December (Gregorian) 1920, King
Constantine was officially returned to the Greek throne. Immediately, the Allied governments
informed Athens that the repatriation of King Constantine meant that they were no longer bound
by the Treaty of Sèvres. Greece would also encounter a financial embargo and cancellation of
the Book Credits.282
Political historiography and military sources correlate subsequent events in Asia Minor
with the return of King Constantine to the Greek throne. Careful examination, however, of
geopolitical developments in the area late in 1920 does not support the view that the outcome of
the election had a catalytic effect on the course of history.283 Economic history literature on the
period links the cancellation of the Book Credits with the depreciation of the drachma and the
difficulties the country faced in raising capital from financial markets abroad in the 1920s.284
With hindsight, the return of the exiled King to Athens, served as an excuse on the part of the
Allies to cancel the Book Credits at a time when their domestic preoccupations prevailed over
international agreements.

Table 5.5 shows the Book Credits that had been realised by the three war Allies
before their cancellation in December 1920. The remaining Book Credits that had not been
realised continued to appear on the balance sheet of the National Bank as ‘reserves abroad
because of the ΓΧΜΒ Law’ until the central banking reform of 1928. These ‘reserves abroad
because of the ΓΧΜΒ Law’ were in fact government debt in forced circulation. Nevertheless,
as is explained in Chapter 4, the persistent inclusion of this entry on the balance sheet of the
National Bank until the banking reform encapsulates vividly the expectations of successive
Greek governments as well as the governors of the National Bank that eventually the Book
Credits would be realised. In the end, one-third of the Stabilisation Loan of 1928, which was
the equivalent of the government debt in forced circulation because of the Allied Book
Credits, was used by the government to repay debt in forced circulation that the newly
established Bank of Greece inherited from its predecessor. This was to strengthen the reserve
position of the new central bank to enable it to support a drachma de jure stabilised.
It has been repeatedly argued that had the Allied Book Credits been realised in full
then the monetary upheaval experienced in the 1920s would have been avoided. The main
argument proposed in favour of this claim is that if the Book Credits had been realised in full,
then the banknotes issued under the Paris Agreements would have been withdrawn from
circulation. This belief was based on article eight of the ΓΧΜΒ Law, which stipulated that
when the bank of issue sold gold or foreign exchange accumulated under this law then it had
to withdraw from circulation the equivalent value in banknotes. The conjuncture, however, of
the early 1920s was very different from that of the period between 1910 and 1914 when the
ΓΧΜΒ Law operated in the way that it was designed to by its ‘father’ Ioannis Valaorites. In
addition, it is believed that the Greek government would not have experienced financial
204


difficulties, in particular during the Asia Minor campaign. As a result the country would have
escaped monetary upheaval in the 1920s.285
During the Great War the drachma remained stable at its par value, whilst at the same
time prices increased more than threefold. The size of Book Credits issued during the entire
First World War was one of the main reasons of the high inflation experienced after the
outbreak of the war and of the monetary upheaval in the 1920s; a fact that was persistently
denied by contemporaneous policy makers and in particular by the governor of the National
Bank, Alexandros Diomides.286 (See Table 6.1 in Chapter 6 for the inflation rates experienced
and Table 5.13 in this chapter for the seigniorage collected by the government during the
period in question.)
5.3. Governments in despair
5.3.1. Introduction
After the cancellation of the Book Credits in December 1920, the Greek government
struggled to finance the Asia Minor campaign, the rehabilitation of over a million of refugees
and reconstruction. In the 1920s, the creditworthiness of the Greek government on the
London market was low and the risk premium rocketed to nearly 19 per cent, reflecting the
political, economic and financial distress that prevailed in Athens. In addition, clause four of
the Paris Agreement and war debts together created a complex financial relationship between
Greece and its former Allies.
The creditworthiness of the Greek government on the London market between 1896
and 1929 is illustrated in Figure 6.3 in Chapter 6. Greek sovereign risk is measured by a
Greek government loan’s spread in London relative to the British consols. The time series of
sovereign risk constructed and presented in Figure 6.3 demonstrate that sovereign risk
remained low during the First World War. The risk premium increased rapidly after 1919
reflecting the decreased credibility of the Greek government as a borrower on the London
market. The Asia Minor campaign, acting perhaps as a proxy of fiscal performance, prompted
a continuous increase in the risk premium of Greek government debt. Military defeat and its
aftermath exerted a strongly negative impact on the value of Greek sovereign debt traded on
the London market and consequently the Greek default risk soared. By the end of the period
in question, Greek country risk had decreased considerably but still remained higher than it

had been at the beginning of 1914. Stabilisation and the concomitant institutional reforms
were gradually factored into the market price of Greek sovereign debt traded in London and
as a result the risk premium demanded by investors fell steadily.287
In the 1920s, the Greek government borrowed from the domestic market to an
unprecedented extent: it heavily borrowed from the National Bank, resorted to forced loans
and issued treasury bills, the so-called National Defence Bonds. In addition and despite the
low creditworthiness of the Greek government on the financial markets abroad, foreign loans
were contracted for productive purposes, the settlement of refugees and the stabilisation of the
drachma. It has to be said, however, that borrowing for the settlement of over a million of
refugees and the stabilisation of the drachma was under the auspices of the Financial
Committee of the League of Nations.
5.3.2. Internal borrowing
In April 1920, a public loan denominated in drachmae, the 5 per cent Lottery Loan, was floated
in Athens with great difficulty, in spite of concessions from the government to encourage
subscription.288 This was the last attempt by the Greek government to issue a public loan on the
Athens market before the stabilisation of the drachma. Subsequently, it heavily borrowed from
the bank of issue, implemented forced loans and issued NDBs.
5.3.2.1. Borrowing from the bank of issue
As is discussed extensively in Chapter 4, the government borrowed widely from the National
Bank in the 1920s. The bank of issue proved to be the main source of financial support for the
government and a complex relationship was created between them. It is unfortunate that there
are no data systematically presented on bilateral government debt held by the bank of issue
before the enactment of the Law of Control that could be compared with the time series
constructed in this thesis. Nevertheless, it is possible that it was the first time in its entire
history as a bank of issue that the National Bank lent to the government to such a great extent.
This, however, remains to be verified by future research.
The money supply was increased again and again for the account of the government
until 1923. As it has been extensively discussed in the previous chapter the printing press was
used once in 1920 and once in 1921, twice during 1922 and then once more in early 1923. In
287 For a detailed quantitative analysis of Greek government sovereign risk between 1914 and 1929, see Christodoulaki et al. (2011, 2012).

206


all cases, the government was charged commission of 0.50 per cent but no interest was levied
and the amortisation period was not specified. All the laws, however, that authorised the use
of the printing press for the account of the government, stated that convertibility could be
restored only if the government had repaid these loans to the bank of issue. In addition, the
National Bank supplied loans to the government using its own reserves and granted advances
that allowed the Ministry of Finance to receive day-to-day credit from the bank of issue.
Between 1918 and 1925, NDBs became an important source of finance for the
government. In particular, after 1923, once the printing press stopped being used as a
financial tool, the government heavily depended on NDBs to finance public expenditure. The
central bank played an instrumental role in the success of these treasury bills. (NDBs are
examined in detail in part 5.3.2.3 of this section of Chapter 5.)
The use of the printing press, bilateral loans and advances from the central bank are
all conventional measures that governments take to finance their budget deficits. During the
period in question the National Bank was further involved in supporting the government
financially; for example it was on behalf of the government that it financed the importation of
food during the Great War and the Asia Minor campaign. In addition, the government
borrowed from the National Bank for the indemnification of urban refugees for their property
left behind in Asia Minor.
5.3.2.2. The two Forced Loans
On Monday 21 March 1922 (Julian calendar), the minister of finance, Petros Protopapadakis,
delivered the budget to the parliament for the fiscal year that was nearing its end. (At the time
the fiscal year ran from 1 April to 31 March.) In his speech, he painted a bleak picture of the
financial position of the government. The estimated total budget deficit amounted to 1,679
million drachmae. For military expenditure alone the government needed 1,710 million
drachmae at a time that the Greek army was marching into the interior of Asia Minor.
Subsequently, he spoke about the unsuccessful attempts of the Greek government to secure
capital from abroad and warned of the perils of monetising the budget deficit using as an
example the monetary situation which prevailed in Austria and Germany at the time. Then,
the minister of finance, in his budget speech, made an appeal for a domestic loan of
approximately 1.5 billion drachmae to cover the budget deficit as it then stood, stressing as he
did so that it was a matter of urgency.289

207


Petros Protopapadakis suggested increasing the money supply by 550 million
drachmae adding that subsequently the total banknotes in circulation would be approximately
3 billion drachmae.290 Then, he proposed a controversial plan to fund government expenditure
by literally forcing the Greek people to lend the government half of their cash holdings.291 This
proposal for an internal loan by the minister of finance became the 2749 law on 25 March 1922
(Julian calendar) and is known as the First Forced Loan. In short, this law stipulated that all
banknotes of 5, 10, 25, 500, and 1 thousand drachmae were required to be presented at the
nearest bank where they were to be cut into two parts. The part of each banknote that had the
effigy of Georgios Stavros, the first governor of the National Bank and one of its founders,
constituted legal tender for half its original value. The other half that bore the picture of a crown
or ‘Στέμμα’ was exchanged for a twenty-year bond at 6.50 per cent. In this way temporarily the
government’s cash requirements were met.
The expected revenue from this forced loan was 1,570 million drachmae. In the end
the final proceeds were 1,288,470,545. The First Forced Loan was extended beyond the Greek
borders and banknotes of Greek drachmae held abroad were subject to the cutting process. On
the other hand, foreigners in Greece were exempted from having their cash holdings cut into
two parts with the part of ‘Georgios Stavros’ remaining legal tender and the other half a twenty
year government bond.
There is a consensus in the literature that the impact of the Forced Loan of 1922 was
deflationary. The only exception is Kostis (2003, p. 156), who rejects the idea that the
unexpected and sharp reduction in the banknotes in circulation in March 1922 had a
deflationary impact. To support his claim, he resorts to the increase in the price level during
that year: inflation may have been as high as 55 per cent in 1922 when the previous year it
had fluctuated between 17 and 25 per cent, depending on the price index used to estimate
inflation. However, a counterfactual question should be asked to understand the impact of the
First Forced Loan. What would have happened had the government employed the printing
press to monetise the entire budget deficit in March 1922?
sittings, March 1922, pp. 1198–1288, where the debate that took place in the parliament regarding the First Forced Loan is recorded.
290 More precisely, the upper limit of the banknotes that could be in circulation according to all legal arrangements amounted to 3,100,140,000, including a 550 billion increase in the money supply that the minister of finance proposed. (See Table 4.4 in Chapter 4 and Table A3.1 in Appendix 3.)
291 A similar forced loan was introduced in Finland at the end of 1945, although its objective was different from the Greek Forced Loan of 1922. Its aim was to ‘stop rampant inflation ... by decreasing the note circulation’. For more, see Bank of Finland (1947, p. 19).
208


The impact of the First Forced Loan was deflationary as the money supply was
abruptly and without advanced warning decreased, if only temporarily, in 1922. Figure 5.1
illustrates this sharp decrease in the value of banknotes in circulation in March 1922. At the
end of February 1922, the value of banknotes in circulation was of approximately 2,218
million drachmae. By the end of the following month, the banknotes that were in circulation
amounted to 1,198 million drachmae, as Table A3.1 in Appendix A3 shows. The currency
that had been withdrawn soon returned, however, back into circulation as the government
spent it to meet its own requirements. In addition, the Forced Loan had as a consequence a
decrease in purchasing power and an increase in demand for bank credit. ‘Στέμμα’, that is to
say the part of a banknote that constituted a 6.50 per cent government bond could be used as
collateral for advances from the National Bank.292 Consequently, the banknotes in circulation
rapidly increased and as Figure 5.1 indicates, by the end of September 1922 their value was
similar to that when the Forced Loan was instigated. By the end of that year the money supply
had increased by 40 per cent.

In January 1926, the experiment of the First Forced Loan was repeated as another forced loan
was imposed by the government of General Theodore Pangalos. This time, however, it was
more limited in its application. The 1926 law demanded the redemption of one quarter part of
those banknotes in circulation that were of a 50 drachmae denomination or upwards. The
interest rate of the Second Forced Loan was 6 per cent and the revenue from it amounted to
1,250 million drachmae. Its amortisation period was 20 years and this time it was contained
within the geographical limits of the country.
Figure 5.2: Second Forced Loan of 1926 (December 1925=100) Source: Author’s calculations using the data of Table A3.1 in Appendix A3.
The Second Forced Loan was aimed at providing a definite settlement of the outstanding
NDBs. Half of the proceeds of this forced loan were used by the government to repay its debt
to the National Bank resulting from NDBs. The remainder of the proceeds of this loan were
used to pay off half of the outstanding NDBs in cash. The other half of the NDBs were
converted into 8 per cent bonds with a ten-year amortisation period.
Figure 5.2 demonstrates the impact of the Second Forced Loan on the money supply.
In January 1926, the banknotes in circulation decreased unexpectedly by approximately 21
per cent. By the end of the year, the currency that had been withdrawn had not yet returned
back into circulation. Figure 5.2 further demonstrates that by the end of December 1926 the
total amount of the banknotes in circulation still remained at a lower level than before the
implementation of the Second Forced Loan. The Second Forced Loan, together with the

settlement of the NDBs in early 1926, was the first major step and perhaps one of the most
important towards de facto stabilisation of the drachma in 1927.
5.3.2.3. National Defence Bonds
The Law of Control restricted the number of treasury bills that the Greek government could
issue to 10 million drachmae which was approximately one-tenth of their ordinary revenue
between 1892 and 1896.293 This limit was reached in November 1912 and as the ordinary
revenue of the Greek government had increased by then, the amount of treasury bills that
could be issued was also raised to 25 million drachmae with the consent of the IFC.294
In 1918, the government introduced by law a new series of treasury bills (National
Defence Bonds) in maturities of three, six and ten months up to the value of 200 million
drachmae.295 The issuing of this series of NDBs echoed the so called Bons de la Défence
Nationale issued in France at the time. The National Bank was made responsible for discounting
the NDBs. According to this initial law, NDBs could be discounted at the National Bank after
the passage of half of the period of their maturity.296
After 1920, the limit of the number of NDBs that could be issued was increased
repeatedly becoming 600 million drachmae in June 1923. In December 1923, 1,250 million
drachmae of NDBs could be issued and by the end of August 1924 the value of the NDBs that
could potentially be issued stood at 2,250 million drachmae.297 This amount of 2,250 million
drachmae of NDBs, a short-dated investment, corresponded to approximately 45 per cent of
ordinary revenue for the fiscal year 1924–25.
The issuance of these treasury bills also directly involved the National Bank, which
not only marketed the bills for the treasury but guaranteed their repayment, as well as
standing by to discount them if the holder desired cash before maturity. Under a law passed in
December 1922, the National Bank was given the right to issue banknotes on its own behalf
beyond the legal limit, in case the government was unable to pay its debt to the Bank because
of NDBs. This law provided that as soon as the government paid back outstanding debt
related to NDBs, the Bank had to withdraw from circulation the equivalent amount in

government had to pay 3 per cent of its debt to the Bank because of NDBs at the end of each
year.298 As it has already been mentioned by the end of the institution of NDBs the National
Bank had never availed itself of this right.

Table 5.6 shows the interest rate that the NDBs of various maturities bore. In addition, it
indicates changes in the interest rate and the evolution of the institution. Initially, NDBs of
three-month, six-month and one-year maturity were issued. In April 1924, NDBs of five-year
maturity were introduced for the first time and a year later NDBs of three- and ten-year
maturity were added, whilst issue of the three-month NDBs was stopped. The response from
the public, however, to NDBs with a medium- and long-term maturity was limited. By the end
of 1924, only 0.60 per cent of the total bonds issued had a five-year maturity.299 By then, the
popularity of the whole institution had begun to ebb away.

Tables 5.7 and 5.8 trace the evolution of NDBs. Data in Table 5.7 cover the period between
1918 and 1922 and from 1926 to 1928. They are biannual data. By contrast, the data in Table
5.8 show the outstanding balance at the end of each month between 1923 and 1925. Figure

Both Table 5.8 and Figure 5.3 demonstrate that by the end of 1923 the value of the
outstanding NDBs had increased significantly. The peak was reached on 23 June 1924 when
there were outstanding NDBs of 1,933.207 million drachmae.300 This was the equivalent of
nearly 40 per cent of the ordinary revenue of the government for the fiscal year 1924–25.
Subsequently, a decrease is seen.
NDBs were a short-term, profitable and highly liquid investment. In particular after
December 1923, NDBs of three-, six- and twelve-month maturity could be discounted at the
National Bank one day after their issuance.301 This stipulation increased their popularity as it
made them relatively easy to sell. It was also a favourite investment medium for banks.302 For
reference, on 31 December 1924 approximately 27 per cent of the outstanding NDBs were
held by banks.303

The institution of NDBs reached its peak in June 1924. Subsequently, there was a decrease in
the outstanding balance of NDBs as Table 5.8 and Figure 5.3 demonstrate. By the end of July
1924, NDBs started not to be renewed and instead the National Bank had to pay them off. By
the end of December 1924 the government owed to the National Bank approximately 300
million drachmae because of NDBs that had not been rolled over.304
The smooth functioning of the institution came close to ending in the first five months
of 1925 when a large number of NDBs were brought to the National Bank for discounting.
This culminated on 30 April 1925 when on a single day, NDBs of nearly 111 million
drachmae were discounted by the National Bank. To cope with this situation the government
introduced restrictive measures which limited the discounting of NDBs by the National Bank
in the second half of 1925.305
In 1925, the policy of the banks changed; they invested only a very limited proportion
of their liquid assets in NDBs.306 Money became tight. The discount rate increased twice during
that year; once in February and then again in August when it increased from 8.50 to 10 per cent.
(See Table 3.12 in Chapter 3.)
At the end of December 1925, the government owed the National Bank 612 million
drachmae because of NDBs that had been redeemed by then. (See Table 4.15 in Chapter 4.)
This item of government debt to the National Bank can be compared with credits to the
agricultural sector: in December 1925, agricultural credit represented 92 per cent of the
government’s outstanding debt to the National Bank because of NDBs. The government
needed 12 per cent of its ordinary revenue in the fiscal year that had ended in March 1925
simply to repay this item of its floating debt to the National Bank. Furthermore, on 31
December 1925, 93.85 per cent of the outstanding NDBs were short-term bills with an
amortisation period up to a year.
After the middle of 1924, the National Bank was under severe strain because of
NDBs that it had either to discount or to redeem. In February 1925, the governor of the
National Bank proposed increasing the banknotes in circulation by 600 million drachmae for
‘the needs of trade’.307 It is probable that Diomides was eager to print banknotes in 1925 to
cope with the increasing pressure that the Bank was experiencing because of the NDBs. The
British representative on the IFC, L. G. Roussin, objected to this proposed new increase in the
304 Annual Report of the National Bank for 1924 (1925, p. xvii).

number of banknotes in circulation and effectively blocked it. Ultimately, the printing press
was not used and instead the governors of the National Bank suggested to the government the
implementation of the Second Forced Loan to deal directly with the floating debt caused by
NDBs.
The Second Forced Loan, introduced in January 1926, aimed at settling the question
of the NDBs. Half of its yield, which amounted to 1,250 million drachmae, was used for the
repayment of the government debt to the National Bank caused by NDBs.
By April 1926, the NDBs due for repayment amounted to approximately 1,272
million drachmae, as roughly 93 per cent of the outstanding NDBs had a period of maturity of
less than a year. As is explained above, half of the outstanding short-term NDBs were repaid
in cash by the government when they reached maturity using the remaining proceeds of the
Second Forced Loan whilst the other half was converted into a loan repayable in ten years and
bearing interest at 8 per cent. This loan is known as the Third Forced Loan.
Thus, with the nip of scissors a significant source of the monetary instability of the
1920s was removed. The NDBs were a major cause of inflation and at the same time an
important source of revenue for the government. In particular after 1923, when the printing
press stopped rolling, NDBs became the main instrument by which to finance budget deficits.
The NDBs were rarely used as means of payment, however, as has been explained before it was
easy to discount them at the National Bank.308
The question which is raised here is whether the funding crisis of 1925 was caused by a
sudden crisis of confidence in the public finance practices of the government or simply that
bondholders of NDBs, and in particular banks had found more lucrative means of investment.309
The latter view was supported by the governor of the National Bank in his annual report for
1925. Diomides argued that the redemptions came primarily from commercial banks who
wished to make loans to the then booming Greek economy.310 The National Bank changed its
discount rate twice in 1925. The money market was becoming tighter and an increase in the
discount rate of the National Bank further stepped up interest rates in the economy. Banks
preferred, since the profit was higher, to lend rather than to invest in short-term treasury bills. It
is difficult, however, to single out one of the reasons mentioned above to explain why it

became increasingly difficult for the government to refinance its floating debt of NDBs after
the middle of 1924.
5.3.3. External borrowing
All Greek governments faced great difficulties in borrowing from the international capital
markets in the 1920s. The literature relates these difficulties to the embargo imposed by the
war Allies. In the 1920s, however, the London market ‘was not the free market of the pre-war
days’.311 More importantly, at the time the creditworthiness of the Greek government on the
London market was very low, as Figure 6.3 in Chapter 6 demonstrates. In fact, in the early
1920s, Greek government bonds plummeted and as a consequence market rates rocketed,
reflecting the political, economic and financial distress that prevailed in Athens during that
period. This occurred at a time when the country was having to absorb over a million of
refugees that had crossed the Aegean Sea from Asia Minor.
In February 1923, Greece approached the Council of the League of Nations hoping to
float an international loan under its aegis for the settlement of refugees. The negotiations with
the League were protracted and the Geneva Protocol was only signed in September 1923.312
For this purpose, an autonomous organisation was established, namely the Refugee
Settlement Commission. This Commission handled the proceeds of the First Refugee Loan
and was made responsible for the settlement of refugees primarily in rural areas.313
The 7 per cent Refugee Loan of 1924 was the only loan to be floated on the
international financial markets before the stabilisation of the drachma. This was made possible
because it was issued under the auspices of the League of Nations and its yield was used for the
rehabilitation of refugees. The total sum issued was £12,300,000. The price at issue was 88 per
cent in London and New York and 86 per cent in Athens.314 A substantial part of the loan, in
other words £7,500,000, was issued in London. The rest was floated in almost equal parts in
Athens and New York. The Refugee Loan was placed under the direct control of the IFC.

Note: The 1923 Canadian Loan was not a new loan but the rescheduling of an agreement between the Greek government and the Canadian government which took place in 1919. This loan from the Canadian government provided for the payment of wheat imports.
Contrary to conventional belief and in spite of the war debt embargo on foreign
financial markets, there was some capital influx into Greece after 1924. This influx was possible
because the embargo was applied against the central government and excluded public entities.
The Greek government could and did raise capital from smaller capital markets and for
infrastructure programmes that were being undertaken at the time. However, raising money
from the small capital markets of Europe, such as with the Swedish Loan of 1926, proved to be
very expensive and the sums that could be raised were very limited. Table 5.9 lists all the
external loans that were contracted before the implementation of the stabilisation programme
in 1928.
The so-called Swedish Loan, a private loan, was obtained from the match trust Svenska
Tandsticksaktielboget, which had raised loans for other European and Latin American countries
in the 1920s. The nominal value of this loan was 1 million pounds sterling; its issue price was
94 per cent, the nominal interest rate was 8.5 per cent and the redemption period 28 years. The
real interest rate was a fraction above 9 per cent. This was at a time when the market yield of
pre-1914 Greek loans on the London market was between 8.30 and 8.80 whilst that of the
Refugee Loan of 1924 was around 7.60 per cent. The government also conceded to the Alsing
Trading Company the exclusive right to sell matches in Greece for 28 years. This was a high
price indeed to pay for such limited capital, which was used by the government of General
Pangalos to cover just one-third of the budget deficit for that financial year.

5.4. Developments in Greece: The Fleet Street Perspective315
A considerable part of this thesis is devoted to Athens’ foreign borrowing and the complicated
relationship that arose between Greek political and monetary authorities on the one hand and
foreign supervisors and financial markets on the other. During the entire period in question
the creditworthiness of the Greek government on the London market fluctuated markedly
depending on a variety of historical events including political and institutional changes.
Research into the press of the period will ascertain how well informed market
participants in London were about developments in Greece, so as to be able to evaluate
country risk at a time that sovereign credit rating was not common practice. Having said that,
Moody’s Manual of Investments, which at the time furnished investors with ‘a key to the
relative security and stability of particular investment bonds’, valued the Refugee Loan as a
safer investment than other Greek loans traded on the London Stock Exchange. Under their
system of ratings, the Refugee Loan carried a ‘Baa’ rating whilst, for example, the Monopoly
Loan one of the Old Loans placed under the jurisdiction of the IFC, the 1910 Bonds Loan and
the 1914 Loan all carried a ‘Ba’ rating.316
The Council of the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders, besides publishing an annual
report, systematically collected invaluable information from the British press on countries at
the centre of their interest. This published material, sourced from a wide range of mainly daily
press, was neatly organised in a continuous format in the form of cutting books.317 The
material on Greece [hereafter Greek Extracts] consists of nine volumes, covering the period
from 1867 until January 1971. Volumes six and seven, loaded with information that appeared
in the British press during the period in question, have been used in this thesis.318
The Greek Extracts provide ample evidence that British investors were able to be
well informed about developments in Greece, and promptly. They also indicate the kind of
qualitative information that an investors’ organisation, whose principal objective was ‘the

317 These volumes, adding up to a total of 503 volumes, are kept at the Guildhall Library, London. The cuttings are almost entirely in English, taken primarily from British daily newspapers, the weeklies and the financial press.

Notes: (1) This table shows the absolute number of press cuttings on Greece, per month and per year, that were gathered in the Greek Extracts. (2) The number of press cuttings gathered for the first six months of the year is generally higher than that of the second half. (3) The total number of cuttings for the first half of 1914 is considerably higher than the average number observed during the first six months of each subsequent year during the period in question. This, to a large extent, is explained by the flotation of the 1914 Loan which attracted a lot of publicity in the press. In addition, the number of press cuttings clustered as ‘National Issues’ in Table 5.11 during the first semester of 1914 is substantial both in comparison with other years and the second part of 1914.

Extracts include during the period under examination. Table 5.11 illustrates the wide range of
issues covered by the press cuttings in the Greek Extracts. At the same time, however, Table
5.11 indicates the kind of news that the Council considered important in evaluating the
creditworthiness of the Greek government.
The system employed to compose this table was to read the Greek Extracts and then
divide the issues tackled in the cuttings into categories. Often, one press cutting refers to more
than one topic related to Greece. For this reason, the total of Table 5.11 is different from the
total of Table 5.10, which is simply the number of press cuttings per year that the volumes
include.

Notes:
(1) The system employed to compose this table was to read the Greek Extracts and then divide the issues tackled in the cuttings into categories. One piece of press cutting may refer to more than one issue related to Greece. For this reason, the total of observations in Table 5.11 is different from the total of Table 5.10 which shows the absolute number of press cuttings per year that the Greek Extracts include. (2) ‘National Issues’ is a generic term that contains news on foreign diplomacy, reports on Greek minorities in the Near East and the Balkans, Greek War debts as well as the issue of Book Credits and rearmament. (3) Cuttings grouped as ‘National Issues’ in 1914 mainly refer to minority issues of Greek populations in surrounding areas not belonging to Greece and to a strained relationship between Greece and Turkey. In 1925, 1926 and 1927 ‘National Issues’ includes news on the negotiations for the settlement of war debts with Great Britain, France and the USA. (4) News in the Greek Extracts on the macroeconomic situation in Greece are divided into the following categories: Economic Conditions where general references on economic progress and development have been classified; information on agriculture and minerals is included in the Primary Sector; Industry, Trade, Shipping as well as Infrastructure, which contains news on infrastructure projects proposed or underway and on railways; Stabilisation, the Exchange Rate, the Money Supply and the National Bank which was the central bank in Greece until 12 May 1928; and finally, the Banks, where references to banks other than the National Bank are included. (5) Information on macroeconomic conditions could be separated into two groups: news on the real economy (Economic Conditions, Primary Sector, Industry, Trade, Shipping and Infrastructure) and monetary and financial information (Stabilisation, the Exchange Rate, the Money Supply, the National Bank and the Banks). (6) The Greek Extracts include press cuttings with information for British investors on entrepreneurial opportunities in Greece. (7) Miscellaneous primarily contains information on foreign direct investment in Greece.

It is apparent that the Council pedantically collected information on Greek government debt
as it appeared in the British press. References to public debt account for between one-third
and over half of the total references to Greece in a year. If information on public debt in the
Greek Extracts is thematically disaggregated, news on the service of the debt predominates.320
Special consideration was also paid to gathering announcements in the press that described
efforts of the Greek government to raise fresh capital both on the international financial
markets and in Athens. In retrospect, reports in the press on fresh borrowing and its terms
might have been instigated frequently by Greek officials in an attempt to influence market
expectations. Ex post, having the benefit of archival research, reports on new loans during
periods that the Greek government faced difficulties in borrowing or a financial embargo, as
the London market was not ‘the free market of the pre-war days’,321 illustrate the method and
the terms on which Greek officials wished to borrow.322

321 Atkin (1970, p. 326).
322 See, for example, Greek Extracts for 1921 and Greek Extracts, F. News, 8 April 1927.


The information presented in Table 5.11 demonstrates that public finance comes after
government debt in terms of importance. References to the finance of the Greek government
vary from 14 per cent to nearly 29 per cent of the total theme references of a year. In the
1920s, it was customary to report the budget presentations of the Greek Minister of Finance in
the British press. In these reports, the tenor was positive and expenditure typically met
revenues. Public borrowing was added up with ordinary revenues to present a budget in
equilibrium, a practice that was not overlooked by newspaper correspondents.323
Citations on politics vary from no reference at all in 1919, a year of political stability,
to 12.50 per cent of total citations in 1924 which was a year of constitutional change as the
country became a republic, and had only short-lived governments. The collection of press
cuttings in the Greek Extracts on the political situation is eclectic and hardly paints the picture
of political crisis and bitter polarisation that characterised these times. Having said this,
however, one can find press cuttings on all major political changes and general elections of
the period.
War and refugee problems have serious implications for government indebtedness. It
is therefore surprising that both these issues, as Table 5.11 demonstrates, are hardly covered
by the press cuttings collected in the Extracts. Cuttings on the Greek presence in Smyrna or
on the advance of the Greek army in Asia Minor and ultimate defeat are scarce in the Greek
Extracts. By contrast, events in Asia Minor and the debacle were more than adequately
reported in the British press.324 In addition, despite the refugee problem in Greece being
‘more acute ... than in any other country’325 and at the time attracting widespread attention,
press cuttings on refugees included in the Greek Extracts are limited and mainly related to the
Refugee Loan of 1924.326
News on macroeconomic conditions in the country can be divided into two parts:
news on the three sectors of the economy and monetary and financial information. In the
1920s, a period of high inflation in Greece, news on monetary conditions dominates.
Information on fluctuations of the drachma is provided and also there are articles that discuss
the root of that problem. Economic and policy changes are reported and there is plenty of
information on the central banking reforms that led to the establishment of a fully fledged
central bank. In total, news on the three sectors of the economy together with monetary and
financial news fluctuates between 6.50 per cent of the total observations in 1918 and over 30

per cent in 1925.327 Both in qualitative and quantitative terms, news on macroeconomic
developments gathered in the Greek Extracts plays a more central role than information on
the political situation, supporting the assertion that ‘economics, not politics, were a key factor
in allocating [...] exports of capital’.328
A secondary objective of the Council of the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders was
to provide information on ‘the economic and financial condition’ of states that were at the
centre of their interest.329 They never attempted to develop a system of formal rating.330
However, they collected ample information to enable investors to assess sovereign risk. The
cuttings from the British press collected in the Greek Extracts indicate that news on public
debt took precedence over any other issue and public finance followed. News on
macroeconomic conditions was also a vital component of the information gathered in the
Greek Extracts.
This qualitative research on cutting books of mainly daily press organised by an
investors’ organisation supports findings of quantitative statistical analysis of Greek sovereign
risk between 1914 and 1929. This statistical analysis of daily time series of country risk
between the outbreak of the Great War and stabilisation shows that investors acted upon news
of fiscal performance and public debt developments. Unforeseen political changes also
influenced market participants’ expectations. By contrast, institutional innovations, such as
the adoption of the gold exchange standard and the establishment of a central bank de novo,
did not result in any quantitative market response. Stabilisation and the concomitant
institutional reforms, however, were gradually factored into the market price of Greek
sovereign debt traded in London and as a result the creditworthiness of the Greek government
steadily improved.331
327 In 1918, all references are on the economy and trade opportunities in Greece for British merchants. In 1925, the emphasis is shifted to the exchange rate and to news on the money supply; nearly 24 per cent of the total references are on monetary and financial issues, whilst only eight per cent refer to the economy.

5.5. The legacy of the period
Figure 5.4 shows the budget surplus, the primary surplus and the exchange rate parity of the
drachma with the pound sterling in historical perspective. The time series cover the period
between 1833 and 1930. This figure demonstrates that budget deficits were a chronic
characteristic of public finances. It should be noted that it also indicates that there was an
attempt to improve the position of the budget after the enactment of the Law of Control. This
attempt, however, was short-lived. After 1907, budget deficits persisted once again and when
the First Balkan War broke out primary deficits also came into the picture.
It has been argued that deficit financing was an instrument of policy and a result of
the adoption of a system of Western parliamentarianism. The main characteristics of the
taxation system in Greece were firstly that the bulk of public revenue came from indirect
taxes, and secondly the way that the fiscal burden was distributed amongst different classes or
interest groups. The peasantry and the higher classes were under-taxed. By contrast, the
middle classes carried the main fiscal burden by not being able to avoid indirect or income
taxation. Thus, both the structure and the evolution of the taxation system in Greece were
based on grounds of political expediency. It was when parliamentary democracy and
universal male suffrage were adopted in 1864 that the under-taxation of the peasantry started.
The peasantry constituted the largest voting group whilst the higher classes were involved in
governance.332 These arguments may not, however, survive if analysis on a micro level is
carried out. The peasantry composed a substantial part of the electorate but at the same time the
majority of them lived close to subsistence levels, in particular during the nineteenth century.
In addition, it has been argued that foreign capital was acquired to serve a political and
not an economic function.333 Foreign capital was not seen by the state as a tool for promoting
economic growth, but rather as a means of enabling the central government to enhance its
position in Greek society.334 The cost of national unification also absorbed a substantial part of
foreign loans.335 This policy of deficit financing, coupled with a concomitant dependence on
foreign borrowing, resulted in Greece experiencing recurring default and/or difficulty in
borrowing independently from the international capital markets. Both default and difficulties
with independent borrowing invited international financial intervention and control which in
332 See Dertilis (1993, pp. 23–70). Kammas and Sarantides (2017) test econometrically Dertilis (1993) hypothesis that is to say that the agrarian sector was undertaxed and that this trend began in the 1860s when fundamental political reforms were implemented.

turn resulted in partial loss of fiscal and monetary sovereignty. Conditionality attached to
supervised foreign borrowing by governments experiencing difficulties in accessing capital
markets independently promoted institutions that had previously been adopted by creditor
countries whilst at the same time guaranteeing the continuity of debt service.

Although the heavy budget deficits experienced in the 1920s were not extraordinary in the
history of public finance from Independence to stabilisation in 1928, the depreciation of the
drachma after 1919 was unique. By 1928, when the drachma was stabilised de jure it had lost
approximately 95 per cent of its value. This scale of monetary instability, as Figure 5.4
demonstrates, had not been experienced before, in spite of long periods of floating exchange
rates.
The depreciation of the drachma in the 1920s was the result of monetisation of budget
deficits. The participation of Greece in the First World War was financed by the Allied Book
Credits and subsequently the printing press was rolled to cover public expenditure during the
Asia Minor campaign. In addition, NDBs became a major financial tool for the government in
particular after the debacle.
Table 5.12 shows seigniorage collected by the government between the outbreak of
the Great War and the establishment of the Bank of Greece. Seigniorage was calculated in a
simple way: as the difference in the average banknotes in circulation between two consecutive
years. This difference is presented in the first column of Table 5.12. The rest of this table
indicates seigniorage as a percentage of public revenue, expenditure and GDP. Table 5.12
demonstrates that seigniorage, in other words loans to the government by the central bank in
forced banknotes, constituted a significant source of revenue for the government during the
period that this table covers. During certain periods it was practically the only source of
extraordinary revenue for the government. In this way, the bank of issue operated at barely
arm’s length from the government.

The burden of public debt in 1928 after de jure stabilisation is shown in Table A6.1 in
Appendix A6. Public debt as a percentage of GDP was approximately 133 per cent in 1928.
This is an improvement if public debt as a percentage of GDP after stabilisation is compared
with that of 1913. Public debt as a percentage of GDP in 1913 was 142 per cent. The picture,
however, changes if public debt per capita is estimated. Table A6.1 indicates that per capita
public debt both in gold drachmae and in pounds sterling nearly doubled between 1913 and
1928, in spite of a considerable increase in the population because of the influx of one and a
quarter million refugees. In 1913, public debt per capita was 252 gold drachmae or 10 pounds
sterling, whilst by 1928 it had increased to 484 gold drachmae or 19 pounds sterling. These
data imply that the burden of public debt per capita in 1928 was even higher than in 1898,
although data of public debt as a percentage of GDP create a different picture.
236


Table A6.1 also demonstrates that the structure of public debt changed between 1898
and 1928. After the enactment of the Law of Control and the consolidation of domestic
government debt in 1898, domestic public debt represented only 13 per cent of the total public
debt. At the end of the Balkan Wars as well as after stabilisation, the percentage share of
domestic government debt had increased to one-third of the total public debt. In 1928, 40 per
cent of the government debt denominated in drachmae was held by the newly established
central bank together with its predecessor.
The way that a long period of war and subsequent reconstruction was financed had a
long-term impact on the banking structure in Greece. The implementation of a stabilisation
plan sponsored by the Financial Committee of the League of Nations urged institutional
reforms which focused on the country’s central banking system. The League insisted on
reform of the National Bank, the issuing bank in Greece at the time, to confine its activities to
central banking and to become independent from the government. This suggestion led to the
establishment of a fully fledged central bank in Greece in 1928. At the same time, the
National Bank chose to retain its commercial activities and maintain its strength as a banking
institution.

6.1. Introduction
With the drachma exhibiting notable stability during the second half of 1924, the First
Refugee Loan was floated under the auspices of the League of Nations in December of that
year. It was then widely believed that Greece was on the threshold of stabilising its
currency.336 The governor of the National Bank of Greece, Alexandros Diomides, assumed
that after the flotation of the 1924 Refugee Loan, the drachma would stabilise at a rate of no
more than 250 drachmae to the pound sterling through the interplay of market forces.337 In
fact, it would take nearly four years and would involve the implementation of a stabilisation
plan sponsored by the Financial Committee of the League of Nations and the flotation of a
second loan on the international markets under the auspices of the League, for Greece to
stabilise de jure its currency.
Tables 6.1 and 6.2, as well as Figure 6.1, illustrate in brief the monetary upheaval in Greece in
the 1920s. Table 6.1 shows the inflation rates experienced in Greece between the outbreak of
the Great War and stabilisation. Two price indices were used: the price index that appears in
the Statistical Yearbooks and that produced by Kostelenos et al. (2007). Both indices indicate

that by the mid-1920s inflation had stabilised although its rate remained high. The significant
fluctuations in prices from year to year demonstrated in Table 6.1 came to an end in 1924.
Nevertheless, inflation remained high until 1927, by which time the drachma was heading
towards stabilisation.

Figure 6.1 demonstrates the way that the value of the drachma fluctuated from May 1919
when it began depreciating to the end of 1928. The data used are weekly data, hand-collected
from The Economist which are available upon request. Table 6.2 provides summary statistics
of the exchange rate during the entire period that the drachma was depreciating. The period in
question was divided into sub-periods taking into account historical and political events.
It is evident that the external value of the drachma fluctuated severely and by the time
convertibility was introduced it had lost approximately 95 per cent of its pre-war value. On 12
May 1928, when the gold exchange standard was adopted, one sterling pound equalled 375
239


drachmae whilst according to the LMU parity one pound sterling was equal to 25.207
drachmae.
De facto stabilisation in Greece was achieved in the spring of 1927 and the
implementation of a stabilisation programme prepared by the Financial Committee of the
League of Nations led to the adoption of the gold exchange standard on 12 May 1928. The
National Bank of Greece, the Greek Treasury, the IFC, the Bank of England and later the
Financial Committee of the League of Nations were all involved in the attempts at stabilisation
of the drachma in the late 1920s.
In this chapter firstly, the measures taken that curbed the depreciation of the drachma
are examined. Secondly, the stabilisation plans proposed by the British member of the IFC and
the sub-governor of the National Bank are presented. Subsequently, the negotiations with the
Financial Committee of the League and the stabilisation programme they prepared are studied.
A comparison of the League stabilisation programmes follows and the flotation of the
Stabilisation Loan is discussed. This chapter closes with an examination of the parallels and
contrasts between the Law of Control of 1898 and the 1928 Geneva Stabilisation Plan. At the
time, the establishment of the Bank of Greece was regarded as a symbol of foreign intervention
in the country’s affairs and its creation was often compared with of the Law of Control.

Notes:
1 ‘The Slide of the Drachma’ covers the period from 9 May 1919 up to 17 May 1928. In May 1919, the drachma began fluctuating after having been stable around its LMU parity since the end of 1909 and on 12 May 1928 the gold exchange standard was de jure adopted. This entire period of monetary upheaval in Greece in the 1920s, entitled here as ‘The Slide of the Drachma’, is divided below into four sub-periods.
2 This first sub-period begins in May 1919, when Greek troops disembarked in Smyrna and ends in November 1920 when the Allies renounced payment of the Book Credits.
242


3 This second sub-period begins in December 1920, when the exiled King Constantine returns to the Greek throne and finishes with the Asia Minor debacle.
4 This third sub-period is a period of severe political upheaval in Athens.
5 This fourth sub-period begins when a coalition government is formed after a general election whose priority was the stabilisation of the Greek currency and finishes with de jure adoption of the gold exchange standard.
6 Late in May 1921 a syndicate of leading banks was formed by the Greek government which was known as the Bank Consortium. The objective of the government in setting up this Consortium was to curb the depreciation of the drachma. Theoretically, all the foreign exchange which entered or left the country, regardless of the reason or the mechanism, was to be controlled and managed by this banking syndicate. Its capital came mainly from contributions made by the participating banks; the size of each contribution at the same time determining the responsibility of the investing bank and its share in the expenses as well as in the profits and losses of the Consortium. The Bank Consortium operated from 1 June/14 July 1921 up to 28 September/11 October 1922. By the end, almost all Greek banks were members of this banking syndicate. During its operation, however, a large proportion of the country’s foreign exchange earnings eluded its control; there are references to a 25 and indeed 35 per cent difference between the price set by the Consortium and that prevailing on the shadow foreign exchange market. For more on the Bank Consortium, see NBGHA_Α1Σ19Υ1Φ2Ε1; NBGHA_Α1Σ19Υ1Φ2Ε21; NBGHA_Α1Σ19Υ1Φ2Ε22; NBGHA_Α1Σ19Υ1Φ2Ε37; Zolotas (1928, p. 192); Tsalikis (1929, pp. 19-20).

6.2. Ending Monetary Instability
In the Greek literature, the timing of the stabilisation of the drachma is seen as a consequence of
political change and institutional advances that occurred in 1927: a coalition government was
formed in December 1926, the war debt with Great Britain was settled,338 subsequently the
financial embargo which had been imposed on the country was lifted,339 and recourse was made
to the League of Nations.340 Fiscal developments are also regarded as having played a role in
bringing about stabilisation.341 Foreign capital is treated as a prerequisite for stabilisation. The
possibility of achieving stabilisation from domestic resources through an expenditure
retrenchment or increase in taxation or both is not considered in the literature as it was
completely ignored as an option by policy makers in the late 1920s. In short, stabilisation is
explained as a natural outcome of the steps that the government took: to settle its war debts and
to resort to an outside agent in order to raise capital from the international financial markets.
Changes in the fiscal policy of the Greek government in order to stabilise the drachma
were neither abrupt nor fundamental. On the contrary, it is argued here that fiscal policy did not
change and that budget deficits persisted. What changed was the way in which the government
borrowed. They stopped monetising their budget deficits and turned to the international
financial markets.
In the example of Greece, fiscal consolidation was not achieved in the way that the
Financial Committee of the League intended it and indeed as orthodox economic policy at the
time required. Then again, achieving a balanced budget before the implementation of a League
sponsored reconstruction scheme was not seen as a prerequisite by the Financial Committee.
Ordinarily, a de facto currency stabilisation was thought to be a requirement before the League
was approached. In Article V of the 1927 Geneva Protocol which refers to the budget it is stated
that ‘the Hellenic Government undertakes to make, and to persist in making, every effort to
keep the budget within the limit of about 9,000 million drachmae, until the end of the financial
year 1929–30, and to maintain thereafter a complete equilibrium between the current revenue
and current expenses of the State’.342

339 Pepelasis Minoglou (1993, p. 114) argues that ‘the British Treasury through the embargo prevented Greece from reaching stabilisation at an earlier date’.

The finance minister, before leaving Athens for Geneva in June 1927, presented the
budget for the fiscal year 1927–28 and proposed to the parliament increases in taxation.343 The
aim was to balance the budget. At the end, for the first time since the early nineteenth century,
the budget of the fiscal year 1927–28 closed in surplus.344 Subsequently, budget deficits
persisted, which is hardly surprising given the advent of the Great Depression.
By contrast, there was a significant change in policy in respect of the banknotes in
circulation and the NDBs. The last time that the government resorted to the National Bank to
borrow in forced circulation was in early March 1923. (See Table 4.4 in Chapter 4.)
Subsequently any increase in the banknotes in circulation was based on the Law of 23 April
1923, an arrangement which echoed the principles of the ΓΧΜΒ Law. Hence, any new issues of
banknotes in circulation in response to the April 1923 Law were fully covered by foreign
exchange reserves.
After the middle of 1923, one of the main causes of monetary instability and an
important source by which the government increased its revenue was the NDBs. The number of
the NDBs issued tripled in 1923. (See data in Chapter 5 where the evolution of the NDBs is
examined.) This is very vividly depicted in Figure 6.2 below where the outstanding amount of
NDBs is added together with the banknotes in circulation. As has been explained in Chapter 5,
the NDBs were a very liquid investment as their maturity was short. Furthermore, and perhaps
more importantly, the National Bank discounted them under certain conditions.
In January 1926, with no advance warning, the Second Forced Loan was imposed by
General Pagalos to deal with the issue of the NDBs. In short, all banknotes over 50 drachmae
were torn in two pieces: one part representing three-quarters of the original face value of the
banknote continued circulating as money. The remaining one-quarter of the original face value
of the banknote was converted into a 6 per cent bond of a 20-year period of maturity. The
proceeds of this forced loan which approximately amounted to one quarter of the banknotes that
were in circulation late in January 1926, were applied by the government firstly to repay its debt
to the National Bank because of the NDBs, thereby improving its liquidity, and secondly to
redeem half of the NDBs when they matured. The remaining half of the NDBs was converted
into an 8 per cent loan with an amortisation period of ten years.

344 The data to hand show that the fiscal year of 1916 ended in surplus, although marginally so. However, 1916 was a year of political turmoil so the data available may not survive scrutiny.
245


On 23 January 1926, there were approximately 1.3 billion drachmae of short-term
NDBs in circulation and 96 million drachmae of a maturity of three, five and ten years.345 On 31
December 1927, only 134 million of the short-term NDBs remained unredeemed, of which only
half were to be repaid in cash, the other half would be converted into an 8 per cent bond. By 31
March 1927, when all short-term NDBs had matured only, a tiny number (about 30 million)
remained unsettled.346 The three-, five- and ten-year NDBs of value of 96 million drachmae
would be repaid in cash in full upon their maturity.
Figure 6.2 demonstrates the impact of the Second Forced Loan on the money supply
and the NDBs. The number of banknotes in circulation had abruptly dropped by the end of
January 1926. (See Figure 5.2 in Chapter 5 and Table A3.1 in Appendix A3.) In addition, by the
end of June 1926, the outstanding amount of the NDBs had also considerably decreased. (See
also Figure 5.3 and Table 5.7 in Chapter 5.) The money supply vigorously contracted because of
the introduction of the Second Forced Loan. Subsequently, however, slowly but steadily the
banknotes in circulation increased. By May 1928, when the National Bank lost its issuing
privilege, the money supply had not reached the level that it enjoyed before the implementation
of the Second Forced Loan. Therefore, the Second Force Loan and the concomitant retirement
of the NDBs was the first major milestone towards stabilisation.

Contrary to the conventional belief and in spite of the Allies’ embargo, there was some capital
influx into Greece in particular after 1924. (See Table 5.9 in Chapter 5.) This influx was
possible because the ally embargo was applied against the central government and excluded
public entities. In addition, the Greek government could and did raise capital from smaller
capital markets and for infrastructure programmes that were being undertaken at the time.
However, raising money from small capital markets of Europe, such as with the 8.50 per cent
Swedish Loan of 1926, proved to be very expensive and the sums that could be raised were very
limited indeed.
During the period 1923–1926, the balance of payments in Greece was passive. Imports
remained high and although exports increased, this increase was limited. Invisible earnings from
remittances remained low before the stabilisation of the drachma and shipping profits improved
only after 1925.347 Overall the position of the balance of payments was improving after 1926.
The important issues in any stabilisation are the price level, the exchange rate, the
budget and the money supply. All these issues were examined above and it was shown that the
achievement of stabilisation in Greece in the 1920s was a slow procedure. To bring to a halt
hyperinflation like that experienced in Germany or Austria after the end of the Great War was
probably more spectacular than bringing about price and exchange rate stability after a long
period of high inflation. It has been argued here that a change in monetary policy played an
important role in delivering stabilisation to Greece. Fiscal policy, defined as the government’s
choice of levels of spending and taxation did not change much either before or after
stabilisation. The Stabilisation or Tripartite Loan, as it is otherwise known, reduced the
adjustment effort and served as a substitution for fiscal reforms. In addition, it provided foreign
reserves, which worked as a cushion and made possible the adoption of the gold exchange
standard. The role of the external agent, in this case the Financial Committee of the League, was
to make the stabilisation attempt credible and to guarantee the flotation of a loan on favourable
terms on the international financial markets. Institutional reforms that were introduced created a
commitment mechanism which enhanced credibility during the stabilisation attempt. In Greece,
the stabilisation plan provided for central banking reforms, which led to the establishment of a
new central bank. The statutes of the Bank of Greece incorporated rules which prevented policy
makers from altering monetary policy.
Political authorities in Greece expected that institutional developments that ended
with the establishment of a new central bank and the adoption of the gold exchange standard
347 Zolotas (1928, p. 155).
248


would facilitate an influx of foreign capital essential for economic growth. The impact,
however, that these institutional reforms have, at least in the short-run, on the cost and of
course the volume of borrowing ‘reflect external circumstances as well’.348 By May 1928, the
international economy was about to enter the most severe depression that has ever been
experienced.
6.3. Historical Background
The first stabilisation programme that was suggested to the National Bank was prepared by L.
G. Roussin, the British member of the IFC in Athens, in July 1925.349 In this stabilisation
programme he explicitly described how he envisaged the operation of a stable monetary system
and explained the causes of the monetary upheaval in Greece. He was clearly an advocate of the
quantity theory of money in contrast to the prevailing idea in the country amongst
representatives of the government and the National Bank, who blamed the position of the
balance of payments for the depreciation of the drachma. He stated that
new issues of paper money not covered by gold or foreign currency must be abstained from, even to satisfy the needs of commerce or for productive purposes. The demand for capital in the short or long term can only be satisfied by the growing resources of the
country and the multiplication of means of payment can in a way replace actual wealth.350
This was a statement clearly in contrast to the policy of the National Bank as an issuing bank at
the time, which reflected the principles of the banking school.351 L. G. Roussin also examined
the reasons that led to the monetary instability and claimed that
[t]he release of large of notes from the till of the National Bank, in order to increase its advances and to repay national war bonds, in swelling the circulation resulted in causing a demand for exchange which greatly diminished the reserve of funds abroad. Moreover, this reserve, instead of having been kept in a liquid state, had been partly tied up in bonds and
advances.352 He believed that it would have been possible to establish convertibility of the drachma at around
300 drachmae to the pound if the part of the reserves of the National Bank which were
immobile were liquidated.353
348 Drazen and Masson (1994).
349 L. G. Roussin was appointed in January 1925 and was French. Prior to 1925 the Counsellor of the Legation in Athens served as the British Member of the IFC. This arrangement had been made at the beginning of the century when Greek public finance seemed to be sound and resources allocated to the IFC were plentiful for the service of the debt under their jurisdiction.

Ioanna Pepelasis Minoglou (1993, p. 128) argues that L. G. Roussin promoted the
implementation of a stabilisation programme under the supervision of the IFC. His stabilisation
proposal, however, did not receive much attention either from the Bank of England or from the
National Bank of Greece. In 1925, the governor of the National Bank believed that thoughts of
stabilisation were still premature in view of ‘the unsettled state of public finances, the large
floating debt, the new situation created by the inflation itself, and the need for elasticity’.354
L. G. Roussin proposed a new more comprehensive stabilisation plan in March 1926.
The most innovative point of this plan was the proposition of ‘the creation of an issuing office
quite independent of the National Bank’s other departments and safeguarded by legal provisions
excluding any outside interference in its management’.355 He further suggested the unification
of the various existing issues of banknotes. In addition to these, he pointed out that
‘[s]tabilisation measures must of course be preceded or accompanied by measures for balancing
the budget and settling the floating debt, so as to exclude strictly all possibility of recourse to
arbitrary issues’.356 Roussin proposed that it would be possible to make the drachma freely
convertible at a rate of 275 drachmae to the pound sterling. This was an optimistic estimation
considering that the going market rate was approximately between 340 drachmae and 370
drachmae to the sterling in March 1926. He based this calculation on the twin presumption that
a foreign long-term credit of £2,000,000 would be made available and that the National Bank
would be reorganised and would liquidate its gold securities held as cover.357
The National Bank rejected the proposal to establish a special department of issue
because ‘the statutes of the National Bank similar to those of Banking institutions of Continental
Europe, provide for the unity of the departments of issue and the banking department.
Otherwise, the unhampered functioning of the branch offices, especially, would be rendered
impossible’.358 Pepelasis Minoglou (1993, pp. 130–132) describes the reasons that led to the
disapproval of this stabilisation scheme by both the National Bank and the Bank of England.
The governor of the National Bank, Alexandros Diomides maintained that complete freedom in
the buying and selling of foreign exchange would be impracticable, given the high tendency for
speculation in Greece and that there was not sufficient foreign credit available to stabilise.
Furthermore, he reacted strongly to Roussin’s proposal that a special issuing department be set
up at the National Bank entirely independent of the other services of the Bank and under the

control of the IFC. At the same time the Bank of England effectively blocked this proposal by
the British member of the IFC by refusing to extend the necessary credit.359
How the representatives of the National Bank of Greece envisaged achieving
stabilisation is revealed in a scheme for the stabilisation of the drachma proposed by Emmanuel
Tsouderos, the sub-governor of the National Bank, to the Bank of England in 1926. In this
scheme, he recommended the unification of all different kinds of banknote issue (examined in
detail in Chapter 4) and suggested ways by which the National Bank could increase its reserves.
As a prerequisite for stabilisation he suggested that the Bank of England would concede credits
and that in return the National Bank would accept the appointment of a ‘Special Commissioner’
proposed by the Bank of England, who would be independent from the IFC. The office of the
‘Special Commissioner’ as stated in the scheme, would last until the credit had been repaid.360
Prior to December 1926, none of the stabilisation programmes proposed could actually
lead to stabilisation. They were not stabilisation schemes accepted by all parties and none of
them guaranteed external financial assistance. They highlighted, however, differences in the
way that Greeks on the one hand, and their counterparts on the other, approached the question of
stabilisation. The Greek delegation saw as imperative the raising of a big external loan without
envisaging any institutional changes. By contrast, both the Bank of England and the IFC urged
institutional reforms, although not as sweeping as the ones that the Financial Committee of the
League of Nations required.
Stabilisation also proved to be difficult because there was not sufficient political
stability in the country and the problem of war debts with the Allies had not been settled. Clause
four of the 1918 Paris Agreement blocked the Greek government’s access to the international
capital markets, since every time that the Greek government wanted to float a foreign loan it
was required to ask permission of Britain, France and the USA. In addition to this difficulty,
Pepelasis Minoglou (1993, p. 110) says that in the late autumn of 1925 or early winter of 1926
the British Treasury imposed an embargo in the City after Greco-British negotiations for the
determination of the net war debt and the mode of payment reached deadlock.
Some fiscal measures were taken in 1926. The government of General Pangalos
implemented unpopular austerity measures and decreased the number of public servants;
nevertheless, overall public expenditure rose by 27 per cent in 1926 due to an increase in
359 Pepelasis Minoglou (1993, pp. 131–132).

251


military expenditure. However, as has been noted above, a turning point towards stabilisation
was the retirement of the NDBs in early 1926.
6.4. Recourse to the League of Nations
By the time that the coalition government was formed, on 4 December 1926, it was universally
recognised in the country that stabilisation should be achieved as soon as possible. A few days
later, on 10 December 1926, a Committee of Greek Experts was appointed to examine the
public finances of the country and to suggest measures for their improvement. The Committee
announced its results to the Greek government at the end of February 1927. They suggested the
unification of the budget and economies in military and naval expenditure, in pensions and in
civil administration. They encouraged an increase in revenues by means other than taxation in
order that budget deficits be avoided in the future. In addition, they suggested stabilisation of the
drachma at the prevailing market rate.361 The Committee of Greek Experts perceived
stabilisation as a matter of technicality, but at the same time as a prerequisite together with the
settlement of the war debt in order for foreign capital to flow into the country again.
The general view in the country was that monetary stability could only be achieved
with a large loan from abroad, which would provide the capital needed for the completion of the
refugee settlement and the stabilisation of the drachma. It is significant that the Greek
Committee of Experts did not envisage any institutional changes. They recommended cuts in
public expenditure and a return to capital markets as preconditions to achieving monetary
stability, but on the other hand they dismissed the issue of public revenue. By contrast, in
France, at roughly the same time, political truce and broad consensus led to monetary
stabilisation by means of increased revenues through taxation, which assured persistent
balanced or surplus government budgets in the future.
Pepelasis Minoglou (1993, p. 134) argues that Diomides was against the involvement of
the League of Nations because of theoretical differences over the nature of stabilisation and the
operation of central banking. It is not clear from the evidence she provides that the governor of
the National Bank et al. were aware of the central banking reform that the involvement of the
Financial Committee of the League of Nations in the stabilisation process in Greece would
entail. The help and involvement of the Bank of England was welcomed, in spite of the fact that
Greek bankers held different views on monetary issues from those of the Bank of England

whose after all theoretical position dominated the Financial Committee of the League. From the
end of 1925 the practice developed was of turning, not to the League of Nations, but to one or
more of the major national central banks for assistance. In this way four countries – Belgium,
Italy, Poland and Rumania – stabilised their currencies in the years 1926–28.362
Recourse to the League of Nations involved stringent controls and, as archival material
reveals, the Greek government was anxious to avoid any kind of control or any sort of foreign
intervention into Greek public affairs because of the political cost that such intervention
entailed. Nor were they prepared to extend the rights of the IFC.363 Furthermore, during the
negotiations for the settlement of the war debts with Britain, the Greek government suggested
surrendering its claim to the remainder of the Book Credits granted under the agreement of
February 1918, provided that the British Treasury would support them in their efforts to obtain
credits from the London market of an equivalent amount, that is to say 5.5 million sterling, to
stabilise the drachma.364 Needless to say, this proposition was not accepted by the Treasury, and
the Bank of England’s advice was recourse to the League of Nations.
As late as 30 March 1927, the Greek minister of finance, George Kaphandaris,
maintained that a League of Nations plan would be disadvantageous for the country.365 A few
days later the British war debt settlement was signed and a few weeks after that the League
Secretariat was ‘invited’ to examine financial conditions in Greece. A mission was sent to
Greece in April 1927. This committee was headed by Joseph Avenol and its members were E.
Felkin, Jacques Rueff and J. Von Walre de Bordes, all members of the Financial Committee of
the League of Nations. At the end of May, they submitted to the Secretariat a long report which
dealt with the accounts of the Treasury, the budget, the National Bank and the general economic
situation in the country.366 In this report, as has been noted before, a lot of attention was paid to
the National Bank and its dual-purpose character.
In the proceedings of the 27th session of the Financial Committee which was held
between 8 and 14 June, the implementation of a Greek reconstruction plan was discussed in
detail.367 The Greek delegation, which was headed by the minister of finance Georgios
Kaphandaris, and a member of which was the sub-governor of the National Bank Emmanuel
362 Meyer (1970, p. 3).

Tsouderos, was asked privately to answer questions which dealt with the reforms that the
Financial Committee requested.368 These questions referred to the budget, to the way the
proceeds of the loan would be used, to changes of the National Bank ‘to bring [it] closer to
conformity with modern central banking’, and to the appointment of a foreign advisor to the
central bank. These questions constituted the main points of what later became a stabilisation
programme for Greece. They were all accepted in principle, but with the appointment of an
advisor with extended powers.369 On the last day of the proceedings in Geneva, the Greek
minister of finance made an official request to the League to raise under its aegis a loan of 9
million pounds sterling and the Financial Committee asked the Council to approve the
reconstruction scheme for Greece. The Council accepted the plan in principle but reserved the
right to approve it in its September session.
The original idea of the Financial Committee was that the existing bank of issue, the
National Bank of Greece – which, as has been discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, pursued public
responsibilities and at the same time was the most powerful commercial bank in Greece 
should be reformed by winding up or transferring to other institutions all those parts of its
activities which would not normally fall within the scope of a central bank. This idea was
embodied in the Committee’s June report. The Protocol, however, that was signed in September
spoke about the establishment of a new, independent, fully fledged central bank. The
establishment of a new fully fledged central bank, the Bank of Greece, is examined in detail in
Chapter 7.
The Geneva Protocol also stated that fiscal consolidation and de jure stabilisation of the
Greek currency could be achieved with a loan of 9 million sterling, of which 3 million would be
available for the settlement of refugees, 3 million for budget arrears and 3 million for
strengthening the newly established central bank. Article V of the Geneva Protocol referred to
the budget, saying that the Hellenic government had to undertake to make, and to persist in
making, every effort to keep the budget within the limit of about 9 billion drachmae, until the
end of the financial year 1929–1930, and to ‘maintain thereafter a complete equilibrium
between the current revenue and current expenses of the government’.370 In addition, they had
to send every three months a report on the situation of the budget for a period of three years
following stabilisation. Advances and treasury bills or other similar short-term obligations were

limited to 800 million drachmae. Finally, Greece undertook to create a new system of public
accounting in conformity with the principle of the unity of the budget.371
6.5. Comparison of the League stabilisation plans
In this section, a comparison between the Greek stabilisation plan and the other plans that were
prepared by the Financial Committee will be attempted. The Financial Committee had
implemented six reconstruction schemes (Austria, Hungary, Greece, Bulgaria, Danzig and
Estonia) and had prepared another three for Albania, Portugal and Rumania which were never
executed. In Greece and Bulgaria the League of Nations stepped in twice, at first to assist with
the settlement of refugees and then to involve itself in currency stabilisation.372
The League reconstruction programmes can be broadly divided into two parts: the
making of a loan and the conditions attached to the scheme in order for the League to supervise
the making of the loan. In each case, a big foreign loan was issued under the aegis of the
Financial Committee of the League. It was generally speaking difficult for those countries
which resorted to the League of Nations to borrow independently from the international capital
markets. Their creditworthiness was low reflecting their internal economic and monetary
conditions. The money loaned to the government was to
afford a breathing-space during which inflation could be arrested and the state could settle down to living within its means, and at the same time the actual foreign exchange proceeds of the loan would strengthen the position of the central bank, and pave the way for
exchange stability on the basis of free convertibility.373
Institutional reforms, changes in fiscal and monetary policy and a mechanism of
stringent control were introduced as conditions by the League. This conditionality bound
governments to follow planned policy in the future. The most important institutional change in
all reconstruction schemes was central banking reforms ‘on the lines recommended at
Brussels’.374 Accounting or auditing offices were also reorganised. The objective was to achieve
better control and monitoring of public finances by a central authority.375
In all the cases a plan was drawn up in order for the country to balance its budget. In
most of the cases a balanced budget was not regarded by the League of Nations as a prerequisite

372 In Greece, the League intervened for the first time in 1923 and then in 1927; in Bulgaria in 1926 and then again in 1928.

to a country adopting convertibility. All the stabilisation programmes, however, spoke about
fiscal consolidation and asked for guarantees that this would be achieved in the future.
Some sort of supervision was imposed in all cases. In Austria and Hungary and later in
Bulgaria a foreign Commissioner-General was sent to control the proceeds of the loan.376 A
foreign advisor was appointed in the central bank of the countries which resorted to the League
of Nations. Both the foreign advisor to the bank and the Commissioner-General reported to the
Council regularly according to the rules set out in the League Protocol. In Greece, the presence
of the IFC made the question of supervision a more complicated one.377 The IFC was
responsible for servicing the government’s foreign debt under their aegis. It should be noted
here that the idea of introducing an international commission similar in structure to the IFC in
Greece was incorporated in the first drafts of the scheme for Austria but it was subsequently
dropped from the final Protocol.378 Nevertheless, a foreign advisor was appointed to the newly
established central bank in Greece and the servicing of both League loans that Greece had raised
in the 1920s was assumed by the IFC.
It is widely recognised that the League reconstruction schemes were comprehensive
and effective, since inflation was immediately curbed in all cases. Institutional changes mainly
focused on monetary policy and fiscal reforms were introduced that made the stabilisation
programmes credible. Ending inflation was promoted as a fiscal phenomenon in the schemes. In
addition, all these plans made provision for the flotation of a big international loan which was
regarded as a pre-condition for currency stabilisation in the countries where the League
intervened.
6.6. The making of the loan
The making of the Stabilisation Loan is briefly examined here. The Stabilisation Loan is also
known as the Tripartite Loan because it served three purposes: one-third of the loan went
towards budget arrears, one-third to the central bank and one-third to the refugees.
The settlement of the war debts with the USA was tied up to this loan. The Americans
indicated that they would block any issue of the loan on the American market unless the war
debts with Greece were settled.379 Aware of this possibility, negotiations were entered into and
376 The Commissioner-General remained in those countries until 30 June 1926.

an agreement was reached on 6 December 1927. As part of the settlement the Greek
government renounced its claim to the remaining Book Credits, and in return the American
government promised to release credit amounting to 2.5 million pounds sterling or 12.167
million American dollars on account of the American share of the 1918 Book Credits. Since this
American credit would be employed directly by the RSC for the rehabilitation of refugees, it
was then arranged that a 6.5 million pounds sterling Stabilisation Loan would be floated on the
capital markets instead of a loan of 9 million pounds as the Geneva Protocol had indicated. The
proceeds of this 6.5 million pound loan were then allocated as follows: 3 million pounds was
earmarked for the budget, 3 million pounds for the central bank and only 500 thousand pounds
for the refugees.
The 2.5 million pounds loan from the American government, which became known as
the Second Refugee Loan was issued at par, had a 4 per cent interest rate and a 20 year
redemption period. This was a very favourable agreement for the Greek government. It was not
certain, however, until the spring of 1929 that the credit would in fact be transferred, as the
American Congress delayed giving its approval. It was expected to pass a resolution in March
1928 but only did so finally on 10 May 1929.
Archival Material shows great cooperation between the Bank of England (Montagu
Norman and Otto Niemeyer) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (Benjamin Strong and
George Harrison) to overcome difficulties and arrange for part of the Stabilisation Loan to be
issued on the New York market. The Bank of England wanted the loan to be an international
loan and for as many markets to participate as possible. This was either because Montagu
Norman genuinely believed that ‘it is not reasonable, even if it were possible, that London
should issue any part of the proposed Loan without the co-operation of America’380 or that he
doubted that Greece would be able to raise this amount of money in Europe alone.381 On the
other hand, the relationship, as it appears in the archival material between the Bank of England
and the Bank of France, was not as strong as that between the Federal Reserve Bank of New
York and the Bank of England. In the end France did not participate and no part of the loan was
floated in France.
Two banks competed to underwrite the Stabilisation Loan: the Hambros Bank, which
was considered to be ‘the Bankers of the Greeks’,382 and the American house of Blair & Co.

Table 6.3 shows the various offers made by each house.383 At the end, Hambros obtained the
loan with an offer that was regarded as being extremely ‘favourable to Greeks’.384 It is possible
that Hambros made this offer under some pressure from the British Treasury and Foreign Office
to secure the business.385

The Stabilisation Loan had a coupon rate of 6 per cent, the price of issue was 91 and net 86. In
addition, its amortisation period was 40 years. The Geneva Protocol of September 1927 placed
the new League of Nations loan under the jurisdiction of the IFC without the Greek government
having to assign to it additional revenues. As has been noted above, these terms were very
favourable to the Greek government and this was recognised in the literature by
contemporaneous scholars.386 Table 6.4 presents all the loans that were issued under the
auspices of the League and their terms are compared. It is noticeable that the terms and
conditions of the Greek Stabilisation Loan were more advantageous than the others.

The flotation of the loan was launched simultaneously in London and in New York on 31
January 1928. On 20 January 1928, nearly ten days before issue, when agreement had been
already reached, The Times wrote: ‘it would be interesting to know why it is expected that the
public will subscribe to the new loan, which gives a yield smaller by nearly 0.50 per cent, the
security being in no way better than that of the existing [Refugee Loan]’.387 It is true that the
terms by which the Stabilisation Loan was issued surprised all the participants involved in its
flotation. In London, however, it was six times oversubscribed by the public,388 and there was
similar success in the other capital markets. Table 6.5 compares the two Greek League of
Nations loans by market percentage. Note that the flotation of the loan in Italy and Sweden was
in sterling whilst in Switzerland it was in American dollars.389 The Hambros and Erlangers were

6.7. Greek government borrowing under foreign supervision in 1898 and 1928:
parallels and contrasts390
According to George Leontaritis (1990, p. 195) ‘Greece has always lived beyond her
resources’. Not only has she borrowed heavily, but by 1932 she had defaulted on her sovereign
debt four times.391 As a consequence the country experienced financial embargoes, foreign
intervention into its monetary policy and control of its fiscal revenues. A byzantine relationship
arose between the Greek government and its foreign creditors, making an historical analysis of
Greek public debt and the conditionality that often accompanied it even more compelling.
In the late 1920s, three foreign institutions were based in Athens as a consequence of
the 1893 default and government borrowing under the aegis of the League of Nations in the
1920s: the IFC, the RSC and the financial advisor to the Bank of Greece. The IFC, established
in 1898, was mainly a debt management committee responsible for the service of the
government debt placed under its jurisdiction. A special body, the RSC, was established in
1923 to administer the proceeds of the First Refugee Loan and to carry out the settlement of
refugees mainly in rural areas. The RSC was an autonomous body, its statutes having been
developed by the Financial Committee of the League of Nations, and it was under the strict
supervision of the League Council. In 1928, H. O. Finlayson was appointed as advisor to the
Bank of Greece, a clause in the Geneva Protocol that Greek representatives went to great
lengths to avoid. In the end, there was a compromise and the financial advisor to the newly
established central bank did not have the power of veto. Its role was to oversee the activities
and policies pursued by the Bank of Greece and to report regularly to the Council of the
League.
This thesis examines in depth the Geneva Protocol of 1927 prepared by the Financial
Committee of the League and refers extensively to the 1898 Law of Control. The two
historical periods covered, that is to say the 1890s which led to the introduction of the Law of
Control and the 1920s, were very different. Whereas in 1893 the Greek government defaulted
on its external debt obligations, in the 1920s none of the Greek governments, despite the
difficulties they encountered in financing public expenditure, considered default an option.
The humiliation of the military defeat of 1922, combined with the transaction costs and the
390 Pepelasis Minoglou (1993, pp. 202–204) in her thesis makes a ‘temporal comparison’ between the 1898 Law of Control and the League of Nations Stabilisation scheme of 1928. She sees the similarities as factual and in the nature of the interests that both organisations represent. In her analysis, the differences are also of this nature.
391 The first episode of default is broadly regarded as having occurred even before Greece became a sovereign state; this rather ‘excusable default’ occurred in 1827 during the War of Independence. See, for example, Reinhart and Trebesch (2015); Dertilis (2016). The other three default episodes took place in 1844, 1893 and 1932.
261


embarrassment of the 1893 default which still loomed large in politicians’ minds in Athens, as
well as the belief that foreign capital would be forthcoming, led governments to opt for
controversial measures to cover expenditure rather than ceasing to honour their foreign
obligations.392
Military defeat is a common characteristic of both historical periods. In 1898, Greece
had to pay a war indemnity in exchange for Turkish troops evacuating Thessaly. In the 1920s,
Greek governments had to settle more than a million refugees who reached Greece after the
Asia Minor debacle.
In both the late 1890s and the 1920s, the creditworthiness of the Greek government as
demonstrated by Figure 6.3 below was very low. In the 1890s, the Greek government did not
have access to the international financial markets as a consequence of default. Furthermore,
the negotiations with foreign bondholders proved to be difficult and protracted. It took five
years and a Greco-Turkish war before a compromise was reached in 1898. This compromise
resulted in the stipulation of the Law of Control which provided detailed instructions for the
restructuring of Greek public debt and outlined the organisation and responsibilities of the
IFC. Furthermore, the Law of Control suggested some monetary changes.
The literature argues that in the 1920s the Greek government was unable to borrow
from the international financial markets because of embargoes imposed by the Allies either
for ‘political and strategic considerations’ or to force Greece to settle its war debt.393 It is
further argued that in this way stabilisation was delayed.394 In the 1920s, the London market
‘was not the free market of the pre-war days’.395 After 1918, an embargo on overseas loans was
introduced, though with some reluctance on the part of the London authorities, as a new
instrument of monetary policy.396 Later, it was also used as a ‘useful political lever to force a
prompt settlement’ of war debts to Britain.397 Governments that had not settled their war debts
to Britain were not permitted to raise capital on the London market.
Figure 6.3 provides a graphic demonstration of why Greek governments faced
considerable difficulties in raising capital on the financial markets in the 1920s, beyond the
international politics and embargoes referred to in the literature. In the early 1920s, Greek
392 The most controversial measure adopted was the Forced Loan of April 1922. The experiment was repeated in 1926. For more, see Chapter 5 of this thesis.

government bonds plummeted and as a consequence market rates rocketed, reflecting the
political, economic and financial distress that prevailed in Athens during that period. For
example, the market value of the Bonds Loan amounted to a country risk of nearly 19 per cent
in November 1922. Subsequently, the market price of Greek government debt drifted gradually
upwards and consequently, the spread between the yield of Greek government bonds and the
British consol steadily declined. The extended period of restoration of the institutions in
Greece, both political and economic, is delineated by the sovereign risk of the Greek
government on the London market which slowly but steadily improved, as Figure 6.3 below
demonstrates. Stabilisation and the concomitant institutional reforms were gradually factored
into the market price of Greek sovereign debt traded in London and as a result the
creditworthiness of the Greek government steadily improved.398
In the 1920s an international committee, the Financial Committee of the League,
prepared stabilisation programmes for several countries that borrowed capital under its aegis.
By contrast, in the late nineteenth century, bondholders organised themselves into committees
which negotiated with the government in question for a debt settlement. In the Greek
example, however, because of the 1897 war with Turkey, the Great Powers of the time
intervened and eventually a debt restructuring and resumption of the debt service was agreed
under their jurisdiction in January 1898.399

399 The mediating powers were the following: Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Austria-Hungary and Russia.

Prior to the Second World War, foreign financial advice and assistance coupled with capital
usually raised from the markets was accompanied by conditionality. Table 6.6 below compares
the conditionality introduced by the Law of Control in 1898 with that of the stabilisation plan
prepared by the Financial Committee of the League of Nations in 1928.

Both plans incorporated extensive control and supervision over monetary and public finance.
In 1898, the IFC, primarily a debt management committee, was established. In the 1920s,
both League of Nations loans that is to say the 1924 Refugee Loan and the Stabilisation Loan,
265


were placed under the aegis of the IFC and were guaranteed by revenues that the Greek
government had already assigned to the Commission. The RSC administered the proceeds of
the First Refugee Loan, to carry out the settlement of refugees in rural areas.
In 1928, the stabilisation plan incorporated foreign supervision over monetary policy
with the appointment of a financial advisor to the Bank of Greece. His main task was to
oversee the policies and activities of the newly established central bank and to report regularly
to the Council of the League. In addition, the Greek government was obliged to report to the
Council on the state of public finances every three months for a period of three years.
In the late 1890s, the central issue at the negotiations was the resumption of the debt
service of the external public debt. The Law of Control introduced a rescheduling of the public
debt denominated in gold and contracted before 1897. The debt readjustment plan that was
developed defined the minimum interest rate to be paid to the bondholders of the Old Gold
Loans, as the external loans floated before 1893 and placed under the jurisdiction of the IFC are
known. The aim, however, was to increase both the interest rate paid and the sinking fund for
the loans placed under the jurisdiction of the IFC to their full contractual level, using public
revenues earmarked for this purpose. Thus, the yield of the Old Gold Loans fluctuated within
limits from year to year depending on the volume of the surplus revenues of the IFC.
For example, the minimum rate of the Monopoly Loan was set at 43 per cent of its
original interest rate which was 4 per cent. In other words, the minimum interest rate that the
IFC had to pay the holders of the Monopoly Loan was 1.72 per cent. The interest rate paid to
Monopoly Loan bondholders during the period in question is presented in Figure 6.4 and in
Table A4.1 in Appendix A4. Figure 6.4 and Table A4.1 show that the interest rate paid in 1920
and 1921 was at the full contractual level for the first time since the introduction of the Law of
Control. Subsequently, it retained either its original level or remained close to that level.
266

Amongst the priorities of the coalition government that was formed in December 1926 was
the stabilisation of the drachma and the continuation of the settlement of refugees. By May
1928, the Greek currency had lost approximately 95 per cent of its pre-war value, with the
origin of this monetary upheaval being the monetisation of budget deficits. The Financial
Committee of the League insisted on reform of the National Bank, a dual-purpose bank, to
confine its activities to central banking responsibilities and to become independent from the
government. This proposal led to the establishment of a new central bank in Greece in 1928
with a clear mandate: to ensure the stability of the external value of the drachma. Through
conditionality, therefore, creditors promoted institutions akin to those prevailed in their
countries.
The Law of Control also introduced a degree of monetary discipline in Greece and
independence for the National Bank. Article 30 strictly prohibited the National Bank from
using the printing press to lend to the government without the consent of the IFC until the
debt in banknotes from forced circulation had been fully paid off.
In 1898, Great Britain, France and Russia guaranteed jointly and severally the
flotation of the loan.400 As a result the terms under which the Guaranteed Loan was issued
were very favourable; its interest rate for example was only 2.50 per cent and the amortisation
400 Wynne (1951, p. 319).

period 60 years. The proceeds of this loan were used for the payment of the war indemnity to
Turkey, to cover the budget deficit for 1897, to retire the floating debt denominated in gold
and for the service of the Old Gold Loans for 1898.401
Figure 6.5 demonstrates the market performance of the 2.50 per cent Guaranteed
Loan between 1898 and 1930. In addition, the market rate of this 1898 Loan is compared with
that of the British consols and other Greek loans traded on the London Stock Exchange during
this period. It is evident that the yield of the 1898 Guaranteed Loan remained close to that of
consols and its movement did not resemble that of the other Greek loans traded on the London
market.
By 1927, the creditworthiness of the Greek government on the London market had
improved significantly. The drachma had also exhibited considerable stability. The
government, however, was unable to secure by itself the entire amount of capital needed for
reconstruction and further settlement of refugees at a reasonable cost. The role that the
League played here was twofold. Firstly, the Financial Committee defined the amount of
capital and the terms under which a loan could be raised and secondly a stabilisation
programme that incorporated reforms was prepared. The way that the proceeds of the loan
could be used was also specified. In this way, the League facilitated access to capital markets
by signalling that a country would follow prudent fiscal and monetary policies in the future.
By contrast to loans issued in the late nineteenth century under the aegis of the Great
Powers, the coupon rate of the League loans was close to the market yield of the country that
floated the loan. In this way the creditworthiness of the country in question was denoted.
For example, the coupon rate of both Greek League loans was set close to the market
rate of the other Greek government loans traded on the London market at the time.
Subsequently, the market rate of both loans fluctuated on the capital markets in the same way
as the other Greek loans denominated in gold. This is illustrated in Figure 6.5 below, where
the market yield of the two Greek League of Nations loans, that is to say the Refugee Loan of
1924 and the Stabilisation Loan, is compared with that of the 1910 Bonds Loan.

7.1. Introduction
The cornerstone of the reconstruction scheme that the Financial Committee of the League
prepared for Greece was the establishment of a fully fledged central bank de novo, that is the
Bank of Greece, which started operations on 14 May 1928, two days after the gold exchange
standard was officially adopted. On that same date, the old National Bank, the central bank in
Greece since 1842, opened its doors for business for the first time in its history as a pure
commercial banking institution. Prior to this, on 31 January 1928 the Stabilisation Loan was
successfully floated in London and New York.
Section two of this chapter explores the negotiations between the Financial Committee
of the League and Greek officials that led to the establishment of a central bank in Greece and
the different positions of the participants in the negotiations are described. The reasons that
impeded the metamorphosis of the National Bank, the precursor of the central bank in the
country, from a dual-purpose bank into a fully fledged central banking institution are also

establishment of the Bank of Greece. The objectives and functions of the new central bank are
illustrated in section three whilst section four looks at its financial position upon
commencement of operations.
7.2. Path towards inevitable reform
7.2.1. Background to change
Despite a cardinal point in all League of Nations reconstruction schemes being the issue of
central banking reforms, neither the National Bank nor the Greek government seemed to
consider it a possibility that the involvement of the Financial Committee of the League in the
stabilisation process would entail such developments. They were anxious to avoid any kind of
control or any sort of foreign intervention in Greek public affairs that recourse to the League
might involve.403 However, Joseph Avenol, the deputy Secretary-General of the League, who
headed a committee that visited Greece in April 1927 to investigate economic conditions in the
country, informed the National Bank unofficially that it should be reformed in line with the
principles of modern central banking.404 A considerable part of the report that this committee
prepared for the Financial Committee of the League was devoted to the National Bank, to the
way it functioned, its multifaceted character and its role as the central bank in the country.405
In the Spring of 1927, when the League representatives visited Athens to investigate
economic conditions in the country, a new specialist institution, the National Mortgage Bank
was about to open for business. In spite of this imminent change in the status of the National
Bank at the time when the League committee was in Athens, the dual-purpose character of the
National Bank still attracted severe criticism on the part of the committee. Its activities as a
commercial bank were in stark contrast to those of an orthodox central bank. In addition, the
National Bank, as the bank of issue in the country, was thought by the League representatives to
be too close to the government. The commercial activities of the National Bank as well as its
responsibilities and privileges as the central bank in Greece, are examined in Chapters 3 and 4
of this thesis respectively. Furthermore, the relationship of the Old Bank with the government
is scrutinised in section 4.2 of Chapter 4, where changes that a long period of war and its
aftermath brought to its role as a bank of the government are also highlighted.

7.2.2. June 1927, Geneva
A Greek delegation headed by the Minister of Finance Georgios Kaphandaris, arrived in
Geneva early in June 1927 to officially request the assistance of the League of Nations in order
for Greece to obtain an international loan. The views of the Financial Committee on a
stabilisation scheme in Greece were outlined in a set of seven questions that the Greek
delegation was asked to answer.406 One of the questions dealt with the reform of the National
Bank, to bring it into closer conformity with modern central banking practice. The Greek
delegation deemed that the reform of the National Bank be entrusted to the bank itself and that it
should be implemented gradually. They also strongly objected to the appointment of a foreign
expert at the National Bank with excessive powers including the right of veto. By contrast, the
Financial Committee insisted that central banking reform should precede de jure stabilisation. In
the end, the Financial Committee gave way on the issue of foreign control, accepting that any
potential appointee should only have supervisory responsibilities whilst the Greek delegation
accepted in principle the recommendations for banking reform.407
The Financial Committee, in its report to the Council dated 14 June 1927, spelt out the
main principles that the National Bank was expected to conform to, in order to operate as a pure
central bank. These principles were: (a) the independence of the Bank, (b) the sole right of note
issue, (c) the limitation of the Bank’s operations to loan and discount transactions of a short
term and self-liquidating character, (d) the reduction of the government debt to the Bank and the
well-defined limitation of new advances to the government, (e) the centralisation of the money
transactions of the government and of government enterprises in the National Bank and (f) the
provision of adequate and appropriate cover for a unified note issue.408 These recommendations
echoed Montagu Norman’s ‘Epitome’ of central banking where he sketched out the main tenets
of the institution as it had developed by the early 1920s. (See Table 1.2 in Chapter 1.) In
addition, the Financial Committee suggested that a provision of 3 million sterling of the
prospective League sponsored loan be devoted to the reduction of the government debt to the
Bank, in order to strengthen it sufficiently for its enhanced responsibilities as a central bank.

7.2.3. Preparing for central banking reforms
A sub-committee was formed to examine central banking reform in Greece. The members of
this sub-committee were Sir Henry Strakosch (Britain),409 M. Janssen (Belgium), M. Dubois
(Switzerland), L. Osborne (representative of the Bank of England) and J. de Bordes of the
Financial Section of the League. Emmanuel Tsouderos, the deputy governor of the National
Bank, represented Greece in the talks.
The position of the representatives of the League was that the reorganisation of the
National Bank should take place within two or three months. In that time the National Bank
should be reformed by winding up or transferring to other institutions or to a new commercial
bank all those activities which did not normally fall within the scope of a central bank. These
activities included the operation of interest bearing accounts, mortgage loans, loans to the
agricultural sector and to legal entities, in short all medium- and long-term lending of the bank.
Tsouderos tried to convince the Financial Committee that in such a limited time-span a radical
reorganisation of an institution with the importance and the history of the National Bank carried
great risks for the country. Instead, he argued that reform should be implemented gradually,
spread over two or three years. He argued that the transfer of certain commercial type operations
of the Bank, such as deposits, to other institutions would seriously affect the operation of
important economic functions such as savings in the country. Although the League accepted the
argument that more time was necessary for reforms to take place, they refused to grant any
concessions in relation to the metamorphosis of the National Bank into a pure central bank.410
They declined to accept its retaining part of its commercial functions by acting as a bank for
interest bearing deposits and insisted that the Bank conform strictly to what were then
recognised as the principles of an orthodox central bank. A counter suggestion came from the
deputy governor of the National Bank: the bank could be separated into two autonomous
departments in terms of accounting and management, the issue department and the commercial
department, but both would continue to operate under the same governance. The League
rejected the proposition, arguing that the co-existence under the same direction of central
banking functions and profit-maximising commercial operations would inhibit the smooth
operation of central banking in the country.411 It should be mentioned here that the National
Bank of Greece had never previously been divided into two departments, namely the Issue
409 He was responsible for the founding of the South African Reserve Bank. Montagu Norman considered him ‘the best authority on the subject [of] the principles which should govern the policy of central banks in any country’. For more, see Cottrell (1997, p. 29).

has been argued in the literature.412
7.2.4. Opposition to the League’s proposals
Strong opposition to the proposals of the League sub-committee was expressed by the governor
of the National Bank, Alexandros Diomides, who was prepared to espouse only marginal
reforms of the business that the National Bank pursued, in spite of the fact that such a stance
might lead to the collapse of the whole stabilisation plan.413 His views on the League’s
proposals are clearly expressed in a letter written on 22 June 1927 and sent to Tsouderos.414 The
arguments that he put forward to support his position were a mixture of political rhetoric and
commercial banking rationale. The public responsibilities of the National Bank were mixed up
with the welfare of the Bank as a private, profit maximising banking institution. Diomides was
very clear as to what business he could accept the National Bank losing and did not want to
deprive the National Bank of its commercial functions. He consented to the National Bank
passing on immediately to the newly established Mortgage Bank long-term agricultural
advances of at least a three-year duration and felt that later on, this bank could also take over
responsibility for credit to the refugees.415 On the other hand, he was determined that the
National Bank should maintain the right to accept interest bearing deposits. He called the Bank
a pure ‘Banque de Depots’ and argued that the National Bank should not under any
circumstances shed this aspect of their work.416 This view of the governor of the National Bank
echoed what M. S. Eulambio, a managing director of the Bank had argued a few years before
the negotiations with the Financial Committee took place. Eulambio (1924, p. 178) had ended
his monograph on the history of the Bank by referring to its deposit character and asserting that
the National Bank’s power as an institution rested with its deposits. In his words the deposits of
the National Bank represented ‘real wealth – the wealth of the whole nation’.
The governor held that documentary credit should be allowed, and that loans or
advances on securities as well as mortgage loans should be possible on condition that they were
granted on a short-term basis. The Bank should also be allowed to grant loans and have the
freedom to invest in companies or in long-term bond loans. Finally, he argued that the National
Bank should retain its property and its investment in companies. The changes to the status of the

National Bank that its governor would not permit to take place indicate that Diomides was
ardent about preserving the commercial freedom that the Bank enjoyed.
By the 1920s, the idea of central banking had been consolidated and applied albeit to a
limited number of countries. Central banks were regarded as being non-competitive with other
commercial banks and non-profit-maximising in nature, as has been discussed in Chapter 1.
Chapter 3 of the thesis demonstrates that by 1927 these were principles that the National Bank
as the bank of issue in the country had not adopted naturally. Adoption of these attributes in
1927 would have marked the true emergence of the National Bank as a central banking
institution. The governor of the National Bank was, however, reluctant to permit this
metamorphosis of the Bank from a dual-purpose bank that pursued both central banking and
commercial functions into a fully fledged central bank in accordance with the basic tenets of the
institution as they had evolved by then. Such a transformation would have removed profitable
commercial activities from the National Bank and would have induced it to confine its activities
merely to public responsibilities as the bank of issue in Greece. Furthermore, the introduction of
the gold exchange standard was expected to generate capital inflows to the country and to create
new entrepreneurial opportunities. A National Bank bound by the constraints that govern a fully
fledged central bank would not have been able to take up any of the new opportunities that
stabilisation would offer. Its role would have been to guarantee the external value of the
drachma and to be the bank of the government. All the business of the National Bank would
have been focused on these two objectives and its portfolio would have been limited to short
term, self-liquidating assets. In addition, a substantial part of its assets would have continued to
consist of illiquid government debt, further weakening the National Bank.
Tables 3.9 and 3.10 in Chapter 3 demonstrate why the governor of the National Bank
was opposed to the Bank losing its interest bearing deposits. Table 3.9 shows government
deposits and deposits of other agencies as a percentage of the total deposits of the National Bank
between 1898 and 1930. Table 3.10 demonstrates deposits at the National Bank as a percentage
of its total liabilities between 1898 and 1920 and during a short period following stabilisation.
As it has been mentioned several times, accountancy practices that were employed during the
monetary upheaval of the 1920s obscure the real financial position of the Bank during that
period. The difficulty stems from the way that assets and liabilities denominated in gold and
foreign exchange were reported in the balance sheet of the Bank. Therefore, it may not be an
accurate exercise to extend the estimates presented in Table 3.10 into the 1920s.
Deposits of a fully fledged central bank consist of government deposits and deposits of
the banking sector. Tables 3.9 and 3.10 show that deposits of the government, both as a
276


percentage of total deposits and as a percentage of total liabilities, constituted only a small part
of total deposits of the National Bank. In addition, their volumes fluctuated considerably not
only from year to year but also throughout the year according to the service of public debt and
other obligations of the government. A portion of the liabilities of the National Bank was held
by other commercial banks which received an interest rate of 1 per cent for their deposits at the
National Bank when the League representatives visited Athens in April 1927.417 Deposits of
other banks at the National Bank were, however, very volatile as they rose and fell according to
seasonal patterns in the country. For example in 1926, deposits of banks at the Athens and
Piraeus offices of the Old Bank fluctuated from about 18 per cent of its total sight deposits to
less than 6 per cent.418 Commercial banks used to deposit with the National Bank, but they did
not resort to it for re-discounting facilities. They preferred to acquire short-term credits from
abroad where they could obtain more favourable interest rates.419
Restricting the deposits of the National Bank to non-interest bearing deposits, i.e.
deposits from the government and the commercial banks, such as a central bank can accept,
would have caused both the size and the importance of the Bank as a commercial institution
to contract severely. In fact, its commercial aspect would have been eclipsed as the Financial
Committee of the League of Nations suggested. If the National Bank had agreed to lose its
interest bearing deposits then it would have been left without the means to expand its size and
its activities in the future. In short, it would have lost one of the main sources of its lending
power, namely interest bearing deposits; the others being its capital including its lottery loans
and the issuing privilege. The National Bank had been the issuing bank in the country but ‘to
a large extent’ it had obtained its means to grant credits from its deposits.420 In the past, new
issues of banknotes had been used to finance the expenditure of the government of the day
and represented government debt in the assets of the National Bank. In 1927, the country was
about to adopt the gold exchange standard. This implied that the central bank would have to
abide by a monetary rule which did not allow the use of the issuing privilege liberally.
The inflationary period of the 1920s had exerted a negative influence on the balance
sheet of the National Bank as it was a lender in nominal drachmae both to the private sector of
the economy and to the government. As it is extensively discussed in Chapter 4, a
considerable part of its assets was tied to illiquid government debt, as lending to the

government increased considerably during this period and the terms of this lending were very
favourable for the government. Furthermore, as Table 3.5 in Chapter 3 of this thesis and Table
2 in ‘Banking Reform and the Establishment of the Bank of Greece’421 both demonstrate, total
credits to the economy as well as deposits of other agencies as a percentage of GDP shrank
substantially after the outbreak of the First World War, indicating ‘a loosing of the links’422
between the National Bank and the economy.
The National Bank had always pursued commercial activities in a conservative and
risk-averse fashion, and loans were granted cautiously as it has been repeatedly maintained in
this thesis. Furthermore, its commercial aspect had always been very important for its
financial strength. By 1927, the National Bank remained a private dual-purpose institution. As
a joint stock bank, its governors had a ‘duty to the proprietors’ which was to produce
dividends by maintaining its commercial strength.
The National Bank pursued the implementation of a stabilisation plan, accompanied by
the issue of an international loan in order to liquidate part of the government debt that was tied
to its assets. This would improve the liquidity of the National Bank and put it in a position to
expand its commercial business and take advantage of the new opportunities that convertibility
and capital inflows would create, so as to regain ground lost because of war and monetary
upheaval. At the same time, however, the Financial Committee of the League was promoting
the metamorphosis of the National Bank into a fully fledged central bank, a course which would
restrict its business mainly to discounting and confine its duties to public responsibilities.
Clearly, the way in which the governors of the National Bank had envisaged stabilisation
affecting the status of the National Bank showed a marked difference in thinking from that of
the Financial Committee of the League.
7.2.5. Tsouderos’ proposition: the ‘deus ex machina’
The negotiations between the Greek side and the representatives of the League were about to
reach a stalemate in late June 1927, since there was a fundamental disagreement over the way
that each side envisaged the stabilisation of the drachma as affecting the status of the National
Bank.
At this point, Emmanuel Tsouderos suggested to the sub-committee of the League
responsible for central banking reform in Greece an alternative solution which at the time
421 See Christodoulaki (2002).
422 Bouvier (1984, p. 36).
278


appeared to be innovative: the National Bank would continue its commercial functions and
instead it would transfer to a new bank its privilege of note issue and those of its other activities
which were usually carried on by a central bank. Tsouderos, without consulting the governor of
the National Bank, presented this solution to members of the League committee, who promptly
accepted it. Only one member of the sub-committee of the League, M. Dubois, voiced doubts
about Tsouderos’ proposal to create a New Bank of Issue and for the National Bank to be
transformed into a purely commercial bank. Dubois argued that according to this plan ‘the new
bank would not have sufficient standing and would not be strong enough to control the financial
market’.423 In Athens, neither the National Bank nor the minister of finance objected to this
scheme when they were informed. Greek officials involved in the negotiations with the
Financial Committee of the League saw this option as the best solution that, on the one hand,
would not undermine the National Bank, and on the other would allow the flotation of an
international loan under the auspices of the League to go ahead. In fact, they believed that this
alternative option would work in favour of the National Bank. The New Bank of Issue would
develop close links with the National Bank and business that would officially belong to the new
central bank would continue to be carried out in branches of the National Bank.424 This
proposition from the deputy governor of the National Bank led to the establishment of a fully
fledged central bank de novo in Greece, the Bank of Greece.
The statutes of the New Bank of Issue for Greece were fairly closely drafted in
accordance with Estonian and Indian precedents.425 They were prepared by Osborne and de
Bordes under the supervision of Strakosch at the Bank of England in early July 1927. Tsouderos
took part in the discussions on a consultative basis, suggesting ‘only a few alterations’.426
News about possible central banking reforms in Greece appeared in the British press
on the same day that the Greek representatives in Geneva officially asked the Council to
authorise a Stabilisation Loan for Greece. The Financial News of 15 June reported that the
National Bank, under the League’s scheme, ‘would be transformed into an issue bank and
would engage a foreign advisor’.427 Some central banking reforms would in any event, have
been anticipated by the markets, as they were an integral part of all the League sponsored
reconstruction schemes that had preceded the Greek stabilisation plan. Three weeks later, The
Economist published a long article on the negotiations between Greek officials and the
Financial Committee of the League. It was reported that a prerequisite for the flotation of a

League sponsored loan was that the Greek parliament authorised ‘the gradual conversion of
the National Bank of Greece into a central bank of issue of modern type’.428 By that time,
however, not only the manner of central banking reform in Greece had been agreed upon, but
the statutes of the New Bank had been drafted.429
The architects of the reform at first withheld and then influenced the release of news
of the establishment of the Bank of Greece. On 17 July, the day that the ministers of finance
and foreign affairs returned to Athens, the first reference to the creation of a new central bank
appeared in the Greek press as an option under consideration.430 The first public
announcements by the minister of finance to the press stated clearly that two plans were being
considered: the government was thinking either of transforming ‘the National Bank into a
pure bank of issue by transferring all its other functions to another bank’ or of forming ‘a new
independent bank of issue’.431 When Tsouderos returned to Athens at the end of July, he
brought with him the final draft of the statutes of the Bank of Greece and a convention between
the National Bank and the government which settled the constitution of the New Bank including
the early loss of the issuing privilege by the National Bank.432
By early August 1927, details of the sweeping reforms had been made known
publicly, as had been the opposition of the leader of the Populist Party to the arrangements
provided by the Geneva Protocol. The Populist Party led by Panayis Tsaldaris withdrew from
the coalition government, protesting against the establishment of a new fully fledged central
bank in the country. It was their view that the National Bank should not be deprived of its
issuing privilege. The Populist Party’s disagreement with the Geneva Stabilisation Plan ignited
considerable opposition to the New Bank of Issue which was to haunt the institution and
threaten its existence for years to come. A reshuffled government brought the stabilisation plan
to parliament, which ratified it the following December, the Populist Party being absent.
Previously, the Council of the League had approved the scheme in its September session.
It took less than two months from the day that the Greek delegation arrived in Geneva
until Emmanuel Tsouderos returned to Greece armed with the Geneva Protocol which spelt
out in detail central banking reforms in the country and formed the legal basis of the
stabilisation scheme in Greece. By contrast, it took approximately ten months from the day
428 The Economist, 9 July, 1927. The requirements set by the League for the re-organisation of the National Bank to operate as a central bank of issue and maintain the stable value of the drachma were also stated.

that Tsouderos arrived in Athens until the Bank of Greece opened for business in May 1928.
Prior to this, on 1 March 1928 in an extraordinary meeting, the shareholders of the National
Bank unanimously ratified the reform of the Bank that its governors had decided. A
prerequisite for the Bank of Greece to open its doors for business was that the Stabilisation
Loan had already been floated. Delays in the launch of the Stabilisation Loan due to the fact
that Greece had not reached an agreement regarding war debts with the USA delayed the start
of operations of the Bank of Greece.
The political authorities expected that institutional developments resulting in the
establishment of a central bank and the adoption of the gold exchange standard would
facilitate an influx of foreign capital essential for economic growth. However, by May 1928
the Greek government had over-borrowed and the international economy was about to enter
the most severe depression ever experienced. A few months after Greece adopted the gold
exchange standard, in December 1928, a loan for public works with a nominal value of 4
million pounds was issued on the London market, on similar terms to those of the
Stabilisation Loan. Only one-third of this loan was covered. A month later, in January 1929,
the Greek government signed an agreement with Seligman & Co for a loan with a nominal
value of up to 54 million dollars.433 The agreement provided for the flotation of a loan on
terms similar to the Stabilisation Loan on the condition that the IFC would assume
responsibility for its service. Seligman would take responsibility for any part of the loan that
remained uncovered. On 30 October 1929, the Evening Standard announced the cancellation
of this loan.434 The official reason for the termination of this agreement was that the IFC had
refused to assume responsibility for the service of this loan.435 The timing of the termination
of the agreement, however, is more revealing than the official announcement.
7.3. Bank of Greece: objectives and functions
Autonomy was incorporated in the statutes of the Bank of Greece which at the time were
regarded as the most modern of their kind.436 The macro function of a central bank, that is
responsibility for monetary management, can be clearly traced to the statutes for the new central
bank in Greece, together with the other main principles that the Financial Committee followed
433 The nominal value of this loan in sterling was approximately 11 million, close to that of the Refugee Loan of 1924. This means that the Seligman Loan was potentially a bigger lending operation than the Stabilisation Loan.

when they were involved in central banking reforms. The Bank of Greece, however, was not
initially intended to be the bankers’ bank, as none of the characteristics of a central bank
associated with its micro function were set out in its charters.
The prime objective that was assigned to the New Bank was to ensure the convertibility
of the currency.437 To achieve this aim the Bank should ‘exercise control within the limits of its
statutes over currency and credit in Greece’ and it was granted a monopoly over the right of
issuing banknotes.438 It was, however, stipulated in the statutes that the issuing privilege could
‘be revoked at any time’439 if the Bank of Greece failed to ensure that the gold value of its notes
remained stable, a clause that put the New Bank in a precarious position, in particular after the
collapse of the Gold Standard in 1931. The ultimate power to suspend the minimum reserve
ratio that the Bank of Greece was obliged to hold was handed over to the government.440
The statutes of the New Bank laid down a minimum 40 per cent of reserve against its
notes in circulation and other demand liabilities.441 The term reserve was defined in its statutes
to include gold coin and bullion in the ownership of the New Bank and net foreign gold
exchange. In the way that ‘net foreign gold exchange’ was described, it could also include bills
of exchange payable in a foreign currency maturing within three months and bearing at least
two good signatures, and treasury bills of a foreign government maturing within three months.
A temporary provision was included which allowed the New Bank to hold in its reserves during
the first five years of its existence, the bonds of the Greek government denominated in gold that
the National Bank had passed on to the newly established central bank.442
Provision was made so that at the request of the Bank of Greece, the government could
suspend the full reserve requirements for up to 30 days in the first instance and subsequently to
renew this temporary suspension for further periods of not exceeding 15 days each. In such
cases, the New Bank had to pay a tax to the government and to raise its discount rate by not less
than 1 per cent per annum during the period of suspension.443 These provisions in the statutes of
the Bank of Greece, which were related to the regulation of note issue and to the reserve
requirements, were very close to the basic stipulations of the Federal Reserve Act of the USA in

its amended 1917 form.444 By then, the system of a partial fiduciary note issue associated with
the Bank of England and dating back to the Bank Act of 1844 had been renounced; the major
weakness of which was thought to be its lack of elasticity. This new means of regulating
banknotes in circulation, first seen in the statutes of the Reichsbank when it was established in
1875 and subsequently modified and improved in the USA, were adopted by most of the central
banks established or reformed in the 1920s, as they provided a high degree of elasticity in note
circulation without at the same time undermining its credibility.
The administration of the New Bank was entrusted to a Board of Directors. This Board
consisted of the governor, the deputy governor and nine directors. At least three of the directors
were to represent the industrial and commercial sectors of the country and three the agricultural
sector. The first Board of Directors, including the governor and the deputy governor, was
appointed by the government in agreement with the National Bank.445 Subsequently, it was
entirely the responsibility of the shareholders to elect the Board of Directors but the government
was to approve the election of the governor.446 The government had the power to appoint a
commissioner who would have veto powers over decisions that were deemed to be contrary to
the statutes of the New Bank or other laws of the state.447 Alexandros Diomides, the governor of
the National Bank, was appointed as the first governor of the Bank of Greece and Emmanuel
Tsouderos, the sub-governor of the National Bank, as the first deputy governor of the New
Bank.
The Geneva Protocol explicitly directed the New Bank to act as the government’s
bank.448 The government undertook to centralise at the Bank of Greece all the receipts and
payments of the state and state enterprises. In addition, the Bank was made responsible for the
‘issue and management of all internal state debt, upon such terms and conditions as may be
agreed upon’.449 Lending to the government, however, was strictly limited. In accordance with
its statutes, the New Bank was allowed to grant credits to the government up to a maximum of
400 million drachmae and to discount treasury bills endorsed by a third party up to a similar
limit.450 Consequently, neither treasury bills nor similar floating debt could total in excess of
800 million drachmae, a sum which corresponded to 3 per cent of the GDP of 1927 or to less
than one-tenth of the 1927 budget which was about 9 billion drachmae. The rate of interest that

could be charged on temporary advances on drachmae was to be agreed between the Bank of
Greece and the government.
Although the Bank of Greece immediately became the government’s bank it was not
designed to be the bank of the banks. No provision was included in its original statutes to
compel commercial banks to place their domestic or foreign reserves with the central bank.
Initially, Henry Strakosch had proposed a clause which was included in the draft statutes that
forced other banks to keep reserves at the central bank.451 According to this clause, every bank
transacting business in Greece would be obliged to maintain a daily minimum balance with the
central bank equal to 7 per cent of its liabilities.452 It is not clear from the material to hand why
this clause was discarded from the final draft statutes of the New Bank. It is quite possible that
in the end a tendency to let the Greeks fight this point out amongst themselves prevailed, since
there was disagreement even amongst the members of the sub-committee about the exact nature
and phrasing of a provision regulating the commercial banks in the country.453 The only bank
that was required by law to ‘maintain daily a minimum balance with the Bank of Greece equal
to 7 per cent of the aggregate sight deposits payable in drachmae’ was the National Bank.454
This stipulation was incorporated in the agreement between the government and the National
Bank of Greece that was drafted at the Bank of England in early July 1927.
The business of the New Bank was limited to discounting bills of three-month maturity
and granting advances for fixed periods not exceeding six months. An exception was given to
agricultural bills and advances which could have a maturity date of nine months.455
The Bank of Greece received statutory independence which was primarily instrument
independence, granting as it did full discretion and power to pursue monetary policy to attain a
goal which was precisely defined. This goal was to ensure the stability of the external value of
the drachma. According to its creators, the strength of the New Bank was based both on its
being statutorily independent and on an endowment of reserves upon commencement of
operations. That having been said, very little concern was expressed if the composition of the

and to play the role of the lender of last resort in order to achieve systemic stability.
7.4. Endowment of the Bank of Greece
The Bank of Greece opened its doors for business on Monday 14 May 1928 as a joint stock
company. Its share capital was 400 million drachmae divided into 80,000 shares of 5,000
drachmae each. In order to safeguard its independence, the statutes of the New Bank stipulated
that the state together with state institutions could not own more than one-tenth of its nominal
issued capital.456 See Table A5.1 in Appendix A5 where the first balance sheet of the Bank of
Greece is presented. This table shows the financial strength of the Bank of Greece upon
commencement of operations.
The share capital of the New Bank was initially taken over by the National Bank, which
was obliged to offer it for public subscription at par in three separate issues: the first within two
months of the opening of the New Bank and the second and third issues each with a year’s
interval between them. A pre-emption right to one-half of each issue was to be reserved for the
shareholders of the National Bank in proportion to the number of shares that they held in the
capital of this bank.457 In return, the National Bank transferred to the Bank of Greece bills and
advances and other liquid assets that the latter was entitled to hold. The total discounts and
advances that were passed on to the Bank of Greece amounted to nearly 50 million drachmae or
0.16 per cent of the GDP of the country in 1927. (See Appendix A5, Table A5.1.) By contrast
the discounts of the National Bank on 14 May 1928, the first day that it operated as a pure
commercial bank, amounted to over a billion drachmae or 3.38 per cent of the 1927 GDP.
The New Bank’s deposits comprised deposits belonging to the government and to the
banking sector. As has been mentioned above, the National Bank was obliged by law to keep
deposits at the Bank of Greece equal to 7 per cent of its aggregate sight deposits payable in
drachmae. Other banks could deposit with the new central bank if they wished.458 On the first
day of the New Bank’s operations almost the entirety of its liabilities in favour of the banking
sector, 95 per cent, belonged to the National Bank and only a small proportion, 5 per cent,
comprised deposits of the other banks.459

According to the Geneva Protocol, the government undertook to centralise at the Bank
of Greece all the receipts and payments of the government and government enterprises.460
However, in violation of the Geneva Protocol, the final agreement between the government and
the National Bank gave the latter the right to retain deposits of the surplus funds of state
enterprises until 1950.461 The literature has seen this arrangement as a gesture on the part of
Greek officials involved in the central banking reform to preserve a strong National Bank.462
The Geneva Protocol stated that the New Bank should have reserves in gold and foreign
exchange of not less than 50 per cent of the total of the note circulation and its other demand
liabilities on the day that it commenced business.463 The balance sheet of 14 May 1928, the day
that the Bank commenced operations, painted an optimistic picture: it showed a reserve ratio of
53.67 per cent of all sight liabilities or 81.51 per cent of the notes in circulation alone.

Table 7.1 illustrates how the government debt that the National Bank possessed before central
banking reform, was distributed between the two banks, the National Bank and the Bank of
Greece. This table also shows what proportion of that debt was cleared by the proceeds of one
third of the Stabilisation Loan. The National Bank transferred to the New Bank the Greek
government bonds denominated in gold that it was obliged to keep as cover for banknotes
issued in conformity with the Laws 656 of 1915 and 2547 of 1920, after deducting gold bonds
forming part of this cover to the value of £700,000.464 According to the Geneva Protocol, the
value of these bonds was to be based on the average price of Greek government bonds traded on
the London Stock Exchange during the three months to 30 September 1927. Their value in
sterling was converted into Greek currency at the stabilisation price.465 This arrangement
transferred to the New Bank Greek government bonds denominated in gold of market value of
£621,409 or 233,028,598.50 drachmae.466 As Table 7.1 shows, these bonds were 0.75 per cent
of GDP in 1927 or 5.84 per cent of the total debt that was transferred to the Bank of Greece.467
They formed part of the reserves of the Bank of Greece as defined by its statutes, representing
7.30 per cent of the total reserves. In fact, it was the only part of the government debt that the
Bank of Greece inherited from its predecessor that was liquid, traded on secondary markets and
could be used for open market operations.
The rest of the government debt that the National Bank passed over to the New Bank
and which appears on its balance sheet of 14 May 1928 under the heading ‘Government Debt’
was immobile, illiquid debt that had its origins in the inflationary period of the 1920s. It
consisted of issues of banknotes for the account of the government, loans resulting from the
ΓΧΜΒ Law and other direct loans of the National Bank to the government after the proceeds
of one-third of the Stabilisation Loan had been deducted.468 (For a detailed presentation of
this illiquid government debt held by the National Bank before the central banking reform,
see Table 4.11 in Chapter 4.) As Table 7.1 illustrates, this debt was more than 12 per cent of
the 1927 GDP of the country and comprised 94.16 per cent of the total government debt that
the Bank of Greece held on the very first day of its operations or 47.41 per cent of its total
assets. In practice, it limited the power of the bank to intervene in the financial market and to
conduct effectively monetary policy. The 3 million sterling of the Stabilisation Loan that was

The Old Bank retained national debt amounting to nearly 4 per cent of the 1927 GDP or nearly
18 per cent of the total public debt that it held before the reform. (See Table 7.1 above.) The
composition of the public debt that remained at the National Bank is illustrated in Table 7.2.
Government debt of nearly 2.50 per cent of GDP comprised Greek government bonds
denominated in gold and in drachmae that were traded on the Athens Stock Exchange. This is a
modest estimate based on the book value of the government bonds that the National Bank
recorded in its annual report.469 Both the discount portfolio of the Old Bank and its portfolio of
government bonds when compared with those of the New Bank gave the former an
unchallenged pre-eminence on the credit market. By contrast, as has been pointed out above, the
instruments that the Bank of Greece wielded were not effective in imposing its authority on the
financial markets and exercising monetary policy. It possessed too few assets which could be
used to inject or drain market liquidity.

CONCLUSION

CONCLUSION
This thesis examines the origins of central banking in Greece and thus contributes to the
literature dealing with the evolution of central banking and its transfer to small open
economies. It also adds to research related to foreign financial intervention and control, and
sends the message that conditionality attached to financial assistance is successfully
implemented if it is in line with the prevailing political economy in the recipient country. A
long time-span is covered, allowing the thesis to demonstrate that conditionality is also
successful as long as the historical and economic circumstances which prevailed when it was
introduced remain unchanged.
Prior to the establishment of a fully fledged central bank in Greece in 1928, the
National Bank, a dual-purpose bank, carried out the public responsibilities of a central bank
whilst at the same time being by far the most important commercial bank. The Old Bank of
issue is considered in this thesis to be a central bank which, however, failed to develop into a
fully fledged central bank as would be recognised today, owing either to market forces or
government intervention, by following a route similar to that described in the natural
evolution hypothesis. When under pressure from the League, the National Bank’s governors
faced the challenge of transforming it into a fully fledged central bank by shedding all
commercial and deposit banking business; they chose instead for the Old Bank to continue with
its commercial activities and to lose all its public responsibilities. A fully fledged central bank,
the Bank of Greece, was then established alongside it. As a result, the social cost of transferring
the commercial activities and deposits of the National Bank to a newly established commercial
bank, or to other banks that already operated in Greece as was initially suggested by the League,
was minimised.
Extensive use of the annual reports and the published balance sheets of the Old Bank of
issue as well as material, both qualitative and quantitative, from a variety of archives enabled
widespread analysis of the ‘dual position’ of the National Bank over a long and historically
diverse period. Time series are constructed to demonstrate how its governors managed ‘the two
conceptions of their business’,470 i.e. central banking responsibilities and commercial banking
preserving and safeguarding the financial strength and consequently the reputation and
credibility of the Bank. A strong, financially sound National Bank created the systemic
470 Clapham (1944, p. 372).
290


stability that characterised the Greek banking system and made it a respectable ambassador
for the Greek government abroad. It is unfortunate that no similar time series have been
created exploring the central banking responsibilities and the commercial activities of the
National Bank from 1842 up to 1897. Future research has the potential to fill this gap by
constructing time series following the methodology adopted here; only then could the entire
history of the Old Bank as a dual-purpose bank be evaluated.
The time series constructed demonstrate the evolution of the dual-purpose Old Bank
between the enactment of the Law of Control in 1898 and the establishment of the Bank of
Greece in 1928. They refer to the commercial activities of the Bank, its financial position, its
relationship with the government and the manner in which the printing press was used. For the
first time ever, and for the purpose of this thesis, public debt as it appeared on the National
Bank’s balance sheet is divided into public debt traded on stock exchanges and government
debt that was not traded on secondary markets, and time series were created accordingly. The
newly constructed time series indicate that the changes a long period of war and monetary
upheaval brought to the structure and composition of the balance sheet of the Old Bank, to a
great extent, determined the banking reforms that took place in the late 1920s.
This thesis demonstrates that the commercial aspect of the National Bank was very
strong on the eve of central banking reforms. The Old Bank was involved in a variety of
commercial activities; most of which were not, however, compatible with central banking
orthodoxy as promoted by the Bank of England. The Old Bank can be compared with other
continental ‘public banks’, which in the past had combined unique public responsibilities with
commercial activities. It differed, however, from those continental banks of issue in that it
remained a dual-purpose bank until as late as the 1920s and never evolved into a fully fledged
central bank. The structure of the assets and liabilities of the Greek bank of issue was close to
the early North European central banking model, where ‘solidity of collateral’ was more
important than the liquidity dictated by the classical model of central banking.471
The time series constructed demonstrate that at the beginning of the period in question
the commercial activities of the National Bank were primarily focused on mortgage credit and
time deposits. Illiquid public debt held by the Bank consisted mainly of forced banknotes in
circulation between the enactment of the Law of Control and the outbreak of the Balkan Wars.
The newly created time series indicate that during this period of relative peace and growth the
Old Bank of issue expanded credits to the economy and its deposits increased. They also show
471 Tarkka (2009).
291


that the Bank began restructuring its portfolio of credits to the economy in favour of more liquid
forms, just after the outbreak of the First World War. It is important to note that the significance
of mortgage credit as an asset item of the Old Bank had diminished by 1926 in favour of more
liquid assets, following a long period of war and high inflation. In addition, time deposits
decreased during that same period. This change on the Bank’s balance sheet explains in a way
that goes beyond what is argued in the literature why, of its own volition, it conceded its
mortgage credit privilege to the newly established Mortgage Bank in 1927.
The same newly constructed time series show that the commercial aspect of the
National Bank subsided after the outbreak of the Great War and in addition graphically indicate
that the relationship between credits supplied to the economy and bilateral public debt held by
the National Bank changed fundamentally after 1918. As is evidenced, the Old Bank proved
to be the main source of financial support to the government during a turbulent historical
period when the latter had no access to international financial markets and a complex
relationship developed between them. High inflation in the 1920s wiped out a significant part
of the nominal value of bilateral public debt denominated in drachmae and owned by the
National Bank without, however, entirely eliminating it. Hence, the National Bank promoted
a stabilisation programme which would help to reduce it still further so as to increase its
liquidity.
The financial position of the dual-purpose Old Bank was also protected by the way in
which it pursued its commercial activities. The National Bank’s financial strength was based
on its ability to select high quality assets and liabilities, which resulted in its enduring
profitability and solvency. In this thesis, the term profitability does not necessarily mean that
the aim of its management was the maximisation of profits, despite the fact that the National
Bank was a private institution. The quality of its assets and liabilities, given the constraints
under which it operated, was more important for its conservative and risk-averse governors
than maximisation of profits per se in the conventional sense of the term. A great number of
the assets and liabilities of the Old Bank related to the monopolies and privileges that it
enjoyed. Furthermore, as is shown, there was a considerable spread between the interest rate
charged for credits to the economy and the rate paid for deposits, which also indicates that the
banking system in Greece was not at all competitive.
The policy of the National Bank as a commercial bank was to lend against a variety
of good collateral, to low-risk, creditworthy customers from its establishment in 1842 to the
end of the period in question. A conservative and risk-averse National Bank did not challenge
the informal credit networks that operated but did business with them, as they could provide
292


high quality collateral and were the low-risk and creditworthy customers it sought. Research,
however, on the relationship between the banking sector and the non-banking credit system is
very limited. The literature has not so far tackled crucial questions related, for example, to the
National Bank and the cost of capital in Greece.
This thesis demonstrates that it was the way in which the governors of the National
Bank combined central banking responsibilities with commercial banking that safeguarded
and preserved the financial strength and consequently the reputation and authority of the
Bank. As a bank of the government the Old Bank lent to the government, though reluctantly,
during periods of national crisis. When attempts at reconstruction were made, the aim of the
Old Bank was to achieve a reduction and/or a reconstruction of the illiquid public debt that it
held. A financially sound National Bank in turn acted as an anchor in an unstable political,
economic and monetary environment, such as that of the period in question. Although it
protected its own interests at the same time, a financially sound National Bank provided the
systemic stability that characterised the Greek banking system and made it a respectable and
credible ambassador for the Greek government abroad.
As is shown, restructuring of the domestic public debt in 1898 strengthened the
financial position of the Old Bank of issue. In the late 1920s, the National Bank pursued a
stabilisation programme that would improve its liquidity and its position as the bank of the
government, whilst allowing it to expand its commercial aspect, as stabilisation was expected
to encourage foreign direct investment in Greece. William Miller (1928, pp. 20–21), an
experienced observer of Greek affairs, wrote that on the eve of the central banking reform
the terrace of the Grande Bretagne in Athens [was] often full of business men in search of concessions. The drainage of the Vardar and Struma valleys, the Salonika harbour-works, the new port of Candia, the ‘Power and Traction’ convention for the traffic of Athens and suburbs, railways, telegraphic and aerial communications, water-works, and roads – all
these have attracted foreigners.472
The National Bank would not have implemented such radical reforms of its own
volition. Neither were key market forces conducive to such sweeping central banking reforms
in the late 1920s. The structure and the size of the banking sector as well as the payments
system, in short, the stage of development of financial institutions in Greece at the time,
would not have encouraged the Old Bank to confine its activities to central banking
orthodoxy. By the time the Greek delegation arrived in Geneva in June 1927 to request
officially the assistance of the League in stabilising de jure the drachma, the National Bank
had already conceded its monopoly on mortgage credit, of its own accord, to a newly
472 Quoted also in Mazower (1991, p. 107).
293


established National Mortgage Bank. This was the only monopoly that the bank of issue had
enjoyed since its foundation in 1842 but which it willingly passed to another banking
institution in the late 1920s. Then in 1928 the Old Bank conceded its issuing privilege to the
Bank of Greece; and finally in 1930 it lost its monopoly on agricultural credit when a
specialised institution, the Agricultural Bank of Greece, commenced operations. These wide
ranging banking reforms led to the modernisation and rationalisation of the banking system in
Greece and together constitute the most important transformation of the banking system in the
country in its entire history.
This thesis also examines the monetary arrangement introduced in March 1910,
which is known as the ΓΧΜΒ Law or the Valaorites Law, and draws attention to the
discrepancy between the way that this monetary change in Greece in 1910 is seen in recent
economic history literature and the way it was considered by scholars and policy makers at
the time. These days it is claimed that Greece adopted either the gold standard or the gold
exchange standard during that month. By contrast, before the 1980s it was believed that the
Greek currency had remained inconvertible throughout the period from September 1885,
when the gold standard was suspended, until May 1928, when the gold exchange standard
was de jure introduced. A close analysis, however, of the ΓΧΜΒ Law indicates that in 1910
the National Bank, a privately owned bank of issue, aimed at avoiding the ‘golden fetters’.
Thus, a mechanism was introduced that helped the Old Bank to maintain a stable drachma at
its LMU parity, whilst at the same time increasing the money supply for the ‘needs of trade’.
Simultaneously, the ΓΧΜΒ Law helped the Bank to increase its reserves in gold and foreign
exchange, which, as is shown, became an important source of income for the bank of issue.
The fact that the National Bank was reluctant to adopt the gold standard raises questions that
are at the heart of the ‘rules versus discretion’ debate. Does the 1910 monetary arrangement in
Greece reflect the inherent tension between a privately owned central bank’s duty to earn
profits for its shareholders and its responsibility to provide the public with monetary and
financial stability? To what extent did the ΓΧΜΒ Law enacted in March 1910 and its
evolution reflect the political economy of the time and historical circumstances? Only future
research can provide conclusive answers to these questions.
It has been argued that the emergence of early central banks stemmed from the needs of
‘revenue seeking or power-hungry governments’473 to ‘finance [public expenditure] on
beneficial, subsidised terms’474. Once again state finance was at the core of central banking
reforms under the terms of the stabilisation programmes sponsored by the Financial Committee
473 Bordo and Redish (1987, p. 405).

of the League of Nations. This time, however, central banking reforms were aimed at preventing
governments from borrowing liberally from the central bank and making monetary policy
subordinate to fiscal policy. Central banking reforms in the 1920s also aimed to re-establish the
pre-war status quo and encourage cooperation among central bankers.
The statutes of the Bank of Greece were at the heart of the stabilisation principles and
were focused both on the macro function of a central bank and on its role as the bank of the
government. The law of the New Bank set up a commitment mechanism for monetary policy
and central bank independence. The law alone, however, is insufficient to guarantee
independence for any central bank. Central banks also need to achieve a political consensus, or
at least a sufficient degree of political support, to maintain their position of independence.475 In
Greece, the establishment of a central bank was not welcomed either by politicians or by the
commercial banks. Its independence, a keystone in its statutes, was limited from its earliest
days. And in the final analysis the credibility of the Bank of Greece was contingent upon events
that its creators were not able to predict even as late as 1928.
Central banking reforms that took place under the supervision of the Financial
Committee of the League of Nations in the 1920s were aimed at combating different economic
and monetary conditions from those that emerged in the 1930s. In the 1930s, central banks had
to operate in an environment dominated by the failure of the gold exchange standard, by
collapsing financial structures, extensive state intervention and autarky. The actions of the Bank
of Greece became effective under the distinctive conditions that were created by the financial
crisis of 1931. These conditions, coupled with the fact that depreciation and flexible exchange
rates enabled policy makers to pursue monetary policies independent of the exchange rate,
strengthened the position of the newly established central bank in Greece. More research,
however, must be carried out to delineate the monetary policy that the Bank of Greece exercised
in the 1930s and the effect that this policy had on enabling the Bank of Greece to strengthen its
position in the market place.
This thesis also explores the complex relationship that arose between Greek
governments and foreign supervisors and unravels the impact that foreign financial
intervention had on the evolution of monetary institutions in Greece during the period in
question.
Sovereign risk time series were constructed to establish the background of the
negotiating power of the Greek government between the introduction of the Law of Control in
1898 and stabilisation in 1928. These sovereign risk time series illustrate in a graphic way
475 Goodhart (1993, p. 6).

why Greek governments faced considerable difficulties in raising capital on the financial
markets in the 1920s, beyond the international politics and embargoes referred to in the
literature. Qualitative research into the British press supports the findings of quantitative
analysis which indicates that creditors acted upon news of fiscal policy and public debt.476
This thesis examines in depth the Geneva Protocol of 1927 prepared by the Financial
Committee of the League and refers extensively to the 1898 Law of Control. The parallels and
contrasts between them are explored as the international financial control of the late
nineteenth century is echoed in the League reconstruction schemes. In the late 1890s, the
central issue in the negotiations was the resumption of the debt service of the external public
debt. The Law of Control detailed the restructuring of the Greek government debt and
encouraged monetary discipline in Greece and independence for the National Bank. It should
be noted that the Law of Control did not stipulate that Greece had to adopt the gold standard
as is usually claimed by modern scholars. By contrast, a prerequisite of the 1927 League
Reconstruction scheme was de jure adoption of the gold exchange standard.
In both 1898 and 1928 conditionality was introduced that was pertinent to the
operation of the National Bank; in fact, as is shown, conditionality protected its financial
strength since on both occasions it improved the quality of its assets. In particular, the
bilateral public debt that it held was restructured in 1898, whilst in 1928 the National Bank
refused to confine its assets and liabilities to those of a central bank and passed over to the
Bank of Greece nearly all the illiquid debt that it held. This thesis also demonstrates that
reforms relating to monetary institutions encouraged by foreign creditors were adapted in
such a way as to be in line with the objectives and the constraints under which the Old Bank
of issue operated when still a privately owned central bank. For example, in 1898
conditionality introduced by the Law of Control relating to monetary institutions had been
endorsed, if not promoted, by the National Bank. Yet again, in 1928, the National Bank
sponsored a stabilisation programme which safeguarded and preserved its own financial
position and strength.
In the 1920s, the League facilitated access to capital markets by signalling that a
country, in this case Greece, would follow prudent fiscal and monetary policies in the future.
The coupon rate of the League loans was close to the market yield of the country that floated
the loan. In this way the creditworthiness of the country in question was denoted. By contrast,
in 1898 the Great Powers jointly and severally guaranteed the flotation of the 2.50 per cent
476 See Christodoulaki et al. (2011, 2012).
296


Guaranteed Loan. As a result, the terms under which the Guaranteed Loan was issued were
very favourable; in fact, its interest rate was only 2.50 per cent, that is to say the same as the
British consols coupon rate.
In the both late 1890s and late 1920s, lenders to Greece promoted the establishment
of institutions there that were akin to those which prevailed in their own countries. By the
time that the 1898 Law of Control and the 1928 League stabilisation programme were signed,
conditionality had not only been accepted but, as discussed, also shaped by those that were
most affected. Since 2009, when the current economic recession started, successive Greek
governments have faced similar questions to those that are tackled extensively here in this
thesis. An over-borrowed Greek government has had no access to capital markets and has
been expected to implement widespread structural reforms demanded by its lenders, which,
however, have mustered very little support. Resistance and delays in the implementation of
structural reforms in a fairly unstable and polarised political environment are among the most
important reasons for a deep and protracted economic recession. A ‘war of attrition’ with
distributional implications among different socio-economic groups has taken place and the
burden of a huge and rapid fiscal adjustment has been shifted onto those that can bear it least
and to future generations.

Notes:
(1) Deposits of the government are in gold and nominal drachmae. (2) In 1927 the way that data were presented on the balance sheet changed. Three categories of deposits appear: sight, time and savings deposits. Government deposits were most likely included in sight deposits. In the Annual Report of the National Bank for 1927, p. XIV the governor reported data on deposits of other agencies. Thus, using these data on deposits of other agencies it can be assumed that in 1927 government deposits were 1,366,090 and deposits of other agencies 3,072,444,606. Government deposits for 1927, however, seem to be an outlier. Note that in June 1927 the National Bank handed over to the Mortgage Bank a significant part of its time deposits.
