THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING VIGILANT:
HAS ECB COMMUNICATION INFLUENCED
EURO AREA INFLATION EXPECTATIONS?
Abstract
Using daily data on inflation-indexed bonds, we find evidence of a negative relationship between ECB communication regarding risks to price stability - measured on the basis of the frequency and strength of the keyword ‘vigilance’ - and changes in euro area break-even inflation. However, this result is only found for the second half of 2005. At that time, the start of a tightening of ECB monetary policy was increasingly likely. This suggests that communication should be closely in line with policy actions before it can be effective. Still, we also find that the economic significance of this type of communication has been small.

1 Introduction
Expectations are key for macroeconomic developments. The importance of this
insight is widely recognized by central banks. For example, the European Cen
tral Bank (ECB) recently wrote: ‘Stabilising the private sector’s inflation ex
pectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to be able efficiently to achieve
the objective of price stability.’ ECB (2006) (p.59). The determinants of ex
pectations are less well understood. This paper investigates whether it is pos
sible for central banks to influence private sector expectations through commu
nication.
There is, by now, compelling evidence that central bank communication af
fects developments in financial markets. Ehrmann and Fratzscher (2007), for
instance, find that communications by the Federal Reserve, the ECB, and the
Bank of England have been an important driver of financial markets. This
suggests that communication affects, in some way, the expectations of private
agents. However, their is still little direct on the effects of communication on
expectations. Therefore, this paper uses the concept of break-even inflation
to measure the impact of central bank communication on private sector ex
pectations.
In particular, we study the relationship between euro area inflation ex
pectations and ECB communications regarding risks to price stability in recent
years. This sample period is particularly interesting as it contains two distinct
episodes. Between June 2003 and December 2005, the ECB maintained its main
refinancing rate at a level of 2%. However, during this period inflation worries
frequently arose. For example, inflation expectations as derived from inflation
indexed bonds showed sharp increases at times. This has lead the ECB to voice
its concerns by signalling that it was ‘vigilant’ regarding upward risks to price
1


stability. As ‘vigilance’ is a clear keyword to communicate concerns to financial
markets, we use its occurrence to identify the effects of communication on infla
tion expectations.1 From Autumn-2005 onwards, markets observers regarded a
change in the ECB’s policy stance increasingly likely given the incoming macro
economic data.2 As it thus became more likely that words would be followed
by deed, the effects of the ECB’s communications may have been different than
earlier during this period. Finally, from December 2005 onwards, the ECB has
raised the main refinancing rate a number of times. Interestingly, the keyword
‘vigilance’ continued to be used in ECB communication. It was, however, used
less frequently. Also, its interpretation has changed. It can still be seen as an
indication of the ECB’s unease regarding risks to price stability, but it is also
strongly perceived by market participants as an indicator of upcoming policy
changes.3 This raises the question of whether this type of ECB communication
has had similar effects on inflation expectations in this period as in the period
2003 - 2005.
Our key finding is that the relationship between the ECB’s signalling of
inflation risks (through the use of ‘vigilance’) and euro area break-even inflation
has been varying over time. We only find evidence for a significant relationship
between communication and changes in break-even inflation during October
and November 2005. This suggests that communication should be closely in
line with policy actions before it can be effective. Still, we also find that the
economic significance of this type of communication has been small.
The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses the
relationship between central bank communication and inflation expectations.
1ECB president Trichet (2005) has noted: ‘Our concern ..... was signalled to the market
from autumn 2003 in the press conference. Over time, our communication became increasingly
‘alert’, signalling our vigilance to the upside risks to inflation which grew at the time.’ 2For instance, the Consensus survey on 14 November indicated that almost 40% of the
respondents expected a rate increase within 30 days. 3According to Bloomberg, ‘ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet has used the word “vig
ilant” to flag each of the six rate increases since late 2005’ (Bloomberg News, 15 February
2007). Likewise, according to UBS: ‘Trichet has made a practice of effectively pre-announcing
hikes at the prior meeting with the use of the key ”vigilant” phrase’ (UBS FX Trade and
Research, 9 January 2007).

Section 3 outlines how we obtained data on communication and inflation ex
pectations, while section 4 shortly describes this data. Section 5 presents our
empirical model, while section 6 shows the estimation results. Section 7 consid
ers the robustness of our findings. Finally, section 8 offers our conclusions.
2 Communication and inflation expectations
Why is influencing private sector expectations useful from the perspective of
the central bank? It is important to realize that the control of the central bank
over its ultimate goals, be it solely price stability or also output stabilization,
is very indirect. Most central banks try to influence economic developments by
changing borrowing conditions at the short end of the yield curve. Changes in
the policy rate then feed through into long-term interest rates, exchange rates,
asset prices and credit conditions, thus influencing, in the end, spending and
pricing decisions of private agents. However, it is not only the current policy
stance, but also the expected path of future interest rates that matters for
decisions of private agents. This expected path is crucially dependent on the
outlook for price developments and economic growth. Therefore, this opens the
possibility for central banks to affect current decisions by steering expectations
for these variables through communication.4
At the same time, it is possible to argue, from a theoretical perspective, that
communication has no value added with respect to expectations. If the central
bank has committed to a policy rule, if there are no information asymmetries,
and if economic agents have rational expectations, the private sector would be
able to infer the systemic part of policy from the central bank’s actions, thus
rendering communication superfluous (see also Woodford (2006)). From a prac
tical point of view, however, these conditions may be questioned. Interest rate
decision-making is often highly discretionary, information asymmetries between
4See also Blinder, Goodhart, Hildebrand, Lipton and Wyplosz (2001) or Woodford (2006).
Theoretically, Morris and Shin (2002) have argued that more public information is not neces
sarily welfare-enhancing. Svensson (2006) has argued that this result holds only in very special
circumstances, which makes it empirically less relevant.
3


the central bank and the private sector exist when central banks are less than
perfectly transparent, and empirical evidence on inflation expectations has often
been in conflict with the rational expectations hypothesis. Moreover, as noted,
empirical evidence strongly suggests that central bank communications affect
developments in financial markets.5
With respect to central bank communication on inflation, a distinction should
be made between i) the announcement of a target for inflation and ii) commu
nication on inflationary developments. Nowadays, many central banks have
publicly announced a target for inflation. In the case of the ECB, this target is
specified as a year-on-year change in euro area HICP inflation below, but close
to 2%. In general, if the public perceives the central bank as credible, long-run
inflation expectations would be anchored around this target. Transitory shocks
may cause inflation to differ from this target, but should not necessarily af
fect long-run expectations. G ̈urkaynak, Levin, and Swanson (2006) find, in this
context, that a well-known and credible inflation target can help in anchoring
private sector views regarding long-run inflation outcomes.6
How could the central bank then gain from regularly publishing its views
on expected economic developments, notably future inflation? First, clear and
consistent communication may contribute to building reputation, in particular
if the track-record of the central bank concerned is short. Second, the cen
tral bank can use communication in a situation in which inflation expectations
deviate from target. Communication explaining the deviation and perhaps sug
gesting possible policy reactions could guide expectations back to target. If
agents perceive the comments as new information, they accordingly adjust their
expectations, which would be reflected in market prices. Given the develop
ments over the sample period in this study, the latter mechanism is particularly
relevant.
5See Eijffinger and Geraats (2006) for recent evidence on central bank trans
parency. Mankiw, Reis, and Wolfers (2004) and Conlisk (1996) discuss rationality in survey
data of inflation expectations. 6 Eusepi and Preston (2007) argue that announcing the inflation target is not enough
for expectations stabilization: the central bank must also announce the associated values for
nominal interest rates and the output gap.

3 Measuring communication and inflation ex
pectations
Financial markets are continuously flooded with information. It seems likely
that analysts and traders employ filtering mechanisms to process the incoming
data.7 Central banks may, in turn, revert to a strategy of using keywords and key
phrases in their communication. In this paper, we focus on the use of ‘vigilance’,
‘vigilant’ or variations thereof as an indicator of the ECB’s perception of risks
to price stability.8
The ECB uses four main communication instruments. Firstly, there are the
press conferences given by the ECB president and vice-president after meetings
of the ECB’s Governing Council. A second instrument is the publication of the
Monthly Bulletin of which in particular the editorial is scrutinised by analysts.
A third instrument are the testimonial hearings by the ECB president (or vice
president) at the European Parliament. Finally, Governing Council members
often present their views in speeches and interviews. To search for the occurrence
of ‘vigilance’ in communication, we use two main data sources: Bloomberg and
the ECB web-site. For the period between 2 June 2003 and 30 November 2005,
we searched the archive of Bloomberg News for ECB communications, yielding
a comprehensive data-set of over 2,000 news reports. For the period starting in
December 2005 we used the ECB web-site. In this latter case, we include i).
the ECB press conference, ii). the editorial of the ECB Monthly Bulletin, iii).
speeches by Trichet and Papademos.
Table 1 reports the list of people and keywords that were included in the
Bloomberg search. We included news reports if i). the comment referred to
7Mervyn King (2005), for instance, suggests how the public could use rules-of-thumb:‘we
do not know whether - and, if so, to what extent - people use heuristics to make real economic
decisions. But a central bank should be alert to the possibility of their doing so.’ (p. 12). 8There may be an issue of reverse causality, as the ECB’s communications may be a
reaction to developments in (expected) inflation. However, our identification strategy is based
on daily data. Although the ECB may very well use ‘vigilance’ in reaction to a series of
upward changes in (expected) inflation, it is less likely that each and every positive change in
break-even inflation will entice the ECB to mention ‘vigilance’.

euro area (as opposed to national) economic conditions, ii). concerned economic
issues as specified in the second column of table 1, and iii). contained new infor
mation. This latter point implies that updates of news reports are only included
as far as they contain more detailed comments or comments on new issues. To
analyse this data, we performed keyword in context (KWIC) searches for occur
rences of the words ‘vigilance’ and ‘vigilant’.9 These KWIC searches generated
several useful pieces of information. Apart from knowing who made the com
ments, and when, we also recorded how the term ‘vigilance’ was used. For
example, some comments used ‘vigilance’, while others used the terms ‘strong
vigilance’ or ‘very strong vigilance’. We will further investigate the effects of
these different formulations in section 5. The KWIC searches also reported the
topics to which ‘vigilance’ referred. We will return to this information as part
of our robustness checks in section 7.
Research on inflation expectations has so far mainly relied on survey data.
For our purposes, inflation-indexed bonds are more suited as data is available
on a daily basis.10 This is useful in estimating the high-frequency impact of
communication. At the moment, few countries have issued bonds linked to euro
area inflation which, as a consequence, somewhat limits us in our analysis. This
paper uses data on the OATei instrument: a French inflation-indexed bond,
first issued by the Agency France Tr ́esor (AFT) in November 2001. The OATei
instrument is linked to the euro area HICP index (exclusive of tobacco prices)
and is best suited for our purposes as it is the longest time-series available.
We downloaded yields for the OATei 2012 series and the regular OAT 2012
from the AFT web-site (www.aft.gouv.fr). The difference in the yield of the
OAT and OATei, the so-called break-even inflation, is often used as a proxy for
medium-term inflation expectations.
However, some caution is needed in using break-even inflation. The main
9We have used the computer program WordStat Version 5.0. This program has been
developed by Provalis Research as an add-on feature of the statistical program SimStat. For
more information, see www.provalisresearch.com. 10The key characteristic of inflation-indexed bond is that, over time, the principal value and
the coupon payments are adjusted on the basis of a measure of inflation. Cukierman (1977)
is one of the earliest contributions using inflation-indexed bonds.
7


reason is that break-even inflation may also pick up other factors than expected
inflation, in particular a liquidity and an inflation risk premium. This is illus
trated by the following two equations:
it = rt + πte + ρt (1)
iitnd = rt + λt (2)
where i denotes the yield on a conventional bond, iind denotes the yield on an
indexed bond, r denotes the real interest rate, πe denotes expected inflation,
ρ denotes an inflation risk premium and λ denotes a liquidity premium. As
noted, inflation-indexed bonds were only recently introduced in the euro area.
Investors may have demanded a liquidity premium for holding these bonds, to
compensate for their relative illiquidity. Secondly, investors may require a risk
compensation for holding conventional bonds as actual inflation may differ from
expected inflation.11 Subtracting (2) from (1) shows that break-even inflation
in this case equals:
BEI = πte + ρt − λt (3)
Initially, a liquidity premium may well have been an important component
in break-even inflation. However, turnover in the markets for the OATei 2012
security has strongly increased since 2001. The instrument has by now estab
lished itself and the AFT has since then successfully introduced other issues of
the OATei instrument. For the US, Sack (2000) finds that most of the bias in
break-even inflation can be attributed to the liquidity premium. He also reports
that changes in break-even inflation and ‘corrected’ measures of break-even in
flation are highly correlated.
Greater clarity regarding future monetary policy could reduce the uncer
tainty regarding future levels of inflation and therefore reduce the inflation risk
11Two other factors affecting break-even inflation are differences in duration (due to differ
ences in the payment structure) and declining time to maturity. Recently, the ECB (2006)
investigated the effects of these issues for French inflation-indexed bonds and concluded that
‘break-even inflation rates .. seem to be rather good approximations of the preferable zero
coupon constant maturity measures and are little biased by potential distortions due to du
ration mismatching (p. 31).’ See also Sack (2000) or Kwan (2005) for a discussion of these
issues.

premium. This would be reflected in a lower level of break-even inflation. How
ever, H ̈ordahl and Tristani (2007) find that, on average, the inflation risk pre
mium calculated using OATei data has not differed significantly from zero over
the EMU sample.
4 Data description
Figure 1 shows ten-year euro area break-even inflation (solid line) and the oc
currence of vigilance (the grey diamonds) between June 2003 and March 2007.
The dotted line denotes the ECB’s main refinancing rate. There are steep up
ward movements in expected inflation in late 2003 and early 2004. Starting in
March 2004, the term ’vigilance’ is used extensively in communication. After
December 2005, the term is used less often. To be precise, it occurs only six
teen times in communication. This decline would be in line with the different
interpretation of this keyword after 2005.

In comparison, table 2 shows that between March 2004 and November 2005
vigilance was used some 200 times. The second column shows that in 58 cases,
‘vigilance‘ was mentioned without any further qualification. In about a quarter
of the cases, the term ‘strong vigilance’ was used. Qualifications with probable
high impact, such as ‘very strong vigilance’ or ‘extremely vigilant’ are seldom
used. We will examine the effects of these differences in qualifications in the
remainder of this paper. To this end, the third and fourth column of table 2 show
two classifications of ‘vigilance’. Column 3 outlines an a priori classification of
our reading of ECB code words. The scale is between 1 and 4, where the scale
is increasing in the intensity of the terminology. The scale ranges from the
occurrences of ‘vigilance’ (value 1) through to the transition to ‘more vigilance’
(value 2) to phases with ‘high’ (value 3) or ‘very high vigilance’ (value 4) or
equivalents of these four cases. The last column presents a scale that ex post
aims to capture the news component in ECB communication by measuring
observations according to the inverse of their relative occurrence. If a particular
term is often used in communication, its occurrence may not be considered as
news anymore. In contrast, if a term is used that has never been used before,
markets will probably react strongly to its occurrence.
5 Empirical model
In the spirit of the ‘news approach’, we model daily changes in break-even infla
tion as a linear function of lagged dependents, a dummy variable that measures
the occurrence of ‘vigilance’ and a set of control variables.12 As we find evidence
of clustered volatility we use a GARCH model. We estimate this model using a
normal distribution or, alternatively, a t-distribution in cases where the Jarque
Bera statistic rejected normality in the residuals. Our baseline regression model
12Another motivation for looking at changes rather than levels is that unit root tests could
not conclusively dismiss the hypothesis that break-even inflation is an I(1) series.

Bloomberg surveys. We include variables for the euro area, France and Ger

such as oil futures, stock market indices, the dollar/euro exchange rate and US
T-bills and T-bonds. We use lagged values to circumvent endogeneity problems.
These series are taken from Datastream.13
6 Results
Table 4 shows estimation results for a number of specifications. Column 1
shows a baseline estimation for the period 2 June 2003 to 9 March 2007. On the
basis of the Akaike information criterion, the model is specified as an AR(1)
GARCH(1,1) without a constant and trend term. Inflation expectations react
to news on prices and the IFO indicator, and oil futures. Next, we focus on the
period between 2003 and 2005 when ‘vigilance’ was most actively used. Columns
2 to 4 show three estimation results which include measures of ‘vigilance’. In
all three cases, the coefficient related to vigilance is negative. Column 2 shows

meetings and FOMC meetings and decisions. This did not lead to any qualitative changes in
our conclusions.

the results if we use a dummy variable which has the value 1 when ‘vigilance’
is used in communication, and the value 0 otherwise. The conditional effect
of using ‘vigilance’ is a decline of inflation expectations by a fifth of a basis
point (0.0021). The coefficient is, however, only significant at the 10% level
(p = 0.08). The results for the two alternative classifications are presented in
columns 3 and 4. Using the classification based on our keyword scale, we find a
coefficient for the effect of ’vigilance’ equal to -0.001%. This coefficient is also
significantly different from zero at the 10% level (p= 0.07). For the model using
the second classification, based on the news value of a statement, we find that
the coefficient for the ‘vigilance’ variable is strongly significant (p=0.01).
However, as discussed in section 1, the period between June 2003 and Novem
ber 2005 was not a homogenous period. From Autumn-2005 onwards, it was
increasingly considered likely that the ECB would start to tighten monetary
policy. Incoming macroeconomic data suggested and ECB communication sig
nalled a change in the policy stance.14 We therefore investigate whether the
effects of communication were different in this period by estimating rolling
window regressions for the model in (4) and (5) using the (0,1) ‘vigilance’
dummy. Each window includes 180 days. We start on 1 March 2004, so that the
end-point of the first sample is 5 November 2004. The last estimation sample
ends at 30 November 2005. The estimated coefficient βv in each of these re
gressions is shown in figure 2. Diamonds are used to denote that the coefficient
is significantly different from zero at the 5% level. Figure 2 clearly shows that
timing is important for the results. Initially, the estimated βv is not signifi
cantly different from zero. Once the estimation window includes the months of
October and November 2005 the coefficient is significant. The estimated effects
of vigilance range roughly between 0.0035% and 0.0045%. We conclude that
14For example, during the press conference on 1 September 2005, the wording was changed
from ‘ongoing vigilance’ to ‘particular vigilance’, followed by ‘strong vigilance’ at the October
and November press conferences. According to Consensus Forecast, in September only 4.9%
of the respondents expected a rate increase in the next 30 days. In October, this figure was
up to 11.3% and in November it was up to 37.4%, the highest number in 2.5 years.

the effectiveness of communication with respect to influencing expectations is
strongly related to the perception of upcoming changes in the monetary policy
stance.

This figure shows the estimated βv using 180 days moving windows. The dates are de

the 5% level.
This raises an interesting issue: did this type of ECB communication con
tinue to have these effects on expectations during the period when the ECB
continued to tighten monetary policy in 2006 and 2007? The answer is ‘no’, as
can be seen in the last column of table 4. The coefficient βv is negative, but
not significantly different from zero (p=0.71).15 One reason for this result has
already suggested itself: ‘vigilance’ was used less frequently, making it harder
15For this analysis, we have also performed rolling-window regressions. The coefficient for
16


to pick up any effect in the estimation. But, the absence of reactions in ex
pectations also suggests that communication may be most effective in shaping
expectations at the turning-points in monetary policy, in this case, the start of
tightening after a prolonged period of constant policy rates.
7 Robustness
We have argued that occurrences of ‘vigilance’ are an adequate representation
of the ECB’s assessment of risks to price stability. By focusing on this single
concept, we may be missing important elements of ECB communication. Per
haps ECB communication has contained other signals that markets have reacted
to. These signals would not be incorporated in our ‘vigilance’ measure which
could lead to biased estimates. To study this, we first assess whether the use
of ‘vigilance’ in ECB communications was related to inflationary developments.
Between June 2003 and November 2005, when ‘vigilance’ most often occurred,
it was used in connection with 21 different topics. On 46 occasions, ‘vigilance’
did not explicitly refer to a certain topic. Out of 197 occurrences of the topics,
‘vigilance’ referred to ‘risks to price stability’ 48 times. Other topics that were
often mentioned were ‘inflation expectations’ (24 times), ‘2nd round effects’ (23
times), ‘oil prices’ (22 times), ‘inflation’ (21 times), ‘M3’ (17 times) and ‘infla
tion risks’ (8 times). In all, this analysis supports our use of ‘vigilance’ as a
signal of risks to price stability.
We also tested for the effects of ECB communications when ‘vigilance’ is not
used. To this end, we include in our baseline regression a variable that is equal to
one if the ECB communicated on a particular day without using ‘vigilance’ and
equal to zero otherwise. The result for the 2003 - 2005 sample is shown in column
1 of table 5. We find that the absence of ‘vigilance’ in ECB communication
actually coincided with higher levels of break-even inflation. Further evidence
is provided in figure 3. When incorporating the second half of 2005 in the
the ‘vigilance’ variable was in no case significant. Results available upon request from the
corresponding author.

estimation, we find evidence of a conditional impact of close to a half basis point.
At the same time, there is evidence of a negative reaction earlier in 2005. It is
possible, therefore, that other aspects of communication have been important.
Nevertheless, the effects in this case are less marked. On balance, the focus
on ‘vigilance’ seems justified. Another robustness test is to see what happens
when the ECB does not communicate at all. Perhaps inflation expectations
would have decreased regardless of whether communication took place. In that
case, we would wrongly attribute the negative change in expectations to central
bank communication. However, as column 2 of table 5 shows, this is not the
case. Between 2003 and 2005, changes in break-even inflation on days without
communication were slightly positive.16

Finally, so far we have not addressed the fact that the OATei2012 security
has been off-the-run since the OATei2015 series was issued in November 2004.
Therefore, we also estimated rolling-window regressions using break-even infla
tion derived from the OATei2015 and the OAT2014 series. As figure 4 shows,
the results are very similar to those for the OATei2012 series.

8 Conclusions
Our key finding is that the ECB’s signalling of discomfort with inflationary
developments through communication has had a negative relationship with
changes in euro area break-even inflation even during a period when the in
terest rate instrument was not used. However, this type of communication has
only led to responses in financial markets when it closely coincided with the
perception of upcoming changes in the ECB’s monetary policy stance. Even
more so, the effects are found at the start of a tightening phase, but not during
this period. Despite its statistical significance, the economic significance of this
type of communication has been small.
There are a number of questions that future research may address. To start
with, it may be worthwhile to investigate this issue at lower frequencies. Perhaps
a series of comments may have a stronger impact on expectations than isolated
statements. It would also be interesting to investigate the high-frequency re
lationship between communications and inflation expectations for a number of
other central banks, such as the Bank of England or the Federal Reserve. Fi
nally, it would be instructive to further explore the possibility of a connection
between communication and the different components of break-even inflation.
