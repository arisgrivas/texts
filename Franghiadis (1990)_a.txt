Introduction
a. The peasantry in recent Greek historiography.
The views of Greek historians on the conditions of
existence and the strategy of peasant families tend to
converge around a set of assumptions that may be depicted as
following:
- The peasantry held virtual control over large part of
the land it cultivated. A great part of this land
consisted of "National Estates" - that is, of land which
before 1830 belonged to the Porte and to Ottoman subjects
and after that date became property of the Greek state.
Until 1871, any individual, as well as peasant families,
might occupy and cultivate part of this land, by paying
a relatively low rent, proportional to gross output, as
a "right of usufruct" to the Treasury. Although the legal
framework was unclear and liable to changes, regular
occupants of this land might sell, rent, give as a dowry
or even mortgage their rights on it. Thus, rights of
occupancy on national land were de facto almost as strong
as rights of property. 1
-Ownership of large estates represented an exceptional and

rather marginal situation; the wealthy and powerful strata
of the population were mainly oriented towards commerce,
money-lending, political and administrative careers, and
showed a relative indifference towards the prospect of
acquisition and exploitation of agricultural estate
property. 2
-The massive sale of "National Estates", organized
according to the law of 1871, which gave priority to long
standing occupants, permitted a further consolidation of
the peasants' position. It is commonly held that long
standing occupants became full proprietors of the land
they traditionally cultivated. 3
-Peasant farms, which represented the prevalent type of
productive unit in Greek agriculture, were "target
producers" oriented towards subsistence. This they sought
through a varying combination of activities, including
production of foodstuffs for home consumption, occasional
wage-labour, and highly commercialized crops, such as
currant viticulture, growing of cotton or tobacco. 4 These
latter were a supplementary opportunity for further

differentiation of activities differentiation which
contributed to the security of household income5- and a
way to face monetary needs, aggravated by the usurious
interest rates charged by money-lenders on their advances
to the peasantry. 6
b. The main questions.
This is not the place to go into the indisputable merits
of the model emerging from these propositions. 7 The thesis
rather in hand aims at questioning the applicability of this
set of assumptions to those parts of Greek agriculture which
specialized in market production for export, and in
particular to the regions which experienced the spectacular
expansion of currant viticulture, by far the most important
case of market oriented agricultural production in 19th
century Greece.
This is not of course a marginal issue. The currant

'Among them, one might refer that it synthesizes with accuracy the research so far accomplished and the existing literature, while at the same time avoiding the over-theorization typical of the discussions of the 1970s. These atte~oted to apply general interpretative schemes, but were supported by scanty evidence. I refer in particular to the works by political scientists such as Vergopoulos [l975lt Tsoukalas [1977] and Mouzelis [1978], who dealt with the periociization of capitalism in the Greek social formation, the integration of Greece (and of Greek agriculture in particular) into the international capitalist system, ana the reasons for the underdevelopment of the Greek economy. In contrast, the above set of assumptions stimulates research because it refers to concrete structures and behaviours, which are verifiable by empirical investigation.

"sector" included a considerable part of the Greek territory
and population, and a still more considerable part of Greek
agricultural production, and at the same time it directly
involved a large number of other regions, which established
intense demographic and economic exchanges with the currant
growing provinces. If the reservations proposed here are
judged valid, some frequent assumptions of Greek
historiography will need thorough revision.
Anybody who tries to interpret the expansion of currant
viticulture in 19th century Peloponnese by adopting the model
outlined above is faced with a serious problem: it is
difficult to understand how, if cash crops were just one
among several activities of peasant families seeking
subsistence, currant trade could have advanced so rapidly and
have assumed such impressive dimensions. This is particularly
the case if one bears in mind that currant expansion implied
deep changes in the traditional structures of Greek
agriculture: the colonisation of the previously deserted and
marshy coastal plains of the Peloponnese, the creation of new
villages in the lowlands and enlargement of those already
existing, the relative decrease of grain production and
increasing imports of cereals.
Moreover, currant growing was a long-term investment,
since the plant gave fruit several years after planting. It

involved land reclamation, security of property rights, farm
consolidation, infrastructure, buildings, wells, threshing
floors, ware-houses. How could these changes occur in the
framework of ~n agriculture which did not show any tendency
to alter its predominantly peasant character? Who supplied
the long-term credit required? And finally, who undertook the
risks arising from investment, from cultivation and
commercialization of a crop where the market was not only
characterized by profit opportunities, but also by
instability and recurrent cyclical crises?
c. Recent literature on the topic.
Ch. Agriantoni referred briefly to currant expansion in
her thesis on Greek industrialization, completed in 1984. 8 In
her account, full of insight, she pointed out that the
history of the currant trade, which was intimately connected
with deep changes within the peasantry, still remained to be
written. 9
In the last three years, several important contributions
on the topic have been published. 10 However, no answer was

provided to the above presented questions.
In his book on the city of Patras, N. Bakounakis deals
mainly with the formation of the group of leading merchant
families and their relations with politics and politicians.
In his paper on "La vigne et la ville", he shows the deep
involvement of Patras merchants in the financial organization
of currant cultivation. But although he notes both the long
term character of investment in the creation of currant
vineyards and the exclusively short-term character of loans
and advances by the merchants to the growers, he does not
explain how this evident contradiction was resolved. 11 On the
other hand, he hints that it was considerations of
profitability which led the peasants to specialize in currant
viticulture; 12 but he does not proceed further in that
direction because, as he rightly points out, the study of the
prevalent type of vineyard property and of exploitation would
require lengthy research in notarial archives . 13
10 ( ••• continued) research was well advanced. I cannot account fully for the work of Th. Kalafatis, because although the author kindly permitted me to consult some of his papers, I was unable to obtain a full version of his unpublished thesis.

P. Pizanias analyzes some aspects of the formation of
European demand for currants, with decisive repercussions on
the evolution of Greek production. Although he admits that it
is not easy to reconcile the impressive expansion of currant
viticulture with the supplementary role assigned to market
production by peasant families in their effort to guarantee
subsistence, 14 he avoids confronting this difficulty, which
is in any case somewhat marginal to the orientation of his
research.
In contrast, the role of the peasantry in currant
expansion occupies the central part of the work of
D. K. Psihogios. 15 Psihogios starts from the assumption that
peasant families aimed at subsistence through autarky, and
particularly that they tried to provide for their food by
cultivating their own grain. According to this view, any
market involvement of the peasantry could only be a result of
sheer dearth and of coercion. Since many of the questions
dealt by the author are very similar to those discussed here

arguments are reviewed into greater detail below. 16
d. Division into chapters.
The first chapter of the thesis tries to establish the
advanced degree of peasant specialization in currant
viticulture and its decisive impact in shaping Peloponnesian
agriculture. This objective is pursued by discussing data on
population growth, aggregate, regional and per capita figures
for currant production and exports, cereal production and
imports.
The second chapter deals with landed property and the
distribution of the "National Estates". Discussion draws
largely on detailed nominative research in the archives of
the small town of Arnalias - once an important centre of
currant production and trade which was undertaken
specifically to provide new evidence on these crucial
questions.
Chapters three, four and five examine respectively: the
commercialization of the crop and the organization of currant
trade, the problems relating to the creation of currant
vineyards, the technology and mode of cultivation. Particular

implied in the exposition. First of all, the Turkish conquest
in the XV century and four hundred years of Ottoman
domination deprived Greek history of the reality of native
aristocracy and allowed the ascending merchant strata to
occupy the summit of' social hierarchy. 17 Moreover, the War of
Independence culminated in the establishment of a state
characterized by a liberal-bourgeois legal framework, and
this, together with the fact that the revolutio0ary army was
massively recruited from the peasantry, swept away any
possibility of the continuation of social relations of
production based on extra-economic coercion. In other words,
by 1830, the requisites for the operation of markets wer-e- 
fully present. The question as to whether these markets
functioned, and how, is one of a different order.
On the other hand, taxation, another typical case of
intense interaction between the state and the economy, does
not seem to have played any particularly important role in
the currant sector. Since very early on, taxes on currant
production took the form of a fixed export duty and tended to
decrease, probably because the government had no intention to
create difficulties for a trade which provided the bulk of
the foreign exchange needed by the Greek economy - and the
government itself. Moreover, currants were a natural monopoly

attention is paid to the distribution of costs, risks and
benefits between merchants, wealthy farm owners and peasant
families and an attempt is made to outline the strategies of
each party as they derive from their mutual agreements. The
bulk of the evidence used in these chapters comes from local
archives and from the "Historical Archives of the National
Bank of Greece".
Chapter six proposes a model of interpretation for the
strategies of peasant families relating to the expansion of
currant viticulture, based on an analysis of the institution
of the dowry. This section is based almost exclusively on a
reinterpretation of published material.
e. The apparent absence of the State.
The reader will notice that although the thesis deals
mainly with relations between social classes and groups,
there is practically no explicit reference to the state. This
is not because I do not consider politics to be relevant to
the subject, but rather because of the difficulty of
establishing the relations between the state and social
classes, the state and the economy at the actual stage of
development of historical research in Greece.
But let me make here a few necessary suggestions which are

11
of the Peloponnese and did not face close competition on the
British market. As a result, the export duty, physically paid
by exporters, burdened consumer prices rather than growers.
At the same time, this cannot be assumed to have had a
perceptible influence on consumption, since the British
tariff on currants was several times higher.
It may thus be suggested that the low fiscal burden borne
by currant cultivation rather stimulated its development,
because it incited the movement to it of resources from more
heavily taxed sectors of agriculture - namely cerealiculture.
But this cannot be considered as a major factor for currant
expansion. The main advantage of the latter lay not in low
fiscal burden but in strong international demand.
In contrast with taxation, the distribution of the
"National Estates" was a political act with a very decisive
positive impact on the development of the currant trade. It
offered the opportunity for those wishing to invest in
currant vineyards to acquire full property rights on land 
secure ownership on the land was a very important requisite
for the undertaking of such an expensive and long-term
investment - at a moment when, after four decades of currant
expansion, it is probable that no more privately owned land
was any more available for sale in the currant growing

12
provinces. 18
At the same time, the law "On the distribution of the
National Estates" of 1871 offers a clear example of how
difficult it is to interpret political actions when empirical
verlfications of their social and economic impact are
unavailable. As noted above, the prevalent assumption is that
peasants were the main beneficiaries of the distribution. I
should add that this was also my original working hypothesis
for the case of Arnalias, soon to be rejected during research
in the archives. Someone who takes this assumption for
granted will try to find political reasons for the allegedly
pro-peasant character of the law. If, on the uther hand, the
accentuated concentration of the distributed national lands
in the hands of the local elite in Arnalias were to prove to
have been the case in many other regions as well - such a
verification would of course require a great deal of
exhausting research then any effort to interpret the
political reasons underlying the distribution would start
from quite different premises. 19
It is not part of my intentions to deny the necessity for
works trying to analyze Greek 19th century politics, but
18 It should be noted that a net distinction is proposed here between land in general, which was undoubtedly available throughout the 19th century, and privately owned land.
''As the reader will notice in the respective chapter, my view is not that distribution worked necessarily against the interests of the peasantry.

rather to give a warning against this kind of ambiguities. I
hope that the conclusions of the thesis may be useful to
research on the Greek State and social structure, at least as
a stimulus fo~ discussion. The hope that this should be so
was one of the reasons which pushed me to undertake the
study.

Chapter I. Expansion of currant viticulture, internal
agricultural colonization and peasant specialization.
"The economy of the great sea expanses takes [the
plains] to its service and condemns them to producing
crops for exports". 1
Fernand Braudel could very well have included the
expansion of currant viticulture in Southern Greece in his
famous account of the process of colonization of the
Mediterranean plains: the lucrative prospects of currant
production for export, mainly to England, was a major
incentive for the inhabitants of the Peloponnesian highlands
and of the Ionian Islands to settle in the fertile but marshy
coastal plains of the North and West of the peninsula. This
process, considered by Chr. Agriantoni as "the main event of
the Greek 19th century", 2 corresponded perfectly to the
phenomenon studied on a Mediterranean-scale by the French
historian. 3
1F. Braudel, The Mediterranean ... , p.84.
'According to Chr. Agriantoni (Oi aparhes tis ekviomihanisis ... , p.63): "the currant-vine provided the main motive force for the internal agricultural colonization; it attracted to the plain the population of the highlands, who had previously lived off traditional pastoral and manufactural acr:ivities. This movement has been a long term process which occupied the whole of the Greek 19th century and was in reality its main event."
'The colonization of the Mediterranean plains was often connected to :~e development of some export-oriented crop. Among the examples are madder, introduced to the County of Avigncn in the eighteenth century, for whic~. lowlying regions were drained and tne last marshes eliminated; the cotton ana tobacco which led to the improvement of the plain of sa:onica in the ear~y 20tn century; the vines which in 1900 made the Algerian Mitidja healtny, after (cont.:.nuea ... )

The impressive expansion of currant growing during the
19th century was a response to the quick rise of European,
and particularly British demand for fruit, brought about by
the "Industrial Revolution" - or rather by the possibility it
offered to wider strata of English society to diversify their
diet. 4 By a fortunate coincidence, the currant turned out to
3 ( ••• continued) centuries of unaccomplished efforts. "There is little room for doubt", suggests Braudel; "the land improvement schemes of the plains could only be financed by an influx of big profits from trade, long-term and large-scale trade" (F. Braudel, ibidem, chapter one: "The peninsulas: mountains, plateaux ana plair.s", vol.l, pp.25-102).
'The currant was grown in the Peloponnese and the Ionian Islands from the Middle Ages at the latest. "Currant" comes from "Corinth", the gulf of Corinth being the traditional origin of the plant (see The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary on historical principles). Winchester College , for example, included currants in its annual purchases of provisions in as early as 1393. Considered as a precious and luxury product, "they were used by the Warden and for feasting during Election and Audit weeks, for puddings on fast days and during Lent" (see Lord Beveridge & others [1939] p.74). The first to describe the currant-vine as a distinctive plant, different from the common grape-vine, was the French botanist Bauhin in the 16th century (see M. Lamprinidis [1905], p.4). "Vitis Carinthia sive apyrena" he called it, pointing to its main and precious characteristic, i.e. that berries of currant grapes are seedless and therefore are particularly good for consumption in a dried state. The first important expansion of currant cultivation occurred during the second Venetian occupation of the Peloponnese (1686-1715), helped by the colonization, drainage and irrigation policies followed by the Venetian administration (see Xavier Scrofani Sicilien, Voyage en Grece fait en 1794-1795, vol.3, p.l26, P. Topping [1974]; "A report on the economic and political situation in the Peloponnese at 1692", Efimeris Ellinikis Georgias, n.l8, 1/10/1861; Sp. Lampros [1900]. Also, M. Lamprinidis [1905] p.7, who states that F. Grimani, Procuratore Generale of the Peloponnese from 1705 to 1708, in a report to the Doge of Venice, described his efforts to propagate currant growing). It was only towards the end of the 18th century, however, that the currant trade started to develop at an accelerated pace. By that time currant consumption in Britain ceased to be restricted to the aristocracy, and st.arted t.o ent.er t.ne pudding of the ascending middle class; at a later date it would even conquer a place in the diet of the British labouring classes (see Hairetis [1883], p.481; according to S.Xenos [1883], p.390, popular consumption started from the :860s). Before the spread of modern techniques for conservation and transport of fresh fruit, the non-perishable and easily transportable currant was a very desirable commodity for British market and diet, traditionally poor in fruit. England was by far the most important consumer of currants t.hrougnout the h!st.ory of the currant trade. The only period which does not fall under this rule were the years 1878-1892. Following two years of low currant prices, 1877 and 1878, French industrialists found it profitable to substitute currants for grapes in wine and cognac production. Grapes were in great scarcity after the devast.ation of the French vineyards by the "phylloxera vastatrix" disease which start.ed t.o propagate in 1866 (see Postel-Vinay, Endettement et production agricole Exports ~o France took enormous dimensions, absorbed in t.he 1880s more t.han one third of the production and exceeded occasionally even brit.ish consurn!=Jtion (cont.inued ... )

be a nat ural monopoly of Southern Greece, not exposed to
competition from other countries enjoying lower interest
rates, where labour was cheaper and more abundant and where
better infrastructure existed. 5 The desirability of the small
4 ( ••• continued) itself. Sustained demand and prices resulted in an unprecedented wave of expansion of vineyards. But the euphoria was not going to last for long. The !:eduction of French imports in 1893 threw the currant sector into a terrible ::verproduction crisis, from which it never resumed. The increase of currant production during the 1880s was so formidable, that after the loss of the French market its export became impossible, even at prices below cost. St.!_ll, hardly can one blame the "french interval" alone for the defin'..tive stagnation of the currant sector. The rate of currant growth in the 1880s was one of the highest ever recorded; yet it was by no means much higher than those of the previous periods: currant production and exports multiplied by 2.5 between 1830 and 1845, by 2.0 between 1845 and 1860, increased 50% between 1860 and :875 and multiplied again by 2.5 in 1875-1890. Had world currant consumption advanced with the same pace in the 20th century as in the 19th, the sector would have resumed some ten or twenty years after the dramatic events of the early 1890s. But this was not the case, mainly because of the new techniques of conservation and refrigeration of fresh fruit which spread in the last decades of the 19th century and finally rendered currants obsolete as an item of popular consumption. The well-known commercial house of Messinezis, established in London, reported in 1895 that "the possibility of further expansion of currant consumption by the labouring classes is rather limited, because currants fail to compete with tinned fruits or jams, ready to eat. Currants need to be baked, and baking means expenditure and time which the labouring classes, working all day, cannot afford. Hence they prefer ready-made foods." (quoted in the yearly edition of t.he Ministry of Finance on the export trade of 1895) On the other hand, the phylloxera disease in France should by no means be considered to have had any significant effect on Greek currant production be:ore 1878. In particular, I think that the impressive expansion of currant vineyards in 1870-1878 (and of production until 1884, since new vineyards need about seven years to produce fruit) was completely unconnected from the destruction of French vines. First, because before 1878, France imported only trifling quam:~ities of Greek currants. Moreover, before 1877, French imports from the two other countries which produced raisins, namely Turkey and Spain, represented less than 14% of average Greek currant exports (for data on French imports, see Pizanias [1988], table 3.3, p.74). This quantity was as important as might be the variation of the Greek crop from one year to the following one. As a result, France does not seem to have stimulated the expansion of Greek production before ~878 not even through any indirect influence on international prices of similar products.
'Attempts to transp ant the currant vine to other parts of Greece fa'..led, because "although the plants have, in some cases, thriven well enough, the fruit: produced has been found to contain a seed in almost every berry." In other parc:s of the world, "attempts have been likewise made to grow the seedless currant for commercial purposes; in the Cape of Good Hope and in California only have they been partial successful, but neither in colour, flavour, aroma, or sweetness can the fruit produced in chose countries be compared to the Greek currant. The Morea, and the islands of Zance, Cephalonia, Santa Maura and a small portion of Acarnania and Aetolia, therefore, enjoy, practically, a natural monopoly of this article ... " (BRCREP 1894). This monopoly was finally broKen in the earLy 20th century, when Australia managed to produce currants and also started to export them (see G. Charit.akis [193l] p.78).

seedless grape in European markets therefore resulted in the
presence of numerous vessels in Patras at the time of the
harvest, willing to buy the crop at rewarding prices.
Greek historiography has often been tempted by the idea
of blaming currant monoculture as one of the factors
responsible for the lost opportunities of natior,.al
development. This argument is closely connected to the belief
that industrial "take-off" was the only path leading to an
advantageous integration with the international economy and
that the absorption by any other sector of resources which
could have been committed to the secondary sector was a bad
thing. Moreover, from this point of view, the development of
an agricultural sector not producing foodstuffs is considered
to have been still more negative because it did not
facilitate the reproduction of an urban proletariat, which
would in its turn have supported the development of the
secondary sector.
However, economic development is not (only) a question of
the availability of a "critical mass" of resources; it
depends, rather, on the socio-economic structures which
influence the strategies of the principal social agents.
There is no convincing reason of accepting that, if resources
were not committed to currant expansion, they would have been
employed in a better way. On the contrary, it may be argued
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


19
that specialization in a luxury export item was fully
rational, since Greece not only possessed a "comparative
advantage", but also held the international monopoly over the
production o~ currant raisins.
The absolute advantage of Greece in the production of
currants contrasted sharply with its comparative disadvantage
in most other branches of agricultural production. Cereal
cultivation, in particular, suffered from low levels of
rainfall, lack of fodder, of animal power and manure. 6
Increasing specialization of Greek agriculture in currant
viticulture may thus be considered to have been a reasonable
response to the opportunities offered by its integration with
the international market, since the revenue from currant
exports allowed Greek society to import increasing quantities
of cereals, the production of which would have probably been
a waste of resources.
In anticipation of one of the main conclusions of the
present thesis, it can on the contrary be argued that it was
not currant production in itself which limited the prospects
of national development, but that it was rather the socio
economic structures of the Greek society, and in particular
the predominance of merchant capitalism, which reduced the

Currant production in the Peloponnese multiplied 64 times
in the course of 63 years. In 1830, date of creation of the

litres. 7 By 1893, when the long golden era of currant trade,

lasting more than 60 years, was brought to an end by a severe
and protracted overproduction crisis, it had already reached
334,000 thousand litres. 8
From 1830 to 1839, currant production developed, at a mean
annual rate of 5.89%. Part of this increase was doubtlessly
to the gradual reconstruction of the vineyards destroyed
during the War of the Independence, which had left intact
only the vineyards of the province of Aigion. But by 1842,
all pre-revolutionary records of currant production were
surpassed and between 1839 and 1851, the average rate of
increase reached 15.17%.
In 1852 and for five years afterwards the crop was almost
completely destroyed by the "oidium tuckeri" disease, from
which it started to recover in 18 56, thanks to the
application of sulphur. Four years later, in 1860, production
again reached and surpassed its pre-1852 levels. From 1860
until 1893, it continued to increase at an average annual
rate of 4. 5%. 9
'Currant crops have always been the object of detailed observation and meticulous recording: accurate information on the volume of the crop was precious to Greek and foreign merchants employing their capital in the currant trade. Sales and purchases were regulated on the basis of the quantity of fruit available for export and prices were heavily influenced by crop variations. The most accurate series of total currant production of the Peloponnese are those presented by Pizanias [1988], table 1, pp.l28-131, reproduced in appendix II, p.315, below. Cross-checking of this data with information supplied by the annual British consular reports from Patras for the period 1857-1916, a source not used by Pizanias, confirmed the validity of the latter series, with variations of less than +1%.

labour and capital input. Crop reductions used to be the outcome of unfavourable weather or disease, factors that might heavily influence yields but did not diminish the volume of necessary inputs and expenses. On the other hand, we know that currant cultivation expanded continuously during the entire period 18301893 and that only following the onset of the severe overproduction crisis of the late 19th century in 1893 was there any decrease of the total surface of vineyards. It would therefore be misleading to include bad harvests in our calculations concerning the productive effort involved in currant expansion e.g. by using the method of moving averages. In effect, calculations were based on the following 28 annual crops, chosen out of a total of 64 currant seasons of the period 1830-1893: 1830, 1835, 1839, 1840, 1842, 1843, 1844, 1845, 1846, 1847 1 1 8 48 f l 8 4 9 f l 8 5 0 f 18 5 1 f l 8 6 0 I 1 8 6 3 r 1 8 6 6 f 1 8 6 7 f 1 8 7 1 I 1 8 7 6 f l 8 7 8 f l 8 8 : f .l 8 8 4 1 1886, 1888, 1889, 1891, 1893. The criterion for their selection has been simply that they exceeded the crop of any previous year. Considering single currant seasons, this method may represent an underestimation: crop increases used to be the combined effect of (a)favourable weather conditions and (b)extended planting in the previous twelve years (i.e. the time required for the currant plant to reach its maximum productivity). The fact that a given crop exceeded that of any revious year did not necessarily imply that it represented the ful~ output of he vineyards that had a.:.ready reached maturity. However, distortion becomes nsignificant when considering series extending over several years.

b. The geography of currant expansion.
During the first decades of the 19th century, vineyard
acreage increased mainly in the old currant producing
provinces of the northern Peloponnese, Patras, Aigialeia and
Corinth. 10 In those regions, producing the most sought after
and expensive quality of currants, almost every inch of land
suitable to currant cultivation was destined to surrender,
sooner or later, to the profitable monoculture. In the
territory of the municipality of Patras currant vineyards
rose from 400 hectares in 1833 (5,12% of cultivated land), to
3,179 ha in 1861 (43, 12% of cultivated land) . 11
By the late 1840s, the spread of currant vineyards started
to shift westward. Helped by the introduction of the ring
cutting technique, which increased productivity per unit area
and rendered feasible the planting of currant vines in rich
and humid soils, currant cultivation expanded at quick rates
in the large and fertile plains of Ilia and Trifilia. 12 In the
10According to Hairetis [1883] (p.388), before the revolution of 1821, the currant-vine was cultivated only in the provinces of Patras, Aigion and Corinth. Xavier Scrofani Sicilien, speaking about the currant crop of 1794, mentions only the provinces of Patras, Aigion (Aigion, Diakopto, Akrata), Corinth (Corinth, Xilokastron), and as a minor centre Glarentza, in the peninsula of Chlee',outsi (q'Joted by Lamprinidis [1905]).
11 See Bako'Jnakis [1988], table 5, p.137.
"According to Hairetis, (I kallierqeia tis stafidampelou ... , p. 99) "ringcutting was introduced in the Peloponnese from the island of Zante in 1848. At the beginning it was secretly applied only by some workers coming from this island. But neighbouring growers did not delay in discovering the secret of success, which spread quickly and was imitated by most farmers in all currant producing provinces. Thus, land until then considered totally unfit to currant (continued ... )

24
western Peloponnese, the rhythm of planting was particularly
rapid in the 1850s, when the oidium disease attacked the
vineyards and pushed currant prices to exorbitant levels,
leaving relat~vely intact the crop of Ilia. 13 In 1860, 49.85%
of the fruit produced in the main currant growing regions of
the Peloponnese was grown in provinces where the currant vine
had been almost unknown prior to 1840. In 1878, Ilia and
Trifilia alone produced 53.84% of the total currant crop of
northern, western and southern provinces of the Peloponnese
(see table I .1).
The main impulse of the delayed but spectacular currant
expansion in southern Peloponnese was due to the demand from
French wine producers, after the destruction of French
vineyards by the phylloxera disease; the French market, which
opened to Greek currants from 1879 to 1892, showed a marked
12 ( ••• continued)
cultivation, because of its very fertility, was without delay planted with currant vines, virtually as soon as ring-cutting was introduced. The neighbouring Ilia is an unfeigned witness. Before the adoption of the new technique, currant growing in that province was unthinkable and its fertile plains produced cereals in abundance. After the application of ring-cutting, all those plains were covered with currant vines; nowadays, in quantitative terms, Ilia has become the capital of currant production". This version of the introduction of ring-cutting cannot of course be adopted without reservation. It should also be mentioned that a book entitled "On the ring-cutting of plants and of the currant vine in particular" was published in Nauplion in the late 1840s. Unfortunately, I did not manage to discover any copy of it in any of the main libraries of Athens. On further details concerning the ring-cutting technique, see p.2~3, chapter V, below.
13The attacks of the oidium disease were less severe in the vineyards plant.eci on heavy and wet soils such as those in the western Peloponnese, which were also the first to recover after the application of sulphur. In the meantime, producers of the western Peloponnese were able to make good profits from the high prices prevalent due to the deficiency of supply. For figures of regional production in 1855, see appendix IV, p.317.

preference for the fruit of the southern provinces, because
although of low quality, it was cheap and fitted industrial
purposes perfectly. Thus, even with a considerable time lag,
after 1879 southern Peloponnese followed closely the example
of the northern and western provinces of the peninsula. In
the 1880s, the most rapid currant expansion occurred in
Pilia, Kalamata and Messinia; as noted in table I.l, their
share in total currant production of northern, western and
southern provinces of the Peloponnese passed from 16.41% in
1878 to 25.89% in 1888.
c. Evolution of productivity and acreage of currant
vineyards.
Currant cultivat ion varied with locality, according to the
nature of the soil, irrigation and rainfall, fruit quality
and price quotations on the market. It also changed over time
following the adoption of innovations. The most important
technical development throughout the 19th century was the
above mentioned technique of ring-cutting, introduced in the
late 1840s.
Notwithstanding regional and temporal variation, the main
technological features of currant agriculture remained,
however, unaltered across the centuries: the long time

26
usually not less than seven years 14 - that elapsed between
planting and full fruiting of the vine; the attentive care
required all the year round, which almost approached real
gardening; the persistently manual character of the most
labour intensive operations, hoeing and harvesting,
concentrated in limited periods of the year, early spring and
August respectively.
After the adoption of ring-cutting - which brought about
a "once and for all" increase of yields any further
increase of production involved further spread of currant
vineyards. It is true that the growing participation of the
western and southern provinces tended to raise the ratio of
total production to aggregate vineyard acreage of the
Peloponnese, since vineyards planted in those fertile plains,
although the gave lower quality fruit, were much more
productive than those of the ancient currant growing regions
of the northern Peloponnese. 15 But average yields do not seem
to have considerably improved over time. Most probably, this
"According to Asdrachas [1982], p.169, in the dry island of Zante, the currant-vine needed no less than fourteen years until coming to its full bearing. The information dates from late 18th century.
''There was an inverse relation between currant vine productivity and fruit quality, caused by the influence of the humidity of the soil. Dry and light soils of northern Peloponnese produced less but sweeter fruit; the more one moved tc the south, the more abundant but poorer in saccharine was the fruit of t:he currant: vine. Seven thousand Venetian litres per hectare in Ilia against: five hundred in Patras was the estimate offered by t:he Journal of Greek Agriculture, (n .2, November 1855, p. 77). In 1903, the estimate of A. Th. Nomikos was also 5, 000 litres per ha for Patras and 1, 000 or more for Trifilia and Calamata which is a rather exaggerated figure (A.Th. Nomikos, A orooosal for the solution of the currant auestion, Athens 1903, unpublished report:, HANBG, "currant:", file 6). See also Hairetis [1883j, p.lO, Agriantoni [1986], p.278,367; BRCREP 1879.

27
effect was strongly counteracted by the diminishing
productivity of earlier vineyards which started to grow old. 16
Estimates of currant vineyard acreage are available for
1860, (15,306 ha), for 1871 (22, 848 ha) for 1875 (29,138 ha),
for 1881 (41,206 ha) and for 1888 (53, 000 ha) 17 By a
fortunate coincidence, the harvests of 1860, 1871, 1881 and
1888, happened also to be good, and therefore representative
of the productive capacity of vineyards, which raised to
5,155 litres per ha in 1860, to 5,873 in 1871, to 5,409 in
1881 and to 5,381 in 1888. Presumably, after 1860, average
vineyard productivity varied only slightly over time - since
part of the variation presented by the above figures might be
put down to different climatic conditions. Thus, in 1860
1888, aggregate currant production and total planted surface
"See n.l3, p.l72, chapter IV, below.
17Unlike the very satisfactory state of currant production series, a legacy owed to the specific historical reasons discussed in n.8 above, stat~stics on the extension of currant vineyards are rare and present serious inconsistencies. 19th century observers usually calculated vineyard surface on the basis o;' output, assuming an unchanged average productivity. Although studies on the technological conditions of currant cultivation and accounts of production of individual vineyards tend to confirm this assumption, only estimates which have been the result of direct surface calculations are of any use to our purposes here. The older one is was the one supplied by the "agricultural census" of 1860 (Spiliotakis [1864]). Those of 1870 and 1875 are reported by the head of the greei< statistical services Mansolas (Mansolas [1876], Aooqrafikai ... , p.l8) who obtained the information from a "detailed inquiry undertaken with the assistance of the municipal authorities and under the control of the public finance authorities" (ibidem, p.4). The estimate for 1870 is indirect~y ceduced by the information that the figure for 1875 includes 6,290 ha planted in :ne previous 5 years. For 1881, see Thery [1905] pp.ll6-ll8. For 1888, see ?izanias .:988], table 1.1, p.3l. The last two figures refer to the total currant vineyard surface of Greece, including that of the Ionian Islands. For the purposes of the presen: study, they have been corrected so as to include or.ly the ?elopor.r.esian vineyards. Corrections were based on figures for 1860 and 1875, whicr, inc~ude separate data for Peloponnesian and Ionian currant acreage, as well as on tne information about the evolution of Ionian currant production.

28
increased at practically the same pace: the volume of the
crop rose by 4.70% yearly, while vineyards expanded at an
average annual rate of 4.54%.
d. Participation of currant exports in Greek foreign trade
and agricultural production.
In spite its rapid increase, vineyard acreage is only an
indirect index of the revolutionary impact of currant growth
on the Peloponnesian economy. Currant cultivation represented
an intensive use of the land, its most typical aspect being
the considerable amount of labour invested per unit area,
both for planting and cultivating the vines. It is
characteristic in this respect that vineyards were valued at
least seven and a half times the price of the land on which
they were planted. 18
Although covering a relatively modest part of total
cultivated land, the output of currant v iculture
represented a very important share not only of Peloponnesian
agricultural production and exports, but also of total
production and exports of the entire kingdom. As early as in
''Land prices in the coastal plains of the Peloponnese moved betwe~n 400 ana
1000 drachmas per r.a, according to locality and endowment with irrigation facilities (see ~ational Land Cession Registers ana tne Official Gadget o~ ne Greek Government F.E.K.). The respective figures for an hectare planted w· ~" currant vines was 3,000 to 12,000 drachmas (see BRC?.t:P 1859 ana chapter V, p.l85, below).

29
1860 1 currants represented 12.3% of the estimated value of
the total agricultural production of Greece (marketed and
non-marketed) 1 though at the same time currant vineyards
covered only ?. 0 6% of cultivated land. 19
Currant exports alone represented no less than 54% of
total exports of the kingdom in the period 1851-1892 1
20 being
for Greece by far the most important article of international
trade. 21 In 18 65 1 they represented 4 3. 3% of total Greek
exports, reaching the record level of 79.4% in 1877. Even in
the period 1881-1892 - not strictly comparable with that of
1865-1880 because from 1881 total Greek exports included the
exports of the new provinces Thessaly and Arta currant
exports never dropped below 50% of total Greek exports, often
reaching levels as high as 70%. 22
"see Pizanias [l988],~~table III, p.l34 and Spiliotakis [1864]. Accorcii:--.g to calculations of Petmezas<[l985},, based on Spiliotakis [1864] and Kostis 1987',
total cultivated land of €he P~loponnese (including fallow land) was 419, CO ha in 1860 and 459,100 in 1911.
"see appendix V, p.319, below.
21 It would not by any means be an overstatement to say that. currant production and currant exports were practically synonymous terms throughout t.he 19th century (see appendix III, p.316 below). As long as markets could be found, not a single sound grain of currant fruit ever escaped export., even when the crop was sold at prices barely covering cultivation expenses. Until 1893, any discrepancy between the volume of currant production a'hd export.s is to be attributed either to the part of the crop remaining for export in the following season, or to the part of the crop included in the productior! statistics b:.;t fir!ally discovered to be totally unsaleable and useful or!:y fer :ocal distillation purposes. Currant exports developed at the same impressive pace as currant production, and passed from 111,340 Venetian litres in 1865 to 378,895 litres in 1891. The above figures refer to the entire curra:-'.:.. productior; of Greece, because currant exports were recorded only at the national level; it is therefore impossible to treat Peloponnesian currants separately from Ioniar: or:es.
"See Pizanias [1988], table Ill, pp.l34-135.

30
Lack of data does not permit an assessment of the
proportion of currant exports to total agricultural
production and to the total exports of the Peloponnese.
Bakounakis, basing his calculations on data supplied by the
French consular correspondence, estimates that in the period
1833-1859, currant exports represented 78% of total
Peloponnesian exports. 23 Most probably, after 18 60, this share
was still greater.
e. Currant expansion and agricultural colonization.
As noted above, an even more important and long-lasting
impact of the ascendancy of currant monoculture on the
fortunes of the peninsula was the vigorous trend of in
migration and permanent settlement of peasant families in the
currant producing regions. The provinces of Achaia and Ilia,
deserted and lacking any form of agriculture when W.M. Leake
visited them in the early 19th century, 24 gradually became the
broadest area of dense population in the Peloponnese. As
stated by the Geographical Handbook of the British Naval
Intelligence Division, "the growth of population on these
maritime plains has been phenomenal, increasing by over 300%
23 Bakounakis [1988], table 13, p.l57.

from 1838 to 1938. This has been due almost entirely to the
development of the currant trade". 25
Between 1861 and 1888, the population of the coastal
lowlands of Northern, Western and Southern Peloponnese26
increased at an average yearly rate of 1.87%, against 0.9%
that was the corresponding figure for the rest of the
Peloponnese. 27 Between 1861 and 1896, no single province of
the Peloponnese increased its population at a rate even equal
to that of the provinces involved in currant production.
These latter presented growth rates ranging between 1. 97%
(for Ilia) and 1.51% (Messini), when the eastern (non
currant-producing) lowland provinces varied between 1. 45%
(Lirnira Epidauros) and 0.53% (Nauplia), and the highland and
insular provinces between 1. 29% (Mantineia) and 0.03%
(Troizin) . The only currant growing province which presented
a relatively low annual rate of population growth in 1861
25 See Naval Intelligence Division [1945], vol.3, p.l7. This process of internal colonization, the origins of which can be traced back to the 18th century and was already important by the end of it, continued well into the 20th century. According to Baxevanis [1972], p.28, in 1900 70% of the population of the Peloponnese still resided in areas above 1000 feet elevation; in 1961, 61% ~ived below 600 feet. By the mid-twentieth century, geographers could refer to the Peloponnese as an empty shell, its population scattered around the coast and its interior mountains empty (Kayser and Thompson [1964], p.203).

As indicated by 19th-century statistics of natural
movement of population, the higher rate of population growth
in currant growing provinces was by no means due to higher
natality or lower mortality than in other regions of the
peninsula; 29 the difference between the two sets of figures
indicates rather the continuous resettlement of families from
the arid and overpopulated highlands of the Peloponnese to
the previously desert and marshy northern, western and
southern coastal plains. 30
A concrete instance of the process of colonization
connected with the expansion of currant viticulture is
provided by the fact that many of the peasants appearing as
currant growers, share-croppers or planters of currant
vineyards in a substantial sample of contracts dating from
1877-1882, in the small town of Amalias, 31 were recorded as
natives of the Ionian Islands (Zante and Cephalonia) or of
mountainous provinces of the Peloponnese (Mantineia,
Gortinia, Calavrita) . This fact clearly indicates that these

people had only very recently settled in the region,
expressly in order to seek occupation in the currant sector. 32
f. The monocultural character of currant cultivation.
According to model estimates presented in table I.2, the
proportion of total population (urban dwellers included) of
the coastal lowlands of northern, western and southern
Peloponnese required to produce the currant crop was 15.95%
in 1860, 24.61% in 1878 and 37.18% in 1888. 33
Taken as such, these figures constitute the minimum
starting-point for the calculation of the degree of
specialisation of peasant population in the currant producing
regions. Many coastal lowland villages included in the
calculations were not actually producing any currants at all,
but the lack of a list of the currant-producing villages has

According to the censuses of the 19th century, males between 15 and 64 years old, defined here as forming the active male population, represented one out of every 3.5 Greeks (see Valaoras [1960] p.128). Thus, in order to arrive at an approximate estimate of the maximum average per capita currant output, the produce of 1.5 ha must be divided by 3.5. e.Data of 1881.
unfortunately made it necessary to employ higher levels of
aggregation.
Furthermore, obviously not all of the population was
peasants, given the considerable degree of urbanisation,
partly due to the flourishing currant commerce: six out of

35
the eight Peloponnesian towns counting over 5,000 inhabitants
in the census of 1879, were centres of currant trade (Patras,
Pirgos, Kalamata, Aigio, Messini and Filiatra) .
It is also more reasonable to assume that not all currant
producers were fully employed in currant cultivation, and
that many peasant families, instead of farming the maximum
possible acreage of vineyards, calculated at 3 ha for a
family with two male adult members, were farming 1.5 or 2.0
ha, spending the rest of their time in other crops or
occupations. Consequently, currant growers were still more
numerous than it is assumed in table I.2.
In the light of these observations, it is clear that
currant viticulture assumed progressively a monocultural
character, and became the main occupation of a very large
part of the Peloponnesian peasantry. 34
14 Th is conclusion runs count.er to the assurnption of recer.t Gree,~ h storiography that peasant families sought subsist.ence through differer.t:a:~cr. o activities (cfr. above, p. 3 of the introduction). For a rnore oet.a~_ec dscussion, see chapter V1, below.

B. Currant specialisation, cereal production and peasant
consumption.
All 19th-century observers agree and lament that
increasing specialisation of the limited resources of
Peloponnesian agriculture into currant production led to a
neglect of the other staple crops of the peninsula. Among
these, cereal production, the traditional hard core of
peasant agriculture and the basis of the everyday subsistence
of the population, appears to have perceptibly decreased,
especially in terms of per capita yields. The resulting
deficit was covered with increasing imports of Black Sea and
Danubian wheat, which absorbed considerable part of the
earnings from currant exports. 35
However true these observations may be, it should be noted
that the pessimistic tone of contemporary commentators is not
entirely justified. Any shift of resources from cereal to
currant cultivation increased the productivity of
agriculture, since, under the natural and social conditions
prevalent in the Greek countryside, currants were produced
much more competitively than grain. Peasant specialisation in
currant growing at the expense of cereal production is a
"See eg. BRCREP 1866: "Specie is very rare at Patras ... except at the shipping season for currants ... The gold finds its way eastward where it is wanted to send to Turkey and the Black Sea to purchase produce."

37
typical case of advancing division of labour combined with
the development of commercialisation of both production and
consumption.
Furthermore, increasing cereal imports were due not only
to the decrease of per capita cereal output, but also to the
improvement in the living conditions of the peasantry.
Specialisation of peasant families in currant viticulture
increased the productivity of their labour and their income,
permitting them to eat more bread. Not that peasants baked
much of the imported cereals; but now they were left free to
consume a greater part of the grain they kept producing,
since they could pay their debts and taxes with the monetary
income from the currant cultivation. Thus, it was to a great
extent the cities, who had previously covered their needs
from the tributes of the peasantry, who were now obliged to
import more grain for their consumption. 36

Psihogios [1987], p.Bl and graph I.6.l, detects an ir.ve::se associatio:-: between level of taxation of grain production and grain _'_;cpo::ts; although this accounted only for a small part of the rapid increase o~ ~~oo::ts, it indicates that the peasantry did not market the part of its grain production not delivered to tax collectors, but preferred to use it for its own consu~ption.

a. Evolution of total Greek cereal production, imports and
consumption.
The reported decrease in the trend of per capita cereal
production of the currant-growing provinces cannot be
verified by statistical elaborations based on regional
figures alone. The only 19th century figures at provincial
level are those offered by the agricultural census of 1860 37
and no other regional figures are available until 1911. But
in the last years of the 19th century, cereal cultivation is
reported to have increased considerably, in order to
counterbalance the loss of revenue caused by the long currant
crisis which started in 1893. 38 It is therefore not possible
to assess correctly the decline of cereal production during
the "classical era" of currant trade (1830-1893) by using
data of 1911.
On the other hand, several published estimates of national
"See Spiliotal<is [1864].
38 The British consul at Patras reported in 1903 that although i;; forfT'er t2_mes ~wo thirds o~ bread-stuffs were usually imported, during the precedi~g ~ew yea~s the import had greatly diminished; in 1903 it was estimated tnat only one tn:ro of required cereals would need to be imported, due to the reclamation of faiiow a:cd \.Jaste lands. As he sc:.ated, on the basis of his own observatior,s, "thousands of acres of land, marsh and forest in the plain of Acheloos, in the district of Missolonghi, Lepanto and Elis, which, being unsuitable for the currant plant, had been allowed to lie fallow for generations, forming the favourite resort of innumerable woodcock, snipe and wild fowl,have now been reclaimed, drained and put under cereal, tobacco and other crops by the peasantry" (BRCRE? 1903) .

Sources: For cereal production and import figures: Agriantoni !1986] p.362; Sinarelli [1984] p.368; Psihogios [1987] pp.28-41. Population figures of tne respective years are projections based on the censuses of population of l853, 1856, 1861, 1870, 1879, 1889, 1896, 1907.
a.Figures on cereal consumption are the sum of locally produced and imported cereals. For the years 1854, 1858 and 1860, exports of cereals to the Icn.:.an Islands are subtracted from the figures. We do not have any information on significant cereal exports from Greece after 1864, date of the annexation of the Ionian Islands, which were deficitary in cereals; consequently, we may presume that both Greek and imported grains were consumed locally. Production and population of the provinces of Thessaly and Arta, annexed to Greece in 1881, are subtracted from the respective figures for 1887 and 1900-0l. Figures of Thessalian cereal production are taken from Agriantoni [1986} p.286. All figures therefore refer to the pre-1881 Greek frontiers. Figures for 1887 and 1900-01 probably slightly underestimate consumption because they do not include the quantities of Thessalian cereals exported to Greece. After 1881, the latter was no longer recorded under the heading of imports of :he Greek Kingdom, simply because Thessaly became a part of it.

if they do not form any particularly continuous and reliable
set of statistics, they do offer a general idea of the
evolution of national cereal production. It is therefore more

convenient to put the available fragmentary and indirect data
on cereal production of the currant producing regions against
the general framework offered by aggregate national data.
Table 1.3 presents all the information which is available
on total national and per capita cereal production. Changes
in per capita figures of production during the period 1854
1887 (line 5) look
rather insignificant and might have been the result of
conjunctural variations of yields. However, it seems that in
reality the trend was slightly towards a decrease: we know,
for example, that the crop of 1860 (9, 513,000 koila, giving
8.73 koila per inhabitant) was considered rather
unsatisfactory by contemporary standards, though fifteen
years later, the good crop of 1875 could not supply more than
7.4 koila per inhabitant. 39 Presumably, either productivity
fell dramatically between 1860 and 1875, or, more probably,
sowed surface decreased considerably relative to the
population. On the other hand, a net improvement seems to
have occurred at the end of the century, and per capita
yields in 1900-1901, for example, reached 8.6 koila.
Notwithstanding the relative decrease in per capita cereal
production observed between 1854 and 1875, the per capita
quantity of cereals available for consumption (line 7) did

not diminish, thanks to increasing imports from the Black Sea
ports of Russia and the Danube. 40 Moreover, after 18 7 3,
consumption figures tended to increase and in 1887 and 1900
1901 they appear decisively higher: without doubt, this
tendency indicates that a sensible improvement in the living
conditions of the population took place over time. 41
b. Decline of cereal production and rising Peloponnesian
imports.
The slight decrease in the average national figures of per
capita cereal production conceals more important regional
differentiations. 42 As early as in the 1830s, the province of
Patras, in large part covered by currant vineyards, was
obliged to have recourse to the surpluses of Ilia and Aetolia
in order to cover its needs in grain; but the port of Patras
could still export some quantities of cereals produced in
these latter provinces. In 1834 the value of these exports
amounted to 226,081 drachmas. The detailed table of commerce
40 D.K. ?sihogios op.cit, orr,its altogether the imports from his ca~cc;_:_atiors of :he qua:ttity available for local consumption and therefore conclt.;des tha: fal~ing per capita yields led to decreasing consumption.
41 A similar :.rend towards improving living conditions was ce::.ectea by Chris:ina Agriantoni i:t the increasing share of wheat consumption in r la:ion to other, lower qualities of cereals. She es:imated that per cap ta wreat consumption increased from 3 koila per capita in 1851/:853 to ~,2 ~o~ a ~~ :875 (see Agr'..a:v:.or'.. ':986:).

of that port for 1838 did not yet include cereals among the
imported articles and in 1841 there were still some exports
of wheat, although amounting to only 12,500 drachmas. But by
the late 1840s, cereals had already become an ordinary object
of importation.
In 1853-1854, cereal imports to Patras still represented
minor values and quantities: the average value for those two
years amounted to 22,000 drachmas. And in 1859 the British
consul could still report that "the quantity of the grain
produced on the western side of the Morea is rather more than
is required for its consumption In 1858 about 20,000
quarters were exported to the Ionian Islands". 43 However, in
that same year 1859, Alexander Koumoundouros, minister of
finance, reported that wheat production of the Peloponnese
had decreased considerably in comparison to 1848. 44 By 1861
"See BRCREP 1859. Grain imports constituted an important element for the nutritive balance of the Ionian population, the first to devote their productive efforts entirely to currant monoculture. Local British authorities reported in 1850 that facilities were afforded "to those labourers from the Southern Islands who emigrate to the Morea and Candia during the harvest, and return at its close, bringing with them considerable quantities of grain." (BRCREP Ionian Islands 1850). In 1864, the British consul at Cephalonia stated that "the grain raised in the island is of the most ordinary description, and does not, one year with another, yield more than a five months' supply co the rural population, among whom it is most chiefly consumed; but the supply is eked out in the case of the labouring classes, who migrate in thousands to the opposite continent of Greece during the spring and autumn in search of employment, and bring back the fruit of their earnings in the shape of grain, of which each labourer is allowed to introduce twenty kilos duty free." (BRCREP Cephalonia 1864). Simi~ar i;;formation is supplied by the British consul at Zante in his account for l865: "The grain grown in the island is good, and suffices for about three months, being principally consumed by the rural population. But the labouring classes usually subsist for two months more on the corn which they receive in the Morea in exchange for their labour during spring and autumn ... "(BRCREP Zante 1865).

43
1862, cereal imports to Patras amounted to 324,000 francs, 10
times the respective figure of 1853-1854. 45
From 1866, the increase of cereal imports to Patras became
impressive. According to the calculations of Ch. Agriantoni, 46
there was a further multiplication by 10 until 1879-1880 (3.3
million drachmas on the average), and the yearly rate of
increase amounted to 8.8% from 1866168 to 1888190 (in
triennial averages), reaching 15% for the shorter period of
18 66 I 68 to 18 7 4 I 7 6. These rates were much higher than the
respective national figures, which amounted to 3.6% yearly
from 1866168 to 1888190 in value and 3.4% in volume.
As noted above, increasing cereal imports to Patras were
necessary in order to cater for increasing per capita
consumption and to counterbalance the decline of local
production, which accelerated in the last few years of the
"classical era" of currant expansion, when specialisation in
currant monocul ture reached its maximum level. In 18 92,
consul Wood wrote that "cereals produced in the Morea only
suffice for 2 months or 3 months' consumption. The remaining
requirements are principally imported from Russia, the
Danube, and elsewhere, which is a great drain on the

resources of the country." According to the consul, it was
much to be desired that "greater thought and attention be
directed towards the growing of cereals in this district; but
the peas?ntry have devoted all their energies to the
growing of currants, and all other branches of industry and
husbandry are neglected. " 47 And again, in 18 94: "although most
kinds of cereals are grown in the Morea, the quantity does
not nearly suffice for local consumption, and about 2/3 of
the required supply are imported from the Russian and
Danubian Black Sea ports." 48 And in 1895: "The inhabitants of
the Morea instead of growing cereals for their own
consumption ... import very large quantities of wheat from
Russia and Turkey, and maize, barley and oats from other
parts of Greece." Had they not given themselves entirely to
currant growing, the consul stated, the inhabitants of the
Peloponnese would have easily ensured grain sufficiency. 49
But, as suggested above, one may seriously doubt whether the
consul's views were more correct than those of the
Peloponnesian peasants, who had several strong reasons for
dedicating their efforts to the expansion of the profitable
monoculture.

c. Tax receipts as an index for regional variation of cereal
production.
A further indication of the inverse relation between
currant specialisation and evolution of cereal and other non
currant agricultural production is offered by the examination
of the provincial land-tax receipts, a useful alternative
indirect index for the evaluation of agricultural production
when no direct estimates are available.
After the establishment of the Greek State and until 1880,
Greek agricultural taxation was based on two direct taxes
which were proportional to gross production, namely the land
tax and the "right of usufruct of the National Estates". By
contrast, currant production was subjected almost exclusively
to a special duty imposed on its export. 50 There fore, the
receipts of direct taxation reflect the development of non
currant agricultural production alone.
Provincial receipts of direct agricultural taxation are
50Th is was as far as state taxation was concerned. There were other, municipal, duties on currants, but the respective receipts do not appear on the state accounts.

both available and comparable for the period 1856-1874. 51
Those of the currant growing provinces of Ilia and Aigialeia,
of the non-currant growing Mantineia, Megalopolis,
Lakedaimon, as well as those of Pilia - Pilia is considered
here together with the non-currant growing provinces, since
it was not yet specialized in currant production, 52 are
presented in graph I. 2 and I. 3. Graph I. 2 represents the
trend of total land-tax and "usufruct right" receipts and
graph I.3 represents the trend of the respective per capita
figures. 53
"Tax receipts, collectable, collected and due are reported separately for each provincial public treasury and each tax in the yearly official edition "Accounts of the Greek State". "Accounts" available for the period under discussion here are those of the years 1856, 1858, 1859, 1861, 1865, 1866, 1867, 1871, 1873 and 1874.
"In Pilia currant culture started to become really important only after 1878 (see appendix IV, p. 317 below).
53 All calculations are based on collectable tax receipts and not on those actually collected: it is irrelevant for our present purposes which part of receipts "due" was actually paid on time. Figures are available for the years: 1856, 1858, 1859, 1861, 1865, 1866, 186·7, 1871, 1873, 1874. Land-tax or "tithe" rates changed as follows: 10% up to 1860, 9% for 1861, 5% from 1862 to 1866, 8% from 1867 to 1875, 7% from 1876 until the abolition of the tithe by the prime-minister Trikoupis in 1880 (see Franghiadis [1986] p.31). The "right of usufruct" was a kind of rent on state-owned cultivated land (see chapter II, below) and represented 15% of gross production throughout the period. In order to render tax comparable receipts of different years and from different provinces, it has been assumed that the share of cultivated national land to total cultivated land in each province was as in the census of 1860 (Spiliotakis [ 1864]). Both land-tax and usufcJct provinc1al receipts appear together in the State accounts under a single article. Thus, a different weighted relationship of tax receipts to total agric~l~ural prod~c::on had to be calculated for each province, according to different percentages of national to total cultivated lana, and for each period according to its di~ferent 11 tithe" rate: e.g. foi:" the period up to 1860, when the "ti::.he" represer:::.eC ~8% of gross product, it was assumed that in the province of Ilia, where nat~o:-:a.:. land amounted to about 2/3 of total cultivated land, tax receipts were 12/3 • 0.15) + 0.10 = 0.20 (2/3*15% for the "right of usufruct" and 10% for the tithe); that is, overall tax receipts for Ilia, as they appear in the State budget :'or the years 1856, 1858 and 1859 are considered to be one fifth of gross agricultural product of the province. Calculations of this sort are no longer possible after the distribution of the national lands to private hands, as this led to the gradual disappearance of the usufruct tax.

In terms of annual rates, the trend of agricultural fiscal
receipts for 1856-1874 were as in table I. 4. The currant
growing provinces of Ilia and Aigialeia display tendencies
that separate them clearly from Pilia and the three non
currant growing provinces. Land taxes in Ilia and Aigialeia
yielded falling returns in 1856-1874, though in Pilia,

Mantineia, Megalopolis and Lakedaimon they continued to
increase, at least until 1874. Per capita receipts were
decreasing in all the provinces of our sample except in
Pilia; but the negative trend is definitely stronger in the
currant-producing Ilia and Aigialeia. It should be noted
that, in terms of fertility and physical terrain, the plains
of Ilia and Aigialeia had further resemblances to Pilia than
to the highlands of Mantineia or Megalopolis. Had Ilia and
Aigialeia not specialized in currant growing, they could have
developed their cereal production as quickly as Pilia; and
this reinforces the conclusion that currant growing was to a
large extent supplanting cereal cultivation.

There is little need to add that the figures on which
table I.4 and graphs I.2 and I.3 are based cannot lead to any
reliable estimate of the real volume of agricultural output
of the six provinces. A multitude of factors could influence
fiscal receipts and alter their relation to the value of
gross production: changing prices, transformations of the
structure of cultures (other than the principal one
consisting of increasing specialisation in currant growing),
minor changes in the system of taxation. But the overall
tendency indicated by these figures is be~ond doubt: non
currant agricultural production of the currant growing
provinces - and especially cereals, which yielded the bulk of
the land and usufruct tax receipts developed at a
perceptibly lower rate than that of the other regions of the

Peloponnese and clearly lower than the rate of population
increase.
d. Cereal cultivation and currant viticulture:
incompatibility and complementarity.
The data discussed above leave no doubt about the
declining trend of per capita cereal production which
accompanied 19th century currant expansion. This conclusion
is further confirmation that the peasantry became
increasingly engaged in and devoted most of their efforts to
the production of currants. Peasant families probably tried
to farm as much area of currant vineyard as possible; the
only limit to this effort was the capacity of the male adult
members of the family to meet the labour demands of the main
tasks of cultivation during the most busy periods,
concentrated in the months from January to the end of August,
with a relative pause in June and July. Hence, less time was
left to cater for the growing of other crops, whose volume of
production naturally tended to show a relative decrease.
The predominance of currant-growing ove~ cerealiculture
is particularly explicit with reference to maize. Maize grew
well in the currant-growing western coastal plains of the

51
Peloponnese; 54 however, it could not be easily combined with
currant cultivation, because ploughing and sowing of maize
were performed in late January or February. This coincided
with hoeing, which was, in relative terms, the most demanding
task of currant cultivation in male adult labour. 55
As a result, maize production in the currant producing
regions diminished in the period 1860-1911 from 21.4 million
okes to 20.5 million okes, although at the same time in the
rest of the kingdom it increased from 33.5 to 52.6 million
okes. 56 The decrease of per capita maize production in the
currant producing provinces is even more remarkable, if one
bears in mind their rapid demographic growth. In the case of
the province of Patras, which pioneered currant expansion
since a very early date, the French consul reported that as
early as 1844 maize production had recorded a spectacular
decline. 57
The priority accorded to the currant did not, however,
lead the rural population to abandon altogether cereal
production, which was so precious to its daily consumption.

"For maize cultivation, see Psihogios D.K. [1987] p.39, o:nos ?s.:.nogios [1979] n.34, pp.l027-l03l, Harir.on [1889] p.39. For details on the tasi< of currant cultivation which consists of 11 hoeing t.he ground into sodsnf see chap:e:c V, below.

52
Peasants did not disregard occupations which could be
successfully combined with currant growing. During the months
left free by currant cultivation, that is from September to
January and in high summer, prior to the preparations for the
harvest in mid-July, currant growers employed themselves in
the production of winter cereals, wheat, barley, oats, olives
and wine grapes.
There are clear signs in the calendar of currant growing
that, whenever it was possible, certain labours in the
vineyards which coincided with the cultivation of winter
cereals were put off to another period of the year, even at
the cost of further encumbering the most busy periods of
currant cultivation. 58 Moreover, currant farms often included
arable fields, so as to allow growers to combine easily tasks
of winter cereal cultivation with work in the vineyards.
Arable land adjacent to the vineyard constituted, in
addition, a useful reserve, readily available. for planting
currant vines as soon as the landowner found the means
required for enlarging his farm. 59
Thus, grain production did not decline in absolute terms,
but only relative to population and to the general

development of agriculture. As late as 1893, when currant
specialisation was at its apex, the British consul at Patras
reported that "the currant growers and peasantry in general
... , with few exceptions, possess plots of land in the plains
and near their villages in the mountain districts, where they
grow maize and wheat for their own wants". It may be
concluded that the peasantry always kept a door open to fall
back on cereal production for home consumption; an attitude
which proved very useful indeed, especially in cases of
currant crisis. 60
On the other hand, it must always be remembered that any
agricultural activity continued and developed only within the
margins left by the predominance of currant monoculture.
Tasks of currant growing were the dominant feature of the
agricultural calendar, and maximiza-cion of currant production
became the main objective of the peasantry. 61 It is emblematic
in this respect that in many regions, during the all
"Eg. BRCREP Pirgos 1884 reported that, due to the severe crisis which !',it ocal currant production in 1883 and 1884, "latterly more attention than was usual is being given to the cultivation of breadstuffs, the production of which is estimated to cover this year the requirements of nine months' consumption". See also n.38, above.
"It is not possible to accept the objection that "currant cultivation did never become a monocul ture", on the grounds that "even at the moment of major development, currant-vines never did cover more than 25% of cultivated surface in any of the currant-growing provinces" (O.K. Psihogios il987] p.40). Not on::_y because at the level of the municipality, a less extended unit than tha~ of the province, respective percentages were much higher than 25% (for the concrete example of the municipality of Patras see p.23 above), but mainly because there is little sense in assessing in terms of surface the relative importance o~ a cultivation which makes such an intensive use of the land, especially ·wner compared with crops that are extensively cultivated, such as cereals - see a:so p.28 above.

54
encompassing trend of the 1880s towards currant monoculture,
which pushed specialisation of Peloponnesian agriculture to
its utmost limits, when no more land suitable for currant
cultivation was available, centuries-old olive trees were
eradicated in order to cede their place to additional
vineyards. The British consul at Patras Thomas Wood, in the
annual account for the year 18 92, related that "the alive oil
crop in the Morea is likely to show an annual decrease, as
many fine olive groves are being ruthlessly cut down to make
way for currant and grape vineyards, which the peasants find
more remunerative". 62 Three years later, in 1895, when the
overproduction crisis had already started, Thomas' successor
F. B. Wood, commented: "It is strange that the Greek peasantry,
usually so intelligent, should have been so short-sighted as
to deprive themselves of an article which is of absolute
necessity, and which, once done away with, cannot be replaced
for many years. " 63

e. Agricultural colonization, currant trade and cereal
production.
The secondary position assigned to grain cultivation in
comparison to the absolute priority granted to currant
viticulture is also illustrated by the geography of migratory
movements. As noted above, rates of population growth in the
currant-growing regions, when compared with those in the rest
of the Peloponnese, do not leave any doubt about the strong
influence exercised by this profitable monoculture on
migratory movements (rapid population growth being understood
here as an index for in-migration) . 64
It may be added that, as shown by the figures presented
in table I. 5 and illustrated in graph I. 4 and I. 5, the
development of cerealiculture, in contrast with currant
cultivation, seems to have had little influence on the
choices of the migrants.

"?sihogios [1986] argues that grain exerted a stronger influence or: t e decisions of migrants than did currants. In order to prove his assumption, e
claims that the correlation coefficient of rates of populatior: gro~th of a~: : e Greek provinces with the per capita cereal production in each of them (r = ~.5 , p < 0.001) is stronger than that with the per capita currant production (r
0.40, p < 0.01). But this conclusion is unfounded, since currant viticul:ure ·was restricted to a few provinces, and therefore per capita currant production was in no means normally distributed over the entire set of provinces of the Greek ki!",gdor, With a strongly skewed distribution the significance tha: car: be attache to such correlation coefficients is far from evident. The same conclus on is repeated in Psihogios [1987] p.l22, n.8.

f. An interpretation of the differentiation of agricultural
colonization within the currant-growing Peloponnese.
Currant expansion, agricultural colonization and the
specialisation of the Peloponnesian peasantry in currant
viticulture were different aspects of the same historical
process. Indeed, it was neither possible for the population
of the Peloponnesian mountains and of the Ionian Islands to
colonize the fertile coastal plains of the peninsula without
the enhanced revenues generated from currant exports, nor
could such a labour-intensive type of agriculture have ever
expanded so quickly without involving the increasing
specialisation in it of an increasing number of people.
However, the evolution of in-migration and of
specialisation in currant viticulture was not uniform
throughout the currant growing Peloponnese. And as noted
above, differences in the rate of population growth between
currant-growing provinces cannot be explained by differences
in per capita cereal production.
The fact that currant growing provinces were only very few
renders impossible any regression analysis· of the factors
which influenced the choices of the migrants. In the
following paragraphs a tentative interpretation of these
factors is advanced, based on the data presented in table I.6
and on the scattergrams presented in graphs I.7 to I.l2.

It is striking that the decisions of migrants do not seem
to have been influenced by the speed of regional currant
expansion: as shown in graphs 1.9 and 1.10, population growth
was rather negatively associated with the rate of growth of
production. On the other hand, population growth was
positively connected with the per capita currant production
in each region: graphs 1.7 and 1.8 show that the rate of
population growth in each province and in a given period of
time was positively associated with the per capita currant
production at the beginning of the period of observation.
The inverse association between rate of population growth
and rate of increase of currant output leads to a negative
statement: if rapid growth of production is accepted as an
index for the existence of plenty of land available for the
expansion of currant vineyards, the fact that rapid growth of
currant production in a given region was not positively
associated with population growth shows that the availability
of fertile land, adapted to the expansion of currant
viticulture, was not the most important reason in attracting
migrants, whose arrival was the main factor which determined
the differentiation of rates of population growth in
different provinces.
Closely connected with this inverse association is the
fact that the level of per capita production of currants and
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


66
its rate of increase were also negatively associated with
each other (see graphs I .11 and I .12) . This may well have
been because, as early as in 1860, specialisation in currant
viticulture was already very advanced in some provinces, and
further specialisation probably hit against technological and
social limits.
However, viticulture continued to expand rapidly, even in
provinces which had already achieved a high degree of
specialisation. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the
impossibility for the native population of rapidly increasing
the already high level of its per capita production created
acute labour shortages, which offered migrants many
opportunities to find an occupation and creditors wishing to
advance them loans. If this is the case, the main factor
determining the distribution of migrants between the currant
growing provinces of the Peloponnese will have been the
difficulties encountered by local societies in their effort
to exceed certain limits of specialisation in currant
viticulture.
On the other hand, the above mentioned negative
association between population growth and rate of increase of
currant production was probably an indirect effect of the
positive association between population growth and level of
specialisation; a high level of specialisation probably also

67
indicated relative greater scarcity of land for new vineyards
and greater difficulty in finding labour to plant and
cultivate additional vineyards. As a result, in provinces
where currant specialisation was very advanced - and in which
rates of population growth reached the highest levels
production could develop only at a relatively slower pace.
g. The case of three selected provinces, Aigialeia, Ilia and
Pilia.
Further confirmation of the above conclusions is supplied
by the comparison between level of specialisation in currant
viticulture and contribution of population growth to the
evolution of regional production between 1878 and 1888 in
three of the currant growing regions of the Peloponnese,
Aigialeia, I1ia-Olimpia, and Pilia, typical of the northern,
western and southern pattern of currant growth respectively. 66
Specialisation is here assessed in a more accurate way than
in table I.6, with the aid of model estimates of maximum
achievable per capita production in each province, according
to local productivity of the vineyards.

a.On regional distribution of production, see table I.l. As noted above, crops of 1878 and 1888 were abundant, and therefore representative of regional productive capacity; the closest censuses of population are those of 1879 and 1889. Per capita product reported here is the division of the 1878 and 1888 fruit by the 1879 and 1889 population: since all calculations are reported on the basis of annual rates, assumed to be uniformly distributed in the short run, taking into account the one-year difference between the censuses and the respective regional distributions of production would be an unnecessary complication, not yielding any significant improvement in the accuracy of the operation. On population figures, see n.b above. For the method of calculation of model maxima per capita product, see table I.2 above; average productivity of vineyards was recognized as 4,500 litres per ha in Aigialeia, 6,000 in Ilia-Olimpia and 7,000 in Pilla. For the rate of natural population growth, see n.27 above. For the sake of the comparison of tne relative contribution of population growth and of the increase of pro-capita production (specialisation intensification) to currant growtn, the rate of increase of production (r.) may be expressed as

69
In Aigialeia, already in 187 81 the degree of
specialization of the population had assumed very high
levels, since more than half of the inhabitants were needed
to produce th~ currant crop (see table I.7, line 4). Further
increase of per capita production could proceed only at a
very slow pace (1.24% yearly- see table I.7, line 7) and
most of the increase of total production was due to the
increase of population. According to the estimates presented
in table I. 7, 64% of the increase of currant output of
Aigialeia between 1878 and 1888 was due to population growth
(table I.7, line 10), obviously through massive in-migration.
The provinces of Ilia and Olimpia constitute an
intermediate case. The percentage of the population required
to produce the currant crop was already high in 1878 (29.3%
see table I.7, line 4), much higher than in Pilia (9.7%) 
but not as high as in Aigialeia (51.28%). No doubt,
considerable margins for further specialisation of the native
population were still there to be exploited, since per capita
production continued to increase by 4. 54% yearly, and in
1888, the population employed in currant cultivation reached
45.7% of the total. This increase of per capita production
was responsible for 67% of the achieved rate of growth of
production (in Aigialeia, the respective figure was only
36%); but in-migration played an increasing role in Ilia
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


70
Olimpia and accounted for no less than 33% of the growth of
production (against 64% in Aigialeia and only 10% in Pilia).
Pilia presents a totally reverse example. In 1878, per
capita currant output was still at a very low level in
comparison to the two other provinces. It is not therefore
astonishing that further specialisation of the inhabitants of
Pilia could by itself lead to very substantial increases of
production. Nine tenths of the spectacular increase of
currant production between 1878 and 1888 (18.3% yearly) was
caused by the increase of per capita output (table 1.7, line
9) . The effect of population growth during the same period
was comparatively trifling (10%, line 10).
The differences between the trajectories followed by the
three provinces in 1878-1888 might therefore be ascribed to
the different stage of specialisation in which they were
found in 1878. It should moreover be noted that there was a
strong tendency towards uniformity; in 1878-1888,
Ilia-Olimpia approached the degree of specialisation of
Aigialeia in 1878, and the late-comer Pilia almost filled the
gap separating it from Ilia-Olimpia. Most probably, had
currant trade continued for another two decades to be as
profitable as it was in the 1880s, all three provinces would
have reached equally advanced levels.

h. Currant trade, capital and migrants: some suggestions.
Currant growing for export was a clear case of voluntary
specialisation, very different from the forced
commercialisation through the levy of taxes, typical of grain
cultivation for home consumption. The fact that peasant
families, not subject to any sort of extra-economic coercion,
continued for more than a century to settle massively in the
fertile but marshy plains of the Peloponnese in order to
cultivate currants, is a strong indication that currant
viticulture offered them better living conditions than their
traditional occupations, namely grain cultivation and flock
herding.
As noted above, peasant families tended to move to
provinces where specialisation of the population in currant
production was already much advanced and where further
expansion of vineyards required extra labour, rather than to
provinces characterized by greater availability of land
suitable to currant viticulture. This is not surprising;
peasants could not plant and cultivate currant vines on their
own, because these activities required the possession of much
capital. What particularly attracted them in currant
viticulture was rather the opportunity to borrow capital,
useful for the full deployment of their and their families'
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


72
labour resources and for increasing their productivity.
In fact, besides immigrants, currant trade was also a pole
of attraction for capital from the foreign markets, the
exporting cities and the national banking system. 67 The
formation of peasant family farms working on borrowed capital
was much favoured by the relative availability of credit in
the currant sector, constituting the major exception in an
economy suffering deeply from lack of resources. For
instance, peasants could farm vineyards under share-cropping
agreements; they could also obtain cultivation loans by
selling their crop in advance, or acquire property by
undertaking the creation of the elite's farms, in exchange
for half of the vineyard they planted.
It is true that the greater part of the enhanced
productivity of the family farm operating in the currant
sector was absorbed by the high rates of interest on loans,
as well as by the manipulation of fruit ma:rkets by the
currant merchants. As will be shown in the following chapter,
currant and money markets were controlled by hierarchically
organized merchant networks, which did not fail to draw
considerable benefits from their commercial and financial
transactions with the growers. Nevertheless, it seems that,
in an environment of acute underpopulation and labour

73
shortage, peasants managed to keep a not insignificant part
of the increased output of their labour, at least sufficient
to permit them to improve their previous living conditions. 68
~That relative scarcity of labour in the Peloponnese resulted in high wages is also proved by the fact that in the over-populated Ionian Islands - place of origin of great part of the migrants who settled in the western coasta~ plains of the Peloponnese - labour cost to currant farm less owners than it did to their Peloponnesian counterpart (see BRCREP Cephalonia 1865). It seems, however, that increasing out-migration from the Islands exerted a positive influence on the level of Ionian wages, which gradually tended to reach those of the Peloponnese (BRCREP Cephalonia 1865 and 1866).

Chapter II. Distribution of the "National Estates",
concentration of landed property and farm consolidation.
Currant expansion induced deep transformations in the
agricultural landscape, as well as in both socio-economic and
legal relations of land property. In particular, it favoured
the establishment of private ownership rights and it
encouraged land concentration and farm consolidation. As will
be suggested in the course of this chapter, these changes
were undertaken principally by the wealthy and powerful local
families who possessed their own capital and easy access to
credit from the currant exporting houses and the national
banking system.
A. The question of landed property and the affair of the
National Estates.
Before the introduction of currant viticulture, the
coastal plains of the Peloponnese were almost deserted and to
a large extent covered with marshes. The prevailing
cultivation techniques were primitive and the use of the land
extremely extensive. Private landownership rights were almost
unknown, except in the case of intensively cultivated fields
and orchards situated close to the villages. The rest of the
land belonged in theory to the state - before 1830 to the

76
Sublime Porte and after that date to Greece; in practice,
nobody was very much interested in the exact legal status of
areas of little economic use, except to shepherds and
peasants who practised primitive cultivation.'
In contrast, currant vineyards were associated with a very
intensive use of the land and with permanent land
improvements. The currant fields were enclosed with trenches,
drained, cleaned of stones, ploughed in depth; the
construction of wells, cisterns, huts and ware-houses was
1At the beginning of the 19th century, Greece was one of the less populated countries of Europe and Asia, and the cultivable area exceeded by far cultivated
land. Average population density was 19.26 inhabitants per km2 in 1843, 23.08 in 1861, 37.37 in 1896 (calculations include only the Peloponnese, Central Greece and the Cyclades Islands) . Spiliotakis [ 1864] presents an international comparison which shows that the share of uncultivated land could only be compared to Russia with its enormous steppes (cfr. also Mansolas [1867] p.50). Most parts of the fertile plains of the kingdom were totally deserted and were covered by extensive marshes, whereas the majority of the population lived in the arid but healthier mountainous regions. "Greece is surrounded by lakes and swamps from all sides", stated an anonymous article of Efimeris tis Ellinikis Georaias of November 1855 (n.2, p.51): "Lakes and marshes oover an area of almost 230,000 hectares, which favour the propagation of fevers and other diseases which torment the already scarce population of Greece. The lowlands suffer more. The swamp fevers are more injurious to those coming from the healthier climate of the mountains to the plains to pass the winter. That is the reason why entire populations live in a state of continuous migration, similar to herds of sheep, and cannot settle in the empty plains. Hunger and snow chase them away from the mountains during the whole winter; fevers drive them out of the plains back to the mountains for six months, as if they were in a state of siege. Those obliged to pass the summer in the plains, when they fall ill, instead of searching for another remedy, turn back to the highlands; those who insist on staying, run the risk of catching chronic diseases due to swamp fevers ... ". According to McGrew [1979], p.467, "almost all the well-watered valleys contained marshes harbouring swamp fever which the mountain people had learned to dread. Many of the postindependence settlers of marshy regions fell victims of the endemic malaria wnich menaced the valleys until well into the 20th century."
Pasturage and nomadic methods of cultivation predominated in the empty lowlands. Part of the forests was often burnt, either in order to be cu2.tivated to exhaustion and then to be abandoned for several years or in order to provide fresh grazing for the shepherds' flocks; in the following year, the destruction provoked by fire was completed by the teeth of sheep and goats. tields flooded during winter by torrential rivers maintained their natural_ fertility ana could be sowed in early spring; then, if early autumn rains did not destroy the crop, the harvest could be abundant (see Mcgrew [1971] p.254; Dertilis [1988] p.~4; Efimeris tis ellinikis aeorqias, "On Greek Agriculture" [1855] p.52,73; Whiteb;_ed [1886] p.220. The British consul at Patras reports that "peasants apply wilful.iy fires to the forests": see BRCREP 1881).

77
indispensable to cultivation. Moreover, the vines needed five
full years of special and attentive treatment before yielding
any fruit at all. Hence, the possession of secure and
unconditional property rights over the soil supporting the
future vineyard was an important prerequisite for the
undertaking of such an expensive investment.
The intensive use of the land in currant viticulture, so
different from the primitive and extensive agriculture
prevailing in most other Greek regions, is the main
explanation for the success of 19th century projects of
general sale of state lands in currant growing provinces, as
opposed to the poor results obtained by the same projects in
the rest of the Kingdom. 2
a. Estate property under Ottoman rule.
In early 19th-century Greece, the acquisition of full
ownership over a piece of land was not a mere question of
paying for it. Under Ottoman rule, legal and political
factors seriously restricted the availability of privately
owned land and therefore the development of a proper market
'The plain of Levadeia, dominated by cotton cultivation, constituted an exception which rather confirms the rule: private property deeds were reqJestec only in the case of intensive commercialized cultures, though in the rest of the Kingdom, local societies remained for long reluctant to introduce full property rights on the land they cultivated. As late as in the 1930s, in Central Greece, there were stil vil:ages cultivating cereals with the system of "open fie:os" (see Anagnostopoulos & Anagnostopoulos [1939]).

where land could be freely exchanged.
According to Koranic law, the supreme source of any
official legislation until the establishment of the
independent Greek state in 1830, all land belonged to the
Sultan and could only be ceded to individuals during their
life, on condition that they would look after it faithfully.
ln the course of the centuries, this theoretically
inalienable quality of the land became in part a dead letter.
Muslim religious institutions, local Turkish dignitaries, the
Greek church and Greek notables gradually brought
considerable portions of the Sultan's estates into their
virtually unconditional possession. 3 But the legal status of
these quasi-privately owned lands had never been fully
defined or clearly established. 4 As a result, persons wishing
to acquire property rights were obliged to follow complex
procedures in order to obtain them. 5
3For a detailed discussion of the land regime in the Ottoman Empire during the 17th and 18th centuries, see McGowan [ 1981].
'As late as 1819, the Ottoman judicial authorities of Patras tried to apply a "firman" (decree of the Sublime Porte) prescribing that estate property of dying Christians was a property of the Ottoman government. Rich christian notables of Patras found themselves obliged to bribe the local magistrate magnanimously in order to secure the suspension of the deciee (see Triantaf~llou [1959] p.189).
'A rich collection of pre-1830 property certificates of currant vineyards is contained in the J. Papadiamantopoulos archive, file 7873. Their study reveals the complexity of the procedure which had to be followed in order to ensure the legitimacy of the act: the contract was drawn up in front of the authorities o: the Greek community and with the approval of the Greek church. Then the el:er would report the transaction to the Turkish judicial authorities, which ssuec the property title called tapi. In some cases, an additional document was ssued by the Turkish fiscal autr.orities (hontzeti).

79
b. The question of the "National Estates" and the "Law for
the endowment of Greek families" of 1835.
On the departure of the Turks and according to the
international treaties that regulated the establishment of
the Greek state, the latter succeeded to the Ottomans as the
exclusive legitimate inheritor of all their possessions. All
land previously belonging to the Sultan or to local Turkish
dignitaries and religious institutions was transferred to the
Greek government and was given the particular legal status of
"National Estates".
The "National Estates" originally appeared as a formidable
occasion for introducing a general land reform which might
have changed the fortunes of the Greek economy and society.
In fact, the distribution of the "National Estates", combined
with the creation of a national banking system; constituted
the fundamental project of the first governor of Greece,
Capodistria, who aimed at the reconstruction of agriculture
and the establishment of the new state. 6 But following his
assassination in 1830, these plans were definitively
'For a concise and clear interpretation of the efforts of the first governor of Greece, Capodistria, to found his agricultural policy on the distribu~~on of the national lands, see Dertilis [1988], pp.42-46.

80
abandoned. 7
A serious complication was that the "National Estates"
served as a guarantee to the international loans contracted
in 1824 and 1825 by the leaders of the nationalist
insurrection. In order to provide funds for the amortization
of the "revolutionary" loans and of the 60,000,000 francs
loan "of Independence'', advanced by the protecting powers as
a means for the consolidation of the first loans and for the
reconstruction of the country after the devastating war of
1821-1830, 8 the vice-royalty which governed Greece in the
name of King Otto enacted the law of 1835 "for the endowment
of Greek families with land". 9 According to this law, all
family heads were entitled to buy land in public auction by
using a promissory note of 2. 000 drachma nominal value
granted to them by the government, payable in 36 annuities,
each equal to 6%. The lands purchased in this way were
exonerated from the tithe, in place of which a 3% acreage tax
was introduced. 10 The revenues were ended to cover the
'According to approximate estimates, the "National Estates'' represented no less than the third of the cultivated land of the kingdom and half the cultivable land. In the fertile plains of the Peloponnese, national land covered a much higher share of the total cultivable surface.

servicing and the reimbursement of the international debt.
In most respects, the law of 1836 proved a complete
failure. The response of the public was not at all
enthusiastic; the amount of land effectively put to auction
was very 1 imited, and government revenues from it proved
totally disappointing, not even reaching 40,000 drachmas
(less than 36,000 francs) in any single year of the period
1835-1840. Until 1871, no more than 14,500 hectares were sold
under the endowment law throughout the kingdom, and no more
than 9,133 acts of cession were issued. 11
c. The reasons for the failure of the "endowment" project.
The Bavarian bureaucrats of the vice-royalty, principal
authors of the "endowment" project, committed a fundamental
mistake in their otherwise enlightened calculations: they
simply did not take into account the demographic and socio
economic relations dominating the early 19th century Greek
countryside, which were totally unfavourable to the kind of
10 ( ••• cent inued)
westernizing modernize~s. Its indiscriminate incidence acLed as a disincent~ve to land improvements, punishing investment in long-terrr. increases in productivity. Even the ministers of finance themselves, wnen i!",C.roduc :-',g i::_ to parliament during the discussions of the annual budget, always had a word to say against its anachron stic nature, while postponing its abol tion till the future, when better financial circumstances would exist. The tithe tax was f i:<a:ly abolished in 1880.
"See Stefanidis [ 1948 J p. 81-86 (referred by Psihogios [ 1987] p. 68, :-'.. lC)).

82
changes essential for the success of the law of 1835.
The greatest part of the "National Estates" were situated
in the fertile, but still deserted and unhealthy plains.
Prices sanctioned in the "endowment" law auctions would have
been relatively cheap for holdings subjected to intense
cultivation and whose fertility was conserved through
manuring or crop rotation. But under the prevailing primitive
technological conditions, unreclaimed land had scarcely any
market value at all. The purchase of "national" land and the
cost of the yearly instalments could be worthwhile only if
accompanied by considerable land improvements; whereas any
price paid for open fields cultivated once every three or
four years would prove excessive. 12 The same was true for the
acreage tax, which could be really beneficial to a
systematically cultivated and productive holding, yet
constituted a disproportionate burden on estates exploited in
an extremely extensive fashion.
The kind of "enclosures" proposed by the endowment law
presupposed a radical transformation of the prevailing

''Whitebled [1886] p.212 reported that in 1885 still, that is more than nalf a century after the introduction of the "endowment" law, arable land was usually sowed once every two years. And the anonymous translator of the Efimeris cis Ellinikis Georqias corrected him by saying that in most cases, arable :ana was cultivated once every three years (p.212, n.2).

considerable capital and labour inputs. However, the latter
were hardly available at the time, because of both the
ravages of the long war of Independence and the chronic
depopulation of the country, dating back many centuries. 14 The
law of 1835 provided for the supply of the only factor of
production that already existed in relative abundance, namely
land, and therefore had no chance by itself of provoking the
desired transformations.
d. Currant growing provinces: the exception.
As suggested above, the currant growing provinces and
particularly that of Patras, constituted a major and
significant exception to the widespread failure of the
endowment project: more than half the total sales of national
land under the law of 1835 was concentrated in the currant
growing districts. In 1836 alone, the value of the land sold
in the currant-growing district of Patras amounted to 713,210
drachmas, out of 1,459,254 for the entire kingdom. The total
value of the national land sold in Patras province up to 1838
amounted to 1,173,592 drachmas, which was by far the highest
figure for any single province of the kingdom and

corresponded to more than 2, 0 00 ha. 15 Later on, state land
purchases under the "endowment" scheme became important also
in the currant growing provinces of the western Peloponnese,
Ilia and Trifilia. 16
In practice, currant viticulture was at the time the only
agricultural sector which could easily attract the capital
resources required for the success of the endowment scheme.
Moreover, it was the only sector in urgent need of privately
owned land, since permanent and expensive improvements
connected to currant planting could not be developed under
conditions of insecurity of property rights. 17
The remarkable success of the endowment project in the
currant-growing provinces, diametrically opposed to its
clamorous failure in the rest of the kingdom, underlines the
revolutionary change that the expansion of currant
cultivation represented for the traditional ways of land

On the importance of the endowment law for the expansion of currant viticultwre, see Mansolas Politeioqrafikai ... , p.72: "After the publication of the endowment law, facilitating the transfer of a considerable share of national land to the citizens' property, currant cultivation entered a new era ....

17Abusive planting on state-owned land was practised only by petty growers; bigger investors usually avoided undertaking such a risk, with the exception of a few potentates who enjoyed immunity because of their close connections wit~ the government in Athens (seeS. Petmezas [1990], p.23, n.24). In 1860, out- of 15,306 ha of currant- vineyards, those planted on state land were 4,695, or 30.67%, when in most currant growing provinces, cultivated National Estates represented almost two thirds of total cultivated land.

exploitation. On the other hand, the responsiveness of the
currant-growing provinces to the massive sale of land
permitted by the law of 1835 shows clearly how important the
latter was for the further expansion of currant viticulture:
in the period 1845-1847, when the first vineyards which had
been planted on "endowment" lands carne into full maturity,
the currant production of the Peloponnese recorded its
highest 19th century growth rates, increasing by 66% in two
years (1845 to 1847) . 18
e. The law of 1871 for the distribution of the National
Estates.
The success of the endowment project in the few provinces
producing currants already in the 1830s could not of course
counteract its failure in the rest of Greece. This failure,
by destroying any hopes of collecting the necessary funds,
definitely contributed to the decision of the government to
suspend the regular servicing of the foreign debt from 1837,
As a result, the question of the "National Estates" carne to
a halt and any solution had to be postponed until the final
settlement of the debt, which remained suspended until a

86
compromise was reached between Greece and its foreign
creditors in 1878. 19
However, irrespective of the legal complications of the
question, anyone could sow a smaller or larger parcel of
national land by just paying a rent to the public treasury. 20
As pointed out by McGrew, the government was "largely
powerless to dispose of the bulk of the holdings for its own
needs or in ways which ran counter to the interests of those
who exercised practical control over them, namely their
traditional occupants, usurpers, squatters and local power
brokers. "21 Moreover, a law of 1845 expressly guaranteed the
inviolability of peasant holdings, recognizing what was
already an everyday practice. 22
A major change to this state of affairs occurred with the
application of the law of 1871 "for the distribution of the
national lands". This law decreed that all occupants of
national lands should declare the exact area, location and
"See Dertilis, op.cit., pp.70-79. Very probably, the coincidence of the debt consolidation of 1878 with the first issue of "cessions" of nationa~ ho~dings to private individuals, notwithstanding that the respective law had been passed already in 1871 (see the first volumes of the chronologically ordered Lists of cessions of the National Estates enabled by the law o 431 of 1871), is noL accidental.

boundaries of the occupied holdings, for any amount of land
up to 80 stremmata. 23 Subsequently, the occupants were to
redeem the occupied holdings at their estimated market price,
payable in 26 yearly instalments at 3% amortization and 2%
interest rate. The price was officially determined by a
special committee set up by the local municipal, financial
and administrative authorities. After payment of the first
instalment, the declared holding was considered private and
consequently absolved from the obligation of paying the
"usufruct" tax. The owner received an official 11 cess ion 11
document, which was equivalent to a full ownership title. Any
occupant omitting the declaration or the disbursement of the
instalments would lose his rights to the occupied holding,
which in that case could be sold without any restriction and
by the same procedure to any aspiring purchaser. Greek
citizens not occupying national lands had the right to claim
unoccupied holdings and could buy them according to the same
procedures.
The law of 1871 "for the distribution of the national
lands" was considerably more effective than had been its
predecessor endowment law of 1835. Between 1878 and 1911,
357,217 cessions were issued, distributing about 265,000 ha
of national land; their estimated value amounted to
"One stremma ~s equal to l,OOO sq.m. or l/10 of a hectare.

90, 0 0 0, 0 0 0 drachmas. 24 These 2 65, 0 0 0 hectares represented
38,5% of all cultivated land in 1860 and 31,7% of all
cultivated land in 1911. 25 Most of the holdings were
"declared" (the first step to legal possession) in the period
1871-1885. The issue of the first cession certificates
dragged on until 18 78, probably due to the uncertainty
concerning Greece's obligations towards its foreign
creditors, definitively removed with the compromise achieved
in that same year. 26
Undoubtedly an important factor which contributed to the
relative success of the 1871 law, as suggested by McGrew, was
"the element of coercion it introduced by abolishing the 1843
law which tolerated squatters on the one hand and, on the
other, by making farms held without legal title vulnerable to
the purchase rights of other parties". 27 Possession rights
over national holdings had always been transferable and

I checked and reconfirmed the calculations of Anastasiadis, which were probably based on the "general register of cessions of national land", found in the general accountancy service of the state and microfilmed for the HANBG under the supervision of Eve Karousou.
"Total cultivated land (including fallow land) of the Pelopo:".nese and of Continental Greece - the two major departments of the kingdom wh!cn contained all national land - was 688,300 ha in 1860 and 835,600 in 19l:l. For soc:rces, see n.19, chapter I.

protected to a
considerable degree the direct cultivators from overt
seizure. In this respect, the built-in "element of coercion"
of the law of 1871 constituted a deep break with the Ottoman
tradition of inalienability of peasant holdings.
However, the relative success of the 1871 law was
principally due to the increase in population density and to
the advance of commercialisation which had taken place since
the introduction of the endowment law of 1835. The limits of
McGrew's argument are illustrated by the repetitive
modifications of the 18 71 law, which continued to invite
holders of national land to declare it until as late as 1890.
Only part of the state-owned lands were finally sold, and
most of them were found in provinces presenting an advanced
degree of commercialisation (see graph II.1). If the
principal reason for the success of the land distribution had
been that peasants were afraid of being evicted from the land
they traditionally cultivated, national land purchases would
have been much more evenly distributed.
On the other hand, as stated in the p.tevious chapter,
migrant peasants settled precisely in those regions where
sales of national land were most massive - namely the currant

access to land, peasant families would have preferred to
settle elsewhere. Moreover, it is certain that plenty of non
declared lands continued to be available until long after the
application of the 1871 law.

property titles during the first period of continuous spread

state land into currant vineyards in 1871-1892 under the "Law
for the distribution of the National Estates" was a
phenomenon of unprecedented magnitude. The voting of the law
in 1871 coincided chronologically with the start of the major
period of vigorous, continuous and widespread currant
expansion. Moreover, the provinces where most vineyards were
planted in 1870-1892 happened to be precisely those plains of
western and southern Peloponnese where there existed the
greatest concentrations of "National Estates". 29

greatly contributed to the expansion of currant viticulture. 30
In fact, in the three first years of its application (1872
1874), currant vineyards increased by 9.3% yearly, which was
the highest ra~e of growth of currant vineyard acreage in the
second half of the 19th century. Between 1871 and 1893, more
than 30,000 ha of currant vineyards were planted; 31 according
to all indications, most vineyards in the post-1871
Peloponnese were planted on national lands, and most holdings
were purchased for the purpose of planting currant vineyards.
B. Distribution of National Estates, concentration of
landownership, and farm consolidation: the case of Amalias.
Currant growing represented a very intensive use of the
land; it required close supervision, both of the vines and of
those who cultivated them. It also required infrastructure of
a kind which offered considerable economies of scale:
threshing-floors, buildings, fences, irrigation and draining
facilities. Extensive and consolidated farms- at least, say,
30 Cfr. eg. Hairetis [1883] p.387 and p.431; Lamprinidis [1905] p.l4; s:ae.c;_s [1934] p.78. As stated by the British consul in Patras, "in consequence of a law passed in the year 1871, granting favourable conditions to the purchasers of national land, no less than 100,000 acres of land have been bought since that date by Greek citizens, part being covered with bushes which have been burnt and cleared, and the remainder of pasture land, well adapted for planting currant vineyards ... Of the above mentioned land, a large portion is being planted with currants, so that we may look for a great increase in their production when the vines come into full bearing." (BRCREP 1876).
31 See chapter I, p.27.

93
10 ha large - could meet these requirements in a much more
effective way than could farms made up of tiny plots
scattered around the village.
The law of. 1871 "for the distribution of the National
Estates", which coincided with the start of the major period
of continuous currant expansion (1871-1893), was an excellent
opportunity for creating large and consolidated estates. The
distribution of the national lands favoured concentration of
landownership and farm consolidation, since previously
uncertain possession rights over land were fixed for the
first time in a definitive way and since it represented a
generalized and simultaneous offer of sale of both cultivated
and unreclaimed fields. 32
In order to examine the procedure of distribution of state
lands and of their conversion into currant vineyard farms, I
chose the case of the small town of Amalias, once a
flourishing provincial centre of currant production and
trade. Suggestions and observations presented here are in
large part the outcome of detailed nominative research in the
archives of this town.
32 A clear sign of a rapidly expanding agriculture and of changing ways of land exploitation, many parcels of national land are described in the list of cessions as "bordering on the forest", "bordering on the swamp" or "bordering on ~nreclaimed national lands''.

94
a. Problems in the use of the sources and attempted
solutions.
The two principal sources consulted are the official list
which records all the cessions of national land which was
distributed according to the procedures of the 1871 law, and
the estate property transactions register, which contains
copies of all contracts which record acts relating to estate
property.
The list of cessions presents the advantage of lending
itself to quantitative analysis and is exhaustively used here
in order to test the hypothesis of land concentration and
plot consolidation connected with the distribution of the
National Estates. However, as proved by an inquiry into the
estate property transactions register, distributed plots were
quite often transferred to other persons immediately after
declaration, long before the completion of the cession. In
such cases, the real purchaser of the plot was not the person
who initially declared it, but rather the one to whom the
rights on the plot were transferred. In cases where the
transfer was communicated early enough to the ministry of the
Interior, the cession document was issued in the name of the
real purchaser. But more often than not, the cession was
issued in the name of the initial declarer, and its transfer

95
to the new owner only took place afterwards. 33 As a result,
the plot was recorded in the list of cessions as belonging to
the initial declarer and not to the real purchaser. 34
In theory, it would be possible to discover the precise
allocation of all plots of national land distributed in
Amalias, because all consecutive transfers of distributed
plots were minutely recorded in the estate property
transactions register. But this would have required
consultation of all the contracts of all persons appearing on
the cession lists, an operation forbiddingly demanding in
terms of time and resources. 35
"See e.g. TR 19/83-5/12/1877: "Joannis Markopoulos, peasant from Roviata, sells to Anagnostis At. Dalianis, mayor of Ilis, 20 stremmata in Agios Atanasios, which he declared in the 31st of August of this year in the declarations register of the village of Roviata ... He promises that if the cession is to be issued in his name, he will transfer it to A.A.Dalianis (emphasis added).
"The list of cessions of Amalias records only 22 cases of transfer of rights. But inquiry into the estate property transaction cont.racts of just 4 notables revealed another 22 transfers, none of them recorded in t.he list. of cessions. Consequently, we may safely assume that more often chan not, t:he transfer of rights over national land was not registered in the list of cessions and that constituted a much more common practice than would appear from exclusive consideration of the number of transfers registered in that: list..
35Similar problems were encountered by scholars of the sale of the "Biens Nationaux" confiscated during the French Revolution. For a presentation of the questions relevant to the French case, we may quote here Lefebre [1963], pp.308309: "Qui done, en definitive, a surtout profite de la vente? Ceux qui travaillaient la terre ou les autres? Les paysans qui etaient deja proprietaires ou ceux qui le voulaient devenir? Faut-il, d'ailleurs, sur ce point en croire 2es actes de vente?

Yet, however similar the questions may (continued ... )

96
A sample was formed instead, containing a limited number
of persons, and the full corpus of their contracts recorded
on the register was studied in detail. It is comforting that
the results of this latter inquiry do not contradict, but
rather confirm the conclusions of the quantitative analysis
based on the list of cessions.
b. Plot fragmentation and farm consolidation in Amalias.
(1) Consolidation by kin.
According to the list of cessions of the 1871 law, 937
cession certificates were issued for state land distributed
in the Amalias district. 36 As a result of these certificates,
" ( ... continued) be between the French and Greek cases, a major difference exists as regards the availability and organisation of the archives in the two countries: it is very difficult, not to say impossible for the historian of the Greek case to ar~:ve at figures of a precision comparable to those of his French colleague. A major d:fficulty in the case of Greece is the absence of an organized "cadastre'', which would easily permit one to follow the changes of prope~ty of the National Sstates afte~ their first sale recorded in the list of cess ons - often deceptive in France and Greece alike. Another serious problem is the deplorable condition of the indexes of the Transactions Register (Vivlio Metaqrafon): the study of any single contract requires recourse to its full text, to be found in severa~ volumes, often partly in a state of decomposition, without any possibility of getting any previous information about its contents, because contracts are indexed only by first name and surname of the contractors. These difficulties seriously limit the number of cases which can be studied in a given period of time, making practically impossible the full counting of all cases and imposing the use of indirect techniques of calculation.
"Distribution of state land planted prior to the enactment of the 1871 distribution project was dealt with according to a special law ( aw 386 of l87l) and cession certificates concerning "National Plantations" were recor-ciec ir; a separate list. Out of 937 cession certificates issc;ed for the distric: o: Amalias, 91 fell under this latter category. However, in the present study no distinction is made between uncultivated and planted state land and both kinds of cession certificates are considered together.
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


97
1,304 plots of land were assigned, covering a total area of
16,518 stremmata (1,651.8 ha) . 37 The average number of plots
per cession certificate was 1.39 and a single certificate
might refer to up to 5 separate plots of land. Plots ranged
between one and 80 stremmata, their average size being 12.61
stremmata. The division of the total area of national land
distributed in Amalias is shown, by size of plot, in graph
II. 3.
The first impression is one of extreme land fragmentation;
58% of distributed state land consisted of plots of less than
20 stremmata and plots of less than 40 stremmata covered 81%
of total area. Inquiry into the location and boundaries of
plots described in the cession certificates however proved
that plots assigned to persons belonging to the same
patrilineal kin (identified through common surname) were
usually neighbouring with each other and tended to form
larger contiguous blocks.
A test was then carried out in order to search for
patrilineal kin groups collectively possessing clusters of
plots of at least 20 stremmata: 162 out of 310 groups of
37 Amal1as was formed by the unification of two formerly separa:e v~:~ages, Dervitselepi and Kalitsa. Their territory, although bordering, ls se~ac:a:.e~y referred t:o in the list: of cessions. The administrative bounaaries of tne :.wo villages are however considered here as one, since by the ~idd:e cf t::o,e :9:'-: cen Jry the process of their CJnification was fully completed. Nevec:t:he'ess, off c~al statistics and other sources continue t:o refer to them separately til~ as ate as 1879 (eg. see Houliarakis [1974]).

choice. Such contiguous areas made up of several plots of
national land probably formed either a single farm or several
farms which were complementary from the point of view of
productive organization. Consolidation of plots belonging to
a group of close relatives probably also signified
cooperation of these latter in the tasks of cultivation and
collective access to infrastructural works such as wells,
storing houses, pathways, etc. 40
(2) Consolidation and risk.
Another observation arising from this investigation of
property boundaries is that in most cases where a kin group
held land in several localities, almost all members of the
group used to hold land in each of them. Most probably, by so
doing they combined advantages of economies of scale offered
by farm consolidation with advantages of spread of risk
brought about by possession of farms located on different
qualities of soil, asymmetrically affected by weather and

climate variations. Currant vines planted on hilly grounds
were favoured in years of abundant rain, when those planted
on the heavy and fertile soils of the low plain were
suffering from extreme humidity; the latter yielded better
quality fruit in times of drought. 41
(3) Land fragmentation before the distribution of the
National Estates.
The question remains however why national lands in
Arnalias, although forming larger consol idated farms, were
referred to in the cession certificates in the form of so
many and so tiny plots. Where a contiguous area was
attributed to the same person with several cession
certificates, as consisting of various plots, one might
assume that the purchaser claimed these plots at different
dates simply because he preferred to spread over time the
payments of deposit and instalments. Yet this does not
provide an explanation for parts of the same holding claimed
by a single person, with a single declaration, which
corresponded to a single cession certificate. And more often
than not, assigned plots registered in one and the same

cession certificate bordered on each other. 42
The only likely answer is that neighbouring pieces of land
appearing as separate in the cession certificates had in the
past been occupied by different persons and that at the time
of the distribution of the National Estates aspiring
purchasers managed, through exchange or purchase, to
consolidate them into fewer plots. Acceptance of this
suggestion might also explain why the procedure of
declarations lasted several years: indeed, the conclusion of
so many exchanges of plots must have been a rather time
consuming operation. Although there can be no direct evidence
of such a generalized procedure of exchanges aiming at farm
consolidation since occupants scarcely ever produced
written contracts concerning the possession, sale or exchange
of ill-defined legal rights over national land one can
rightly conclude that separate registration of neighbouring
pieces of land belonging to a single owner provides a trace
of the fragmentation of property prevailing in Amalias prior
to the distribution of the National Estates. 43
' 2Another explanation could have been that the distinction between parts of a contiguous plot was an effort to define in a more accurate way its boundaries and location. But this explanation is irrelevant, because the description c~ the plots claimed used to be very approximative. Boundaries were referred to by just stating the name or the family of the owner of some neighbouring plot, or ir. reference to physical obstacles (a river, a hill, t:he sea etc.).
"Farm fragmentation is considered typical of subsistence and technologica.:.ly backward agriculture, as was the Peloponnesian prior to the spread o~ currant monoculture. See McCloskey, ibidem.

103
c. Strategies of estate property concentration: who benefited
from the distribution of the National Estates?
(1) The choice of patrilineal kin as a level for analysis.
The primary unit of social and economic life in
traditional societies - such as in 19th century Peloponnese
- was the family, not the individual; consolidation of plots
belonging to members of the same patrilineal kin, discovered
during the investigation of property boundaries, is a
consequence of this fact. In assessing the level of
concentration of the National Estates, there would be little
sense in considering the plots assigned to a son separately
from those assigned to his father, brother or wife, when
there are clear indications that all of them collaborated
closely in the cultivation and management of property.
The ideal measure of the degree of land concentration
wouJd be to compare the area assigned to each family to the
size of this latter at the moment of distribution. But such
a calculation is not possible, because material for
reconstructing family composition is simply not available.
Two alternative ways exist for estimating the degree of
concentration which characterized the distribution of the
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


104
National Estates. One is to calculate how much land was
assigned to each person appearing in the list of cessions,
assuming that individual purchasers were also heads of
families; the second is to calculate how much land was
assigned to each patrilineal kin group, that is to each group
of persons bearing the same family name.
The study of national land concentration by individual
purchasers, referring to single families, might give us a
more precise image. Yet this solution presents serious
drawbacks. Purchases of National Land were spread over
several years. No doubt, most of them took place in the
1870s; but at least some occurred in the 1880s and (probably
very few) in the 1890s. Even if we accept that national land
was usually claimed by the head of the family, one and the
same family might have acquired land in the name of more than
one successive family leader. Moreover, a family wishing to
acquire more than 80 stremmata might declare land in the name
of several of its members, in order to circumvent the upper
limit established by the 1871 law. 44
"The 595 purchasers of national land in Amalias (individualized :.r.roc.gi-: common first name, family name and- wherever recorded- father's name) can thus by no means be identified with the heads of the 600 families which, according to the 1879 census of population, lived in Amalias at that date (population i:-1 1879 amounted to 2,833 and the average family size in c.he demos of =:.is was 4. 5 persons per family). The region moreover experienced quick population growth dCJe to in-migration. Ten years later, in 1889, there were 50% more inhabitants, that is no less than 300 more families. Although it is true t.hat new settlers, ;wt possessing the status of ancient occupant, did not fully participate in the distribution of the National Estates, we cannot exclude that some of them (probably a few) did purchase national lands. A further complication is that rich merchants and notables of neighbouring towns also bought some National Lands in that district, in order to invest in currant. vineyards. Their number must have (continued ... )

105
Besides this, information offered by the list of cessions
is not sufficient to provide an accurate identification of
individual purchasers. In Greece it is a tradition to name
the eldest male children after the name of the paternal
grandfather; two brothers' eldest sons often bear the same
first name and the only way to avoid confusion would be to
know the name of the father. But most cession certificates do
not record this latter information. As a result, risk of
homonymy is high.
As against these limitations, analysis on the basis of
surnames presents advantages which strongly recommend it. The
consol idat ic of plots belonging to members of the same
patrilineal kin discovered during the investigation of
property boundaries has demonstrated that patrilineal kin
constituted an organic entity of ownership of property in
land and consequential organization of production. Moreover,
there were extremely few probabilities for people possessing
neighbouring plots of land and bearing the same surname to
belong to unrelated kin groups. As a result,
individualization of patrilineal kin leaves little ambiguity.

106
(2) Land concentration by patrilineal kin.
A test for land concentration at patrilineal kin level
proves that the distribution of the National Estates in
Amalias was markedly unequal. 70.32% of kin groups received
less than the average amount of land ceded per kin group (53
stremmata) . As shown in table I I. 1, almost half ( 4 8. 1%) of
the 310 groups got less than 20 stremmata each; this
corresponded to only a tenth of the total distributed area.
On the other hand, the "richest" 16.8% of kin groups received
58.4% of land.
It would be possible to advance an interpretation of the
above figures based on a model similar to that of Chayanov, 45
by assuming that the amount of land assigned to patrilineal
kin groups was proportionate to the number, size and
developmental cycle of families which belonged to it. In such
a case, the unequal distribution of national lands to kin
groups would be concealing a more equal per capita
distribution. The data do not, however, support this
hypothesis. There is no reason to support that the size of
patrilineal kin groups was not normally distributed, or that
kin groups of average size were more numerous than kin groups
of minimum and maximum size. If the assigned area was highly

correlated with kin group size, kin groups receiving average
amounts of national land should be more numerous than those

kin groups according to the purchased area, illustrated in

stratification.

This "upper class" sample was defined with· the aid of the
following sources:
a) The lists of clients of the Pirgos branch of the National
Bank of Greece, responsible at that time for the territory of

109
Amalias and the surrounding villages. These lists, available
for the period 1870-1878, included 32 family names also
appearing in the National Estates' cessions list of Amalias. 46
Access to credit from the only official banking institution
existing at that time was restricted to big farmers, notables
and merchants; as a result, participation in the clientele of
the Bank is a sure indication of the non-peasant identity of
a family. 47
b) A collection of 189 contracts from notarial archives of
Amalias, covering the currant seasons 1877-1882. These 189
contracts were selected out of about 700 consulted, on the
grounds of their relevance to currant production and trade. 48
People who appear in them as creditors of the peasantry,
employers and rich landowners, were considered to belong to
the "upper class". Many of them also figured in the lists of
the National Bank. This source enriched our sample with
another 19 family names (not appearing in the group of
National Bank's customers, although some of their close
relatives - bearing a different family name - did).

stremmata, or an average of 134.36 stremmata. This figure is
2. 5 times greater than the average area assigned to the
entire set of the 310 kin groups and 3.6 times greater than
the average area assigned to the 259 kin groups not included
in the "upper class" sample.
The kin groups included into our "upper class" sample,
although forming only 16.5% of kin groups which received
land, purchased no less than 41.5% of the total area of
National Estates assigned in Amalias. And we must bear in
mind that the sample is by no means an exhaustive list of the
rich and powerful families in the small town. 49 There is no
reason to assume that well-off families not included in it
behaved in a different way. Very probably, most national land
purchased in greater than average lots was acquired by the
upper strata of the small town.

111
(4) Transfer of peasants' rights on national land in favour
of members of the elite.
There are moreover strong indications that the list of
cessions significantly underestimates the upper class's share
of National Estates. As noted above, distributed plots were
often transferred right after declaration, long before the
completion of the cession. In particular, such transfers
usually occurred in favour of members of the elite. Inquiry
into the estate property transaction register of Amalias
proves that notables were widely engaged in the purchase of
peasants' rights on national land: they convinced peasants
(or other citizens not interested or not possessing the means
to utilize their rights to 80 stremmata of national land) to
sign a contract selling them the area which these latter had
just "declared" according to the procedures established by
the law of 1871. At the same time the new owner assumed the
responsibility for paying the remaining instalments to the
government.
More often than not, the list of cessions records the
original declarer and not the person to whom the rights on
the plot were transferred, and who should be considered as
the real purchaser. Hence, many plots in reality purchased by
members of the elite, were recorded in the list of cessions
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


112
as if purchased by others and are not included in the above
presented estimates of the elite's share.
On the other hand, and not surprisingly, no transaction
was found in the register of national land going in the
opposite direction; that is, no peasant family appears to
have bought national land declared by a notable, with the
very rare exception of some minute plots, never greater than
5 stremmata. In fact, peasants had no interest in buying
national land "declared" by other people, since if they
wished they could declare it themselves, profiting from the
convenient rates of payment by instalments of the 1871 Law.
Although it is not feasible to trace the precise
allocation of all plots of national land distributed in
Amalias, 50 the above inquiries provide sufficient support for
a general conclusion: rural rich and notable families managed
to get possession of a large part of the distributed National
Estates. This conclusion runs contrary to the assumption
commonly accepted up to now in Greek historiography. 51
50 See above, p.96.
51 See p.2 of the introduction. However, D. K. Psihogios [1987] p.72, who used the archives of the Mortgage Hall of Lehena in order to provide figures for the composition and evolution of dowries (see chapter VI, below) reports that only wealthy farm owners and merchants appear to have "declared" more than l to 2 hectares of national land and notes the existence of contracts transferring rights on national land to wealthy people who wished to invest in currant vineyards.

113
d. The example of some individual notables.
The study of land concentration by kin, performed with the
aid of the list of cessions, offered the advantage of
covering the entire area distributed in Amalias. But land
concentration strategies emerge still more explicitly from
the study of the land purchase policies of individual
notables. For this purpose, a limited number of cases of
wealthy farmers was studied in detail and the full corpus of
contracts appearing under their name in the estate property
transactions register of Amalias were consulted.
Out of these individual cases studied in detail, two were
mayors of the demos of Ilis; the others were a doctor, a
lawyer from Pirgos, a currant merchant, three farm-owners
(ktimaties). They all, at least occasionally, practised
money-lending and were customers of the National Bank. Many
of their close relatives did likewise: they were also
merchants, notaries, doctors, magistrates and farm-owners.
Concentration of extensive areas of national lands was
common to all cases studied. Anagnostis Dalianis, deputy to
the National Parliament, purchased as many as 797 stremmata;
his nephew Leonidas Galanopoulos, doctor, 837 st remmata.
Together they obtained a concentrated area equal to almost
10% of all national lands distributed in Arnalias. Aristeidis
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


114
Harvalos, currant merchant, purchased 450 stremmata and
Theodoros Papailiou, lawyer from Pirgos, 240 stremmata. The
examples could be multiplied at will, since there seems to
have been sca~cely any head of a notable family not tempted
by the opportunity of national land consolidation.
Most of this land was concentrated by buying up the rights
of other beneficiaries of the 1871 Law. 85% of the land
purchased by Anagnostis Dalianis came from such indirect
purchases. The relative percentage for L. Galanopoulos was
88%, for A. Harvalos 100%, for Th. Papailiou 67%.
Although it is impossible to calculate with precision how
much of this land was planted with currant vines, we may
conclude that most of it was. The contracts show that
A. Dalianis converted at least 320 stremmata into vineyards;
A. Harvalos planted the entire area he purchased (450
stremmata); Th. Papailiou planted at least 160 out of the 240
stremmata he purchased.
They all kept purchased national lands as for long as
possible and none tried to speculate by selling them
immediately after purchase. Unless the land was seized by
creditors in times of hardship, it was inherited by
successors or given to daughters as dowry. The only cases of
sales encountered in research were connected to exchanges for
other pieces of land or vineyards, which aimed at farm
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


115
consolidation.
Another conclusion is that most acquisitions of the
notables whose land purchase contracts were studied did not
take place inside the territory of Arnalias, but in that of
the villages surrounding it. 52 For A. Dalianis the relative
percentage was 92%, for L. Galanopoulos 78%, for A. Harvalos
100%. This preference for national land situated in the
territory of neighbouring villages was probably connected to
the fact that these latter were less densely populated than
Arnalias. The fields close to the city had been cultivated for
a very long time, were more fragmented, contained orchards
and peasant dwellings. Unreclaimed land was found in the
neighbourhood of small and newly formed villages rather than
in the outskirts of the small town. This land was well suited
to the purposes of the aspiring currant farmers, who could
thus proceed to the establishment of extensive vineyards by
reclaiming previously uncultivated or fallow land without
meeting any kind of peasant resistance or traditionally
established boundaries.

value of the land, incomparably lower than market rates.
Instalments were also modest: a person who declared his
preference for a certain piece of property would pay 1. 5
drachmas per stremma deposit at the moment of declaration and
3% for amortization over the next 26 years.
However, purchase of national land was not a very
attractive investment (unless if it was used for a particular
purpose, such as the establishment of a vineyard); since
undeclared national land was abundant, the rate of increase
in the value of the declared plots over time was far from
being comparable to interest rates on capital. Somebody who
needed to purchase land, would prefer undeclared state land
to already purchased plots (unless of course he was
interested in a particular plot, e.g. in order to consolidate
his estate) . If he bought an undeclared plot, he would
benefit from the convenient rates; though if he bought a plot
already purchased by somebody else a few years before, he
should pay him for the instalments already disbursed. But it
was better to owe instalments to the state at 2% interest,
than to pay to the owner of a plot a capital sum for former
instalments, at a time when interest rates- on loans often
exceeded 20%. 54 What actually happened was that those who, for
any reason, sold national land already declared, were obliged
"See chapter III, below.

119
to accept prices much lower than the expenses they had
advanced for deposit and instalments up to that moment.
To make an example, let us assume that in the sales of
partly redeemed plots presented in table II.2 the two average
prices calculated for the two groups, 10.4 and 23.25
drachmas, corresponded to the mean lapse of time from
declaration recorded for each of the two groups; that is, to
the second and eleventh year respectively. If somebody bought
a plot for which two yearly instalments were already paid and
sold it again nine years later, he would receive 12.85
drachmas more than he had paid; but during the nine years
from purchase to sale, he would have paid no less than 18
drachmas for instalments. 55
On the grounds of the above considerations, we may
conclude that the prospect of fully redeeming the land 26
years later does not seem to have been a significant
contribution to the increase of the family property.
Consequently, if an occupant of national land did not intend
to plant a vineyard or to make some other permanent
improvement in the plot - he would compare yearly costs of
declaration only with the benefit from the exemption from the
usufruct tax.
"Since he should pay 5% yearly on the value of the land (3% for amortizat~oc. and 2% for interests), which was 40 drachmas.

a. In all cases, the official estimate of the full value of the land was 40 drachmas per stremma.
In Amalias, prices of national land ranged between 25 and
50 drachmas per stremma (0.1 of an hectare): for the sake of
our calculations, let us admit an average of 38 drachmas per
stremma. 56 That is, instalments were on average 1.90 drachmas
per stremma. If we accept that the deposit was paid with
money borrowed at 20% a year the yearly cost of purchasing a
stremma of national land rose to 2.20 drachmas.
The usufruct tax, from which declared plots were exempted,
amounted to 15% of gross product. For a stremma of purchased
national land which cost 2.20 drachmas a year, one would have
paid as much in terms of usufruct tax if its gross output was
valued at 14.66 drachmas. But one should also take into
consideration that land cultivated with cereals was usually
left fallow one year in two (and sometimes even longer) , 57 in
which case the yearly instalment would equally be paid; 2.20

121
drachmas a year for instalments were thus equivalent to
paying "usufruct tax" for gross product amounting at 29.32
drachmas per cultivated stremma.
Cereal cultivation in the district of Arnalias was usually
based on a triennial rotation of maize, wheat and oats; 58
according to the 1864 agricultural census, the average gross
output of these three crops was calculated at 18.82 drachmas
per stremma, 59 definitely less than what was required to
render "declaration" of national land directly advantageous.
Moreover, the 1864 census calculation, based on market
prices, rather overestimated the real monetary yield of the
land, since hardly ever did the peasants get from the sale of
their product the full price the market was ready to pay. As
against this, "usufruct tax" was payable in kind, not
obliging peasants to provide for the commercialization of
their crop.
Being proportional to real yields, this tax in kind also
presented considerable advantages of flexibility. In regions
where currant growing had assumed dimensions of monoculture,
cereals were attributed a secondary importance. During peak
periods of cultivation, works in the vineyards were

considered more urgent than those for other crops and
especially maize, the cultivation of which coincided with
that of currants. As a result, cereal yields, besides
variations depending on the weather, were also conditioned by
time availabilities of cultivators, only allocating to these
crops the time left over from currant growing. 60 Obligations
ensuing from the purchase of national lands were instead
fixed in time and totally independent of the degree to which
the field was cultivated, to the harvest it yielded, to
whether or not the peasant possessed the implements
indispensable for cultivation. 61
In conclusion, it seems that the cost of deposit and
instalments to the Public Treasury was not worth paying for
lands intermittently and extensively cultivated. The purchase
of national lands appears to have been rewarding only to
those who also possessed adequate means to intensively
exploit them, in particular to convert them into currant
vineyards.
But currant cultivation was a very expensive occupation,
especially in terms of fixed capital. The establishment of
'"In several share-cropping agreements for arable fields, tenants were left the choice "to sow with maize as many stremmata as they could affo:cd" (e.g. cn.6302-5/ll/1880,cn.6329-13/ll/1880) since it was probably difficult to convince them to commit an inflexible part of their activity to what was considered a secondary task. In other share-cropping agreements, probably for t!le same reasons, a high penalty was stipulated for share-croppers who neglected cultivation of part of the field.

vineyards was a long-term investment, since it involved the
commitment of considerable amounts of land, labour and
capital inputs, which would only produce a return at a
distance of several years. The currant vine only started to
bear any fruit five years after it was planted, was becoming
profitable in its seventh year and did not fully reach
maturity before its tenth or twelfth year of age.
The cost of any profitable use of purchased national lands
was thus inaccessible to peasant families, which therefore
limited their purchases in the tiny plots they were able to
intensively cultivate by planting a few trees, some vines or
by creating small orchards. Conversely, the live interest of
"upper class" families in concentrating large areas of
national lands was connected to the fact that they were able
and interested in financing the creation of extensive currant
vineyards.

Chapter III. The predominance of merchant capital over the
currant sector.
The influx of credit from foreign markets, from the
exporting ciries and the national banking system was the
principal motive force for the important changes connected
with the development of the currant trade. As was argued in
chapter I, immigration to the coastal plains of the
Peloponnese appears to have been determined mainly by the
relative availability of capital resources; and as was shown
in chapter II, the concentration of landownership and
consolidation of farms effected by the local elites in
currant growing provinces were to a large extent financed
with borrowed funds.
The economic instability that characterized the centuries
preceding the establishment of the Greek state, followed by
the complete devastation of the country during the long War
of Independence and the civil strife that ensued, left few
fortunes intact and few resources available for investment.
Locally accumulated wealth was by no means sufficient to
finance the spectacular growth of the currant trade. The main
form of credit available to currant viticulture was that
supplied by the merchant networks which controlled the
commercialization of the crop. As a result, the organization
of currant commerce and the strategies of the exporters were

the chief factors which shaped the pattern of development of
currant viticulture: in contrast to the situation
characteristic of a developed capitalist economy, in a pre
capitalist social formation dominated by merchant capitalism
it is relations of exchange that fashion relations of
production rather than the opposite. 1
a. The organization of currant trade.
The currant trade was hierarchically organized in several
levels, distinguished by place of action, kind and order of
operation. The highest level within the frontiers of the
kingdom was constituted by the Greek and foreign exporting
houses, with offices in Patras, Aigion and Pirgos. Exporters
collaborated with correspondents abroad or maintained
branches in London and other centres of consumption. 2 They
possessed access to credit both from the national banking
system and from their European partners. 3 According to
contemporary estimates, before the crisis of 1893 the yearly
1See the conc~usion, p.297 below.

3Thus, after several failures which took place in 1864, the Bri:::'.sh Consul a: Patras re'f:lorted ::hac: "as usual, the English merchants and bankers ir. Er.gland have been the chief sufferers" (see BRCREP 1864).

127
borrowing from foreign houses of currant merchants amounted
to 20 - 25 million drachmas; 4 during the same period, the
amount advanced by the National Bank of Greece to currant
merchants and big vineyard owners amounted to a further 15 
20 million drachmas. Yearly fruit exports in 1885-1891 were
valued at 50 to 60 million drachmas. 5
The supply of fruit to the exporting houses was assured
for the most part by smaller merchants established in the
currant producing villages, to whom they anticipated cheap
loans against promises of delivery of determined quantities
of currants immediately after the harvest, at a price to be
fixed according to the quotations of the market at the time
of the fruit's sale. 6 Village merchants in their turn
committed these funds in anticipated purchases from direct
cultivators, at significantly higher interest rates and also
at indeterminate prices. The final settlement of accounts
usually followed the establishment or "cutting" of prices
which traditionally took place in February, after the end of
currant sales in England. 7

128
(1) The universality of the "open prices" system.
Throughout the 19th century "open prices" appear to have
been applied universally throughout the currant sector.
Several contracts found in the archive of
J. Papadiamantopoulos - one of the most important currant
merchants in the last years of Ottoman rule - indicate that
this system had prevailed since at least the early nineteenth
century. 8 The account offered by Hairetis in the late 1870s
shows that two thirds of a century later, the currant
business was carried out in much the same way. The deposit of
currants in the numerous storing-houses established in Patras
started in the very first days of August. Peasants were bound
to deliver their produce to store-keepers who had advanced
them cultivation loans during winter and spring. In this way
from very early in the sales season store-keepers would
accumulate large quantities of fruit, which they marketed on
the owners' account. Either because they were in their turn
indebted to exporters, or in order to secure the sale of some
fruit at the increased prices paid for the first cargoes of
currants arriving in London or Bristol, they-delivered to the
'John Papadiamantopoulos, a national hero of the War of Greek Independence who died during the siege of Messolonghi, used to grant loans to b~g cuc::c::ant. vineyard owners, usually Turkish dignitaries, at 20% to 24% interest, against promises of deli very of currants in August. See Papadiamantopoulos Archive ~s.7872/41-Patras 5/7/1817, Ms.7872/42-Patras 23/12/1818, Ms. 7872/51-?atras 3/12/1820, Ms. 7872/52-Patras 11/5/1820, Ms. 7872/ 58-?atras 29/7 I 1819, Ms. 787 3/128Patras 1/1/1821, Ms.7873/133-Patras 20/1/1821.

129
latter the produce of their debtors without having previously
fixed its price, which was left open to be determined
according to its reception in the foreign markets. Entire
cargoes of currants often left Patras without the owners of
the fruit knowing the price at which the store-keeper had
sold them. 9
The information given by Hairetis is also confirmed by the
correspondence of the branch offices of the National Bank of
Greece established in various currant growing provinces. In
1893, in a letter to the headquarters in Athens, the director
of the Aigion branch of the National Bank of Greece stated
that:
"Currant fruit keeps on being delivered to the merchants'
storing-houses without any price being fixed; it is mainly
the produce of those who were committed to merchants, as
well as that of the merchants' farms and of their
relatives. For any indication on prices we will have to
wait until at least next Monday, when first shipments will
take plaCe. ulO
And a month later he confirmed:
"the part of the crop already loaded was delivered to
exporters at unspecified prices, by their debtors, friends

130
and relatives". 11
Such transactions seriously endangered the interests of
the peasantry and of the lesser landowners who, being in
debt, had nQ say in the fixing of the price by the
store-keepers and exporters. And currant prices were strongly
influenced by the speculative intentions of the merchants and
by "the avidity of the gang of store-keepers", as Hairetis
called them, who cared only about their own interests and
ignored that of their indebted clients.
(2) The form of contracts stipulating anticipated purchases
of currant fruit.
A concrete instance of the mechanisms governing the supply
of credit against promises of currant deliveries at
indeterminate prices is provided by two contracts found in
the notarial archives of Amalias. The first, dating from
1878, recorded that Th. D. Lagkouras, merchant in Patras,
advanced to P. Hr. Koutroulis, merchant in Amalias, the sum
of 5,836.79 drachmas, against the delivery of 100,000
Venetian litres of currant fruit from the crop of August
1879. The liquidation of the loan would be calculated on the
basis of the market prices at the time of the fruit's sale in
11 HANBG, "currant", file 2, Aigion to Athens, 7/9/1893.
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


131
Patras and Lagkouras would take 2% commission. If the
delivered currants fell short of the agreed quantity,
Koutroulis would pay compensation at the rate of 4 drachmas
per 1,000 non-delivered Venetian litres. The loan was granted
"without interest" until August 1879 and 12% interest was to
be paid on any further delay of repayment. According to what
was often stated in similar 19th-century contracts, it may be
assumed that, in practice, interest was included in the
capital sum and that the interest rate was either equal to or
lower than 12%. 12
The second contract, dating from December 1877, recorded
a loan of the same Amalias merchant P. Hr. Koutroulis to the
currant grower D. Katzigianis. The latter, "being in need of
money for the cultivation of his farm and for other
necessities of his household", acknowledged that Koutroulis
lent him the sum of 500 drachmas until August 1878, against
the promise of the debtor to deliver 5,000 litres of currant
fruit to the ware-houses of the merchant before 15/8/1878.
The liquidation of the accounts would be based on prices
running on the market at the moment of the delivery. In case
of delayed repayment of the loan, the interest to be paid
amounted to 24%. On the other hand, Koutroulis declared "to
consider settled" all previous debts and obligations of
12 See cn.4460-25/5/1879.

132
Katzigianis. 13
The second contract is a typical example taken from a
sample of 101 anticipated purchases of currant fruit
consulted in the notarial archives of Amalias. These
documents, dating from the period 1877-1882, concerned
anticipated purchases of currant fruit in exchange for a
loan, usually granted by currant merchants or wealthy farm
owners in November or December, i.e. at the time cultivation
in the vineyards was starting. The price of the fruit was
always left open to be determined at the moment of sale,
according to the prices running on the market. The
compensation to the creditor in case of non-fulfilment of
the promised delivery ranged in the contracts studied between
4 and 50 drachmas per 1,000 non-delivered Venetian litres. If
the loan was not fully reimbursed in August, the interest to
be paid usually amounted to 20% or 24%. The interest of the
loan for its normal duration was usually included in the
capital sum, and therefore its rate was not recorded in the
contract. But in 13 of the contracts studied, where the rate
of interest from the first day of the loan was explicitly
recorded, it was never lower than 20%. It should moreover be
noted that most loans were tacitly renewed for several years,
as indicated by the dates of the contracts concerning their
13 See cn.2743-l7/12/1877.

133
final settlement, usually recorded on the reverse side of the
initial contract. In 35 such cases, the average duration of
loans was 2.7 years (or rather 2.7 currant seasons), ranging
from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 7 years. In other cases,
the loan was renewed through the signature of a new
contract. 14 The rate of interest established for the
eventuality of "delayed" payment therefore functioned in
practice as the normal rate of interest at which the debt was
running.
b. Hierarchical differentiation between sectors of merchant
capital.
As is registered by the documents presented above, the
mechanism of exchange of promised deliveries of fruit at
"open prices" against allocation of credit, reinforced by the
clause of compensation due in case of incomplete delivery,
prevailed at all levels of the currant trade, from agreements
between exporters and intermediaries down to deliveries
promised by direct producers. In practice this meant that the
entire commercial risk fell down to growers, since after
having spent money and effort, they were obliged to place
"The contract between the merchant Koutroulis and the currant grower Katzigianis renewed older obligations of the debtor. See also cn.6376-23/ll/1880, renewing a oan contracted in cn.2586-13/ll/l877 and finally se:tled Or'.:y ir. cn.7278-9/9/l881.

134
their produce in the hands of currant merchants, authorizing
them to settle its price unilaterally.
On the other hand, it looks as if speculation on the
product and its prices was reserved to the higher level of
the currant trade, represented by the commercial houses
established in the exporting cities and ports. As against
this, village merchants, who were also obliged to deliver
fruit to the exporters at indeterminate prices, had few
possibilities of profiting directly from the commerce of
currants itself. In recompense, they realized considerable
gains on the difference between interest rates running on the
loans granted to them by the exporters and those prevailing
on advances to growers: the merchant of Patras charged the
merchant of Amalias 12%, while the latter charged the growers
20%-24%. 15
Village merchants were thus practising a form of usury.
They collected the currant crop from the growers not in order
to profit on its commercialization, but rather in order to
exchange it for handsome and relatively cheap advances from
the exporters. And they insisted in being refunded with
15 It should be noted that rate of interest on loans against p.::or":'ised deliveries of fruit was somewhat lower than that charged on any other kind of loan to peasants. The latter sometimes rose as high as 30% or 40%, even wr,en mortgage on petty farms was presented as collateral. From this one may recognize the discrepancy between currant viticulture and the rest of ag.::icultu.::e. See: cn.2249-9/9/1877, cn.2563 (28%), cn.4557-22/7!1879 (30%), cn.4574-4/8/1879 (38%), cn.4598-12/8!1879 (40%), cn.4638-27/8/1879 (40%), cn.4648-30/8!1879, cn.63ll8/ll/1880, cn.6316-9/ll/1880 (40%), en. 6489-21/12/1880 (30%), en .6503-28/12/1880 (30%), cn.6566-l8/lll88l, cn.6599-27/1/l881 (30%), cn.4462-27/5/l879 (30%).

135
currants - not in cash or with other crops, because only
currants offered them the possibility to borrow cheaply from
exporters in order to lend dearly to peasant growers. 16
The coali~ion between exporters and village merchants,
consisting of the reciprocal recognition of the operative
field of each one, was beneficial to both parties. Village
merchants renounced the profits that would have accrued to
them from commerce in exchange for relatively cheap credit
and an undisturbed monopoly over the supply of the village
capital market; moreover, their profits were guaranteed
against sudden decline of prices, as were those of exporters,
since they too also purchased fruit at indeterminate prices.
In turn, exporters had various reasons for ceding to
village merchants the benefit they might have kept for
themselves had they lent directly to the growers at interest
rates as high as 20% to 24%. First of all, the maintenance of
agencies capable of administering loans and collecting the
crop in a multitude of dispersed villages would have required
a large investment and would probably have proved
unrewarding.
Still more important, in addition to the funds advanced
"The insistence of village merchants on being reimbursed only with currants, expressed by the recompense clause stipulated in the contracts recording the anticipated purchases of the crop, is also witnessed by a wide range of sources (see eg. Kalafatis [1982] p.7). As I personally had the opportunity to observe in March 1987 during a research visit to Stafidokampos, a former currant producing village in the plain of Ilia, creditors' insistence on being reimbursed with currants and not in cash is still alive in the memories of older peasants.

136
by exporters, village merchants undertaking the collection of
fruit committed considerable funds of their own in the
operation. Exporters could thus maximize the stock of
currants they assembled on their account. In order to collect
the quantity of currants promised to the Patras merchant, the
merchant of Amalias was obliged to commit in loans to growers
much more than he received in advance from the former. The
Patras merchant forwarded 5,400 drachmas in cash, against a
'7
promise of delivery of 100,000 Venetian litres of currants;"
however, no less than 85 to 100 drachmas was usually
forwarded to growers for every 1, 000 litres promised. 18
Koutroulis himself advanced to the grower Katzigianis 500
drachmas (nominal) against the promised delivery of 5, 000
Venetian litres . 19 One may reasonably infer that Koutroulis
committed at least another 3,100 drachmas in order to fulfil
his obligations towards his creditor. That is, in order to
collect directly 100,000 litres from growers, the merchant
from Patras would have had to advance a sum almost 60%
greater than the one he actually advanced to the village
17This figure is based on the assumption that the yearly interest rate charged by Lagkouras to Koutroulis amounted to 10% (see above p. ~Jl).
18 This figure s an estimate resu:ting from the analysis o~ 44 co~:yac:s of anticipated currant fruit in Amalias, dating from the same period (1877-1882), on the assumption that the average duration of loans to growers was 9 montns and
that the interest rate was 20%. The average (nominal) sum advanced for each :,o Venetian litres promised was 116 drachmas and only in 9 contracts did it fall below 100 drachmas, the minimum being 58.75.
"see above p.l32.

137
merchant. His additional profits from interest would have
been much greater, since he would have received 20%-24%
instead of 10%-12%, but so probably would have been his
expenses as well. If his main objective is assumed to have
been the collection of the greatest possible quantity of
currants, which would facilitate his effort to influence the
market and to speculate on prices, his decision to entrust
the collection of fruit to the Amalias merchant appears to
have been fairly rational.
The mobilization of the village merchant's resources in
the collection of the currant crop on account of the
exporters was also very valuable to the latter because
village merchants possessed access to institutionalized
credit from the National Bank of Greece. Out of 24 merchants
appearing as currant purchasers in the contracts consulted in
the notarial archives of Amalias, at least 12 were included
in the credit lists of the Pirgos branch office of the
National Bank of Greece. None out of the 71 grower-sellers
were included in the lists. 20 According to the credit list of
1878, the merchant Koutroulis could borrow from the Bank up
to 3,000 drachmas, an amount equal to what he had to commit
in order to supply Lagkouras with the 100,000 litres he had
20 It should be noted that surviving credit lists of the National Bani< of Greece are not complete and that therefore probably at least some of t.he remaining 12 currant purchasers also were customers of the Bani<.

138
promised in that same year. On the other hand, interest rates
charged by the National Bank of Greece on mortgage and other
types of loans to village merchants, varying between 8% and
12%, 21 seem to have determined also the level of rates charged
by exporters. Most probably, the latter could not ignore the
existence of a potentially antagonistic source of credit. 22
Consultation of the archives of the National Bank of
Greece fully confirms that village merchants were committing
to anticipated purchases of fruit from growers not only the
sums forwarded to them for this purpose by exporters, but
also the loans issued by the Bank. A letter dating from 1885
directly denounced the National Bank of Greece for enriching
the local merchants by granting them loans they then re-lent
to currant growers at much higher interest rates. The
210n interest rates of mortgage and other loans issued by the National Bank of Greece, see Dertilis, "Reseaux de credit et strategies du capital" in Dertilis (ed.) [1988] p.72; Thomadakis [1981] p.301 (extract from the regulations of the Bank); Valaoritis [1902] p.21. In some cases of loans mentioned in the Bank's correspondence, I calculated that the interest rate was running at between 8% and 12% (this latter only in cases of overdue loans) .
22 In the early 19th century, prior to the establishment of the Greek state and of the National Bank, J. Papadiamantopoulos used to lend to outstanding Patras merchants at 20 to 24%, After the establishment of the National Bank, such rates were only charged to peasants without access to institutionalized credit: see Papadiamantopoulos Archive Ms.7872/34-l5/ll/1820, ~s.7872/44-8/l0/l819, Ms.7872/46-7/3/1819, Ms. 7872/50-17/1/1820, Ms.7872/51-3/l2/1820, Ms.7872/52ll/5!1820, Ms. 7872/58-29/7/1819. In times of difficulties, and at the risk of endangering his reputation, a merchant could borrow at interest rates as high as 36% (see Ms. 7872/37-9/9/1818). At t.he same time, the upper cle:-gy of the 0:-thodox church received 12% interest on cash they deposited with Papadiamantopculos, who acted as their private banker: see Papadiamantopoulos Archive, Ms. 7872/761/12/1818 and Ms.7872/59-8/3/1820. In the first document Papadiamantopou2.os appears as a guarantor of a loan granted to his brother-in-law Andreas Kalamogdartis by the bishop of Greek Independence Palaion Patron Germanos. On the relationship between Papadiamantopoulos and Kalamogdartis, see Bakounakis :1988; p. 89. It is not accidental that the Church later on became one of the main stockholders of the National Bank.

Director of the Pirgos branch himself reported in September
1884 that "the merchants, after having borrowed [from the
Bank], became moneylenders, advancing capital to the
peasantry in exchange for various benefits". 23
Unlike exporters, the National Bank did not put any
effective limitation on the use of loans issued to village
merchants; these latter could thus freely decide on how to
invest them. The fact that village merchants committed the
funds borrowed from the Bank in anticipated purchases of
currants - as they did with funds advanced by exporters 
indicates that this operation was a very attractive one.
Loans to peasant growers against promises of delivery of
currants were in fact not only a remunerative, but also a
relatively safe investment. According to model estimates, the
difference between the interest rates charged for loans by
currant exporters to village merchants and those charged by
village merchants to growers could only be considered as a
compensation for risk if the risk of default on loans to
peasant growers were more than four times higher than the
risk of default on loans granted to village merchants. 24
Information on 19th century borrowing conditions in
Amalias does not, however, support such an enormous

divergence in risk rates. The merchants' borrowing capacity
was much higher than that of peasant families, since they
could use much more sophisticated means of credit than
peasants - fo! instance, the correspondence of the National
Bank abounds with allusions to bills drawn on it which did
not correspond to any real transaction of goods. 25 As a
result, the debt of a merchant might often exceed the value
of his property. 26 Moreover, in case of bankruptcy, merchants
possessed various ways to avoid judicial seizures and full
reimbursement of their debt, for instance by transferring
property to other members of their family. 27
As against this, peasant families, who enjoyed very
restricted access to credit, could scarcely ever create debts
larger than their wealth and productive capacity. As noted
above, 28 in 1877-1880 the sum advanced against the promise of
delivery of 1, 000 Venetian litres of fruit was 85 to 100
drachmas, though during the same period currants of the local
description were valued in the local market at 140-220
25 See eg. HANBG 7/4/1885 (12), 28/7/1892 (2la).
"Various instances of this are mentioned in the correspondence of the National Bank; see e.g. HANBG 10/10/1884.
"such practices are documented by several fictitious estate property transactions found in the Transactions Register of the Hall of Mortgage Records of Amalias; see eg. the series of transactions of the families i-iarvalos, Galanopoulos, Dalianis. An original alternative is i lustrated by the example of Giannakopouuloi Bros., grocers, who were caught during the night by the agents of the Bank while they transported merchandise out of their shop in order to avoid seizure: see HANBG 24/7/1884 (13).

drachmas. 29 Loans to growers were thus fully secured against
any decline in the value, the quantity or the quality of the
fruit to be delivered, for a proportion of up to 40% to 60%.
Moreover, peasant loans were guaranteed by additional
collateral securities, usually mortgages on small currant
vineyards or cottages, of a market value always considerably
higher than the debt. The courts fully recognized the terms
stipulated by the contracts, interest rates included, and did
not hesitate to authorize seizures of property of indebted
peasants. 3° Consequently, it was rather the borrower who was

faced with risk in case of default rather than the lender. 31
Although not very frequent, seizure of collateral
securities, especially of vineyards and fields bordering on
the creditor's farm, was not totally uncommon. This
incidentally provides an additional explanation for the
monopoly of local merchants over the supply of the village
31As aptly put by A. Bhaduri, referring to the context of Indian peasant agriculture:
"In such fragmented credit markets where the lender has considerable monopoly power in undervaluing the price of collateral securities, the concept of a lender's risk premium becomes not only irrelevant but positively misleading. By undervaluing the collateral securities sufficiently, the lender can not only cover his capital loss of defaulted loan, but also make a "capital gain" through transfer of the collateral in case of default. Such a situation is characterized not by lender's risk but by borrower's risk in case of default." Bhaduri [1983] p.77.
However, I would not subscribe to Bhaduri's position that under these conditions money-lenders systematically aimed at seizures in order to realize a "capital gain", at least in the case of 19th-century Peloponnese. Bhaduri uses the concept of borrower's risk in the framework of a model quite different from the one presented here. His view is that moneylenders positively try to provoke default in order to profit from the capital gain arising from seizure of the undervalued collateral. The debtor in turn is supposed to consider credit from unorganized credit markets as an "inferior good" and is expected to borrow less when his revenue increases. Consequently "a landlord's income from usury may decrease as a result of increased level of income for his tenant" (ibidem, p.83). His line of reasoning leads to the well-known and justly criticized thesis - see Ghose and Saith [1976], Griffin [1974], Newbery [1975), Srinivasan [1979], Bardhan [1984] and others of "maintenance of forced commerce through technological backwardness", by which landlords and moneylenders positively hinder economic growth in order to prevent the peasants' revenue from increasing, an effect which would supposedly decrease their profits from forced commerce. The problem is that if moneylenders possess the monopoly power to undervalue collateral securities and to impose high interest rates, then it is difficult to understand why they should not also have the power to extract sufficient part or even the whole of the increase of the debtor's revenue in case of technological improvement. If on the other hand the creditor, drawing his profits principally from moneylending, does not aim at radically changing the system of cultivation, why should he systematically proceed to seizures, thus endangering the profitable personalized relationship he maintains with his debtors? In the case of 19th century Peloponnese, my impression is that village merchants lent to peasants principa~ly in order to profit from high interest rates and not in order to seize securities; they did not of course disdain seizing mortgaged fields bordering on their farms or if some change in the conditions of the debtor's family rendered t!"',e relationship less profitable or more risky. As Eve Karousou observed during her current research on an impressive set of 19th century loan contracts fro~ the district of Argos, creditors often proceeded to seizures when the head cf the indebted family died and when no guarantees existed that heirs (eg. a widow with young children) were able to respect the family's obligations.

credit market: undervalued collateral securities offered by
peasant growers, other than promises of delivery of currant
fruit, could not be of any particular use to exporters and
bigger merchants established far away from the mortgaged
securities. A petty vineyard or a small house could not serve
much to a big exporting company, though it could be very
valuable to the owner of the neighbouring big farm who wished
to enlarge his estate. 32
c. The speculative practices of currant exporters and their
impact on the terms of trade.
By applying "open prices", exporters and village merchants
avoided having to discount risks from commercialization,
which fell entirely on the growers; they thus increased the
amount of currants they could market with a given amount of
32The observations of A. Bhaduri op.cit., p. 76, although they refer to a different context, characterized by a much less advanced degree of commercialization than the currant growing Peloponnese, are particularly relevant to this point: "The functioning of unorganized rural money markets is inextricably interwoven with economic power relations between the debtor and the creditor, which serve a dual purpose in determining the acceptability of collateral securities and valuing them for advancing loans. Because the lender frequently enjoys considerable personal power over the borrower, he can enforce the terms and conditions of the loan arrangement far more effectively than an institutional lender from the organized money market. A landlord lending to his tenants, or a local money-lending trader through whom the borrowing peasant markets his harvest, is usually in a much stronger position than a lender in an organized market to recover defaulted loans, using such means as attachment of future labour services, direct or indirect transfer of land through revision of tenurial arrangements etc. This personal power over the borrower allows a private moneylender to accept otherwise unacceptable securities for advancing loans, and the general unmarketability of these collaterals by the peasant in the organized credit market for assets also gives a private moneylender the exceptional economic power to place an arbitrary valuation on the collaterals offered by poor peasants. "

capital, because they were not obliged to hold reserves for
the eventuality of a season of bad prices.
On the other hand, by avoiding the discount of risks from
commerce, exporters renounced the lawful recompense which
would have accrued to them had they guaranteed to the growers
a fixed price for their produce. As a result, their profits
came to depend mainly on speculative manipulations or
straightforward fraud. If exporters and village merchants had
not tried to influence prices according to their own interest
and had cleared their accounts with the growers according to
the prices really paid by the foreign markets, the difference
between producer's and export prices, constituting the
merchants' profit, would not have exceeded by much taxes and
cost of transport. In fact, given that risk was assumed by
the grower, in a perfect market, recompense for it should be
calculated together with the cost of production, and
producer's prices should not normally differ much from export
prices.
Savage speculation was thus an integrate part of the
merchants' practices, the necessary complement of the system
of "open prices". Protected as they were by it, exporters, in
the pursuit of market control and profit maximization, could
freely play around with the value of currants, the quality
and timing of deliveries.

For instance, they often used to accept orders for large
deliveries of fruit from the future crop. 33 Having concluded
agreements with a firm abroad, they often speculated on the
devaluation of the crop, trying to profit from the difference
between the price fixed with foreign importers and the price
paid to local intermediaries, determined only at the moment
of delivery of fruit according to the quotations of the
market. A frequently adopted practice aiming at a fall in
prices was to spread rumours that the harvest exceeded the
needs of international demand. 34
Another practice which also destabilized trade and
stimulated the decline in price was competition between
merchants to export as quickly as possible the maximum
33 See e.g. BRCREP 1881: "Large contracts for deli very of currants in November, December, January, and February were made by Greeks and other foreigners with French buyers in the early part of the season, and this having become generally known, speculators were forced, in order to fulfil their engagements, to pay higher prices than would otherwise have been necessary." That occasion of course represented the exception rather than the rule, since it occurred under the sudden and heavy pressure of the entrance of France into the currant market. For information on a much earlier period, see the interesting correspondence on orders by Davison Newman & Co. of London to merchants in Leghorn for the purchase of currant fruit from the Morea and the Ionian Islands during the period 1778 - 1817 (Ms.8612/l of the manuscript.section of Guildhall Library, London).
34 0n this point see also Kalafatis [1987] p.210. By contras::, fT'.erchan::s of the foreign markets, having concluded agreements at fixed prices, did their best to provoke increases. Spreading false rumours seems to have been a very common practice, as also indicated by the following short ironic comment of The Fruit Trade Journal of London, No 11, July 31, 1890, p.345,
"Up went the price of - currants!" Mr. Golds, "the Currant King", is back again. Now listen to the result; the market which had been declining during his absence steadied immediately."
Mr. E.A.Golds was a member of the permanent committee of ::he wholesale dealers in dried fruits (ibidem, April 1, 1890, No 4, p.110).

available quantities of fruit. 35 In that way foreign markets
were glutted and transactions could proceed only by lowering
prices. 36 Most probably, the exporters' haste, at least in
part, was deliberately aimed at devaluation. It also pointed
to the high prices traditionally attributed to first arrivals
of fruit. Exporters tried to place on the market first the
product of their own vineyards and that of their close
associates. Moreover, early realization permitted merchants
who operated with limited and often with borrowed funds to
clear their accounts as quickly as possible, thus saving
interests and speeding up the turnover of their running
capital. 37
15 See HAIRETIS [1883] pp.461-463 and 467-473; also BRCREP l895: "At the opening of the currant season, 28/8 by law, 3 steamers from London and 2 from Liverpool, guaranteed by their owners to do the passage home with early fruit within ten days, obtained full cargoes at the handsome freights of 1 lOs per ton. Shipowners having steamers of capacity of not over 1000 tons, capable of doing the run from Patras to London and Liverpool within ten days, ;;ho may 1-1ish to compete for this early business, should put themselves into communication with some of the ship agents in this place during the month of May or June."; BRCREP 1896: "At the opening of the currant season in August, when a large fleet of steamers usually collects to carry home early cargoes of fruit at enhanced rates of freight, there was considerable disappointment for shipowners, as the crop was unusually late, much smaller supplies than usual were sent forward from the provinces for sale, and many steamers, having been lying for a long time on the berth waiting for cargo, had to leave almost empty, in order to fulfil their engagements elsewhere,"
''According to Hairetis [1883] p.467-471, the effects of competition between merchants to export as quickly as possible worsened wi::h the s'Jbstitution of steamers for sailing vessels in the 1860s. Because of their limi::ed capac~::y and their dependence on the weather, sailing vessels carried the crop in sr:1a:_ler quantities and used to reach London at rather unpredictable dates, thus helping the prices to stay high for longer periods. As against this, big s::earr.e::s transported most of the crop in a very short time, increased supply anc established equilibrium between supply and demand at a lower price.

(1) Short-term movement of prices in Patras.
The short-term movement of prices in the main export
centre, that of Patras, represented on graph III.1, reflects
quite clearly the cumulative impact of the merchants'
speculative practices. Except for 1879 and 1880, years marked
by the sudden and massive opening of the French market to
Greek currants, 38 prices always showed a considerable decline
between the start of the transactions on a year's crop in
August-September and the end of the year. 39 This four-month
period included the great bulk of shipments of a year's crop.
The decline of prices varied much between different
qualities; the graph presents the evolution of the average as
well as the maximum rate of decline registered for any single
quality (usually referring to the lowest quality which also
represented most of the crop) .
As suggested above, declining prices directly favoured the
merchants' interests. Since growers could not easily check
the exact date their produce was exported, merchants could
tell them that it was exported after the prices had dropped.
In that way, that part of the crop merchants managed to
export at the beginning of the sales' season at high prices,

they could reimburse to growers at the low prices of the end
of the year.
An episode illustrating such a manoeuvre is reported in
1888 by the director of the branch office of the National
Bank at Pirgos. In that year, producers deposited their fruit
in the merchants' ware-houses right after the harvest,
earlier and in a more massive way than usual. Having the
option to "declare" the sale of their product at any moment

149
they wished, i.e. to ask to be paid for it at the prices
running at that particular moment on the market, several
producers chose September, some others November or December,
and a few left the date open for further confirmation, in
order to choose the date they would consider most convenient.
The merchants, as soon as they got possession of several
millions of Venetian litres of currants by committing
insignificant amounts of capital, hastily exported important
quantities at rewarding prices, with which'they satisfied the
requirements of foreign consumption. After completion of that
operation they deliberately devalued the crop by starting to
send to the foreign markets currants damaged by rain or mixed
with dirt, selling them at very low prices. This change
occurred at the very moment producers were due to be paid.
Those who had already chosen a fixed date or were not able to
wait any more because of urgent needs, were paid at only 135
140 drachmas per Venetian litre, i.e. at 30% less than the
opening price of the respective quality of fruit in 1888. 4c
And those who could wait longer just postponed their
"declaration", hoping for better days to come. 41

considerably over one and the same season shows the degree to
which Greek merchants avoided committing funds in storing the
crop and in waiting for satisfactory prices of realization.
It is not po_ssible to check whether any single ;roup of
merchants wished to follow any alternative policy; but there
is no doubt that since the interests of all merchants were
protected against devaluation of the crop by the application
of "open prices", none of them was urged to change things. 42
(2) A comparison between Patras and London prices.
In order to assess the far-reaching negative consequences
of the system of "open prices", let us examine what would
have been the probable implications of an economically
sounder behaviour. If currant exporters had been willing to
assume and discount the risks arising from currant trade,
they would have effected their anticipated purchases from
producers at determined prices. These prices would have been
lower than those actually paid by the merchants, since risk
would have been discounted. Exporters would have committed
"Hairetis [ 1883] p. 4 72 suggests that even though some merchanc:s possessing their own capital might have wished to follow a more reasonable policy, they were obliged to follow the example of hurried se lers who formed the majority. But one may doubt the true intentions of the bigger merchants: these latter controlled a considerable part of currant exports and might seriously influence the dominant practices of the market. For example, Kalafatis [1987] p.l87-l88, tabl_e 52 reports that in 1879 the two oiggest exporting houses, the German Fells & Co. and that of Geroussis (a close relative of Hairetis) exported 50% of the entire quantity of currants sent to France in that particular year.
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


151
more capital in order to discount risks, but they would have
been recompensed for it by the increased difference between
producer's and export prices. Meanwhile, instead of trying to
devalue the crop, merchants would have tried to sell it at
the best possible prices, since they would have direct
interests in it.
The comparison between the movement of prices at Patras
and at London, presented on graph III.2, indicates that, in
fact, the crop might have been sold at better prices. In both
places, prices usually moved in the same direction,
reflecting the changing relation between volume of the crop
and quantity needed by international consumption. However,
wholesale London prices tended to amplify price increases at
Patras and to show a certain inertia in their adjustment to
price drops in the places of production. Only in two out of
ten years of observation for first quality fruit (in 1876 and
1877) and in four out of ten for lower quality fruit (1868,
1875, 1877 and 1878} did London prices rise less than Patras
prices; in the remaining eight and six years respectively,
either they rose more sharply or they showed a smoother
decline.

Another comparison between currant prices at Patras and
London for the period 1875-1896, although much less accurate
because referring to a series of London prices which did not
differentiate between different qualities, shows that in only
seven out of twenty years of observation did the difference

Prices at London do not include import duty.

between Patras and London prices display any tendency to
decrease. 44
A test carried out for the period 1882-1896 demonstrated
that fluctuation of freights did not provide even a partial
explanation for the observed divergence between prices in
London and at Patras (apart from the fact that freightage
represented less than 5-6% of the value of currants) . 45 The
above comparison therefore indicates that sellers at London
tended to be more firm and obtained relatively better prices
than did holders of fruit in Patras. 46
That London merchants often managed to increase the
difference between Patras and London currant prices confirms
that currant prices at Patras were by no means the highest
that international consumption would have accepted. Had Greek
exporters been willing to improve their marketing practices
by committing larger amounts of capital for longer periods,
"This comparison was made utilising the average prices at Patras reported by the British Consul and the average prices at London reported by Pi zanias [1988], table VI of the appendix, pp. 141-142. The latter series is the mean of a random compilation of different prices of different qualities (cfr. ibidem pp.86-87) and is therefore not to be used without reservation.
"Freights for the shipment of currants from Patras to London are regular~y reported by the British consul at Patras in his annual account.
4'A concrere example is offered by a report on the Londo~ curran: ~a~ke: ·n The Fruit Trade Journal, n.l6, 4/911890: "About 1600 tons were placed on the market by the arrival of the first two vessels. A fair business has been done in all growths, though sales have been rather slow owing to the merchants forgetting the reduct~cn that has taken place in the duty" (emphasis added). !n 1890, the British import duty on currants was reduced from 7 to 2 sn!_1ings per cwt.; presumably, importers tried to profit on the reduct~on by se:ling at tne same prices as before.

154
the value of the currant crop would have greatly improved, to
the benefit of the sector and of the Greek economy at large.
d. The attitude of growers.
Currant growers did not always suffer without protest the
effects of the merchants' speculative practices. The British
consul at Cephalonia reported in 1866 that:
"Sales opened at 32 dollars per mil in the Lixuri market,
on which side the finest currants are produced, not
without undue pressure, however, for the peasantry who
farm the vineyards, and have an immediate interest in half
the produce, assembled en masse, assumed a menacing
attitude, and intimated a determination to prevent
purchases at a lower price being embarked ... " 47
But the peasantry had few chances of improving the marketing
conditions of their produce, since merchants possessed much
stronger means for overcoming any resistance. The same consul
reported in the next year's account that:
"as regards the merchants, the first effect of their
recent experience will naturally be to induce greater
caution, and an abstinence from all speculation, not

change in the methods adopted for ensuring a ready supply
of stock for the opening market, a change which could not
fail to produce increased distress among the growers,
accustomed hitherto to rely on large advances in cash on
the strength of the coming crop. " 48
The change alluded to by the consul was that Cephalonian
merchants, in order to become independent of the local
supply, started buying up increasing quanti ties of Morea
fruit for delivery in Cephalonia, where it was deposited, on
arrival, in the Transit Stores, and thence reshipped for
England "at the convenience of the purchasers". 49
Another popular outburst against the practices of the
merchants occurred in the early 1860s, when manifestations in
Aigion and other currant growing centres convinced the
government to pass a law making obligatory the fixing of
prices prior to any delivery of fruit. But the law was soon
revoked, without leaving any trace upon the established
practices of the currant trade. 50
The indeterminacy of price until after the delivery of
fruit reflected the unconditional ·ascendancy of merchant
capital over currant production, which could by no means be

altered by the simple promulgation of a law. The practice of
"open prices" constituted the organizing principle of currant
commerce, similar to the "contratto all a voce" which
prevailed in Southern Italy for olive oil and wheat. 51 As
noted above, its main effect was that the entire trading risk
weighed on the grower, without his being in a position to
influence the fate of his crop. Because he was obliged to
deliver the crop to his creditors without even knowing
51 0n the chronologically earlier Southern Italian counterpac: to the Peloponnesian anticipated purchases of currant fruit, see Aymard [1978] p.ll~7: " ... Vie infine il livello dei rapporti sociali di produzione, dove la funzione del denaro e lungi dal limitarsi a quella di un semplice strumento per il pagamento dei salari e dei canoni. Piu diffusa e piu insidiosa, la sua presenza vi assume forme piu complesse e piu vincolanti. Le vendite anticipate, "alla meta" o "alla voce", sottendono il funzionamento dell'agricoltura meridionale: sono la contropartita degli anticipi in denaro, in grano per la semina o l'alimentazione, in bestiame, talvolta in arature del maggese compiute con le bestie da tiro del gabelloto, e il prezzo da rimborsare e un prezzo "politico", fissato all'indomani del raccolto dalle amministrazioni locali, che deve remunerare ]'interesse "legitimo" dei capitali anticipati dai mercanti; in caso di non regolamento del credito accordato, in denaro o in natura, questa puo venire regolato nella stagione successiva; rna i tomoli di grano e le libbre di seta non consegnati saranno allora fatturati al prezzo del mercato, sensibilmente superiore.

Ma anche allora continuano a integrare i produttori contadini entro un sistema vincolante, che li esclude di fat to dall 'accesso diretto al mercato, e quindi dai possibili guadagni della commercializzazione."
But even in more recent times and even in relatively ''modern" sectors such as that of citrus fruit, credit continued to play an imporLant role as a means of control over Southern-Italian agricultural product on and commercialization of agricultural produce. See Aymard [1987] p.20: "Salvatore Lupo, nel ripercorrere un secolo di scoria della coltura degli agrumi in Sicilia, ha in effetti sottolineato con chiarezza tutte le ambiguita di questa "agricoltura ricca", conquistatrice sicura di s!, che segna progressi rapidissimi a partire dagli anni '50 e '60 dell'Ottocento.

157
whether the costs of production would be reimbursed, the
grower was deprived of any bargaining power and was left at
the mercy of exporters, store-keepers and village merchants.
The timing of these popular outbursts is, however, quite
significant. The 1860s were the only decade of successive
years of low currant prices throughout the long golden era of
the currant trade, covering most of the 19th century. Between
1867 and the end of the century, when overproduction led once
again to continuous and serious decline of currant prices, no
peasant unrest is recorded whatsoever and long social peace
seems to have ruled.
Thus, merchants' speculations seem to have encountered
peasant resistance only in bad times. But under favourable
circumstances, when profits from currant trade were so great
that, even though merchants kept most of them, the part left
to the grower was substantial, the peasantry accepted the
rules of the game set by the merchants.
It may in fact be argued that, by using savage speculative
practices such as those described above, exporters could not
always sweep from growers the entire benefit from the
commercialization of the crop. The following example,
referred to by Ch. Agriantoni, 52 indicates that although
merchants enjoyed considerable liberty in settling currant
"Agriantoni [1986] p.70, reported by the French consul in Patras.

158
prices according to their interests, they were nevertheless
not completely uncontrolled. In 1859, after the bankruptcy of
one of the two biggest foreign currant exporting houses
(Igget & Co.) , the remaining one (Burff & Co.) considered
that there were no more competitors and offered abusively low
prices to the farmers - 125 to 160 francs for a thousand
litres of good quality fruit. But Greek merchants immediately
intervened and started to buy at prices ranging between 265
and 325 francs; Burff & Co. was finally constrained to
surrender.
Moreover, when, thanks to strong international demand and
despite the speculations of the Greek merchants, prices
tended to increase vigorously, growers could make good
profits. For instance, as reported by the British consul at
Patras for the year 1872:
"Although growers and shippers anticipated low prices,
basing their calculations on the prices of previous years,
when the crops were very much less in quantity than now,
they have been agreeably disappointed, and have obtained
higher rates than they did when the crop~ were small ...
It is evident that so large a crop ... at the average high
price of 21 per ton, has thrown a large amount of money
into the hands of the agricultural and labouring classes;

159
and there has, consequently, been a large increase in the
amount of goods imported. " 53
Similarly, in 1880, when the opening of the French market
caused a rise in currant prices between the start of
shipments in September and the end of the year, 54 the British
consul reported:
"The shipments to France have relieved the English market
of a large surplus quantity, so that prices have been well
maintained in all places of consumption to the great
benefit of the Greek grower. " 55
e. A risk-neutral peasantry?
Although the sector was dominated by the speculative
practices of merchants illustrated in the previous
paragraphs, peasant families continued for more than a
century to massively settle in the coastal plains of the
Peloponnese in order to cultivate currants. This indicates
that, despite what is usually considered to be the typical

160
attitude of the peasantry towards risk, 56 peasant growers seem
in the case of currant viticulture to have borne the risks
from trade almost without complaint.
It may be argued that in all probability, due to labour
scarcity, elevated productivity and high remuneration of work
in the vineyards, currant growers were not dangerously close
to subsistence levels of consumption and that they could
afford a bad currant season without risking to starve.
Moreover, it is probable that creditors did not go very far
in seizing the mortgaged properties of indebted peasants, and
that in cases of bad trade conjunctures, they would rather
renew the loans of their debtors, waiting for better times.
f. The interaction between the organization of trade and the
organization of production.
As suggested above, the fact that currant merchants
avoided assuming and discounting trading risks led them to
speculative marketing practices which worsened the terms of
trade. They thus contributed to the creation of an unstable
economic environment, characterized by violent shifts from
prosperity to disaster and from high to low prices and vice
"Students of peasant economics widely accept that peasants, living close to mir.imum levels of subsistence, tend to be much more risk-averse than rich landowners or merchants (see e.g. Adams and Rask [1968], R. Pearce [1983] p.58).

161
versa.
Trade instability, in turn, influenced significantly the
organization of currant production. Although as suggested in
the previous chapter, wealthy and powerful local families
managed to establish large and consolidated vineyards, the
uncertainty of the currant market rendered very difficult the
direct exploitation of these farms. A wealthy farm owner
willing to run his estate with the aid of hired labour would
need - in addition to the ordinary circulating capital for
advancing wages and other expenses of the yearly cultivation
- a considerable reserve of funds in order to survive bad
selling years and to be able to expect for the good ones. But
a possessor of capital would prefer committing it to trade or
money-lending, activities which yielded elevated and
relatively safe returns, rather than immobilizing it in
farming.
On the contrary, the peasant family unit of production
possessed labour of its own, abundant and reliable; peasant
family heads were not obliged to advance wages and - if
necessary - they could convince the members of their family
to reduce their consumption. This offered them a flexibility
which was invaluable in bad conjunctures.
As a result, the production unit which prevailed in the
currant sector was the peasant family farm; and the only

162
viable solution for the large farms of non-peasant owners was
to rent them to peasant share-croppers. On the other hand,
the predominance of small units of production accentuated the
under-capitalization of agriculture - itself a preliminary
condition for the domination of merchant capital. 57 As will
be argued in greater detail in the following chapters,
merchant domination and peasant organization of production
reinforced each other, blocked the possibility of a radical
qualitative shift of the economy and were perpetuated and
reproduced throughout the secular
expansion of the currant sector.
"For a general theoretical discussion of the incompatibility of merchant capital ascendancy with a high degree of economic development, see K.Marx,Caoital, vol.3, pp.323-338.

Chapter IV. Notables, peasants and currant vineyards.
The negative influence of the predominance of merchants
on the currant sector was not restricted to the instability
provoked by their way of carrying out trade; the very fact
that currant exporters were, together with the National Bank
of Greece, the exclusive suppliers of credit to agriculture,
posed quite complicated problems for the organization of
production.
Capital requirements for the creation of vineyards had a
primarily long-term character, since several years would
elapse until amortization of the expenses of planting and
infrastructure. But merchants aimed at a rapid turnover of
their assets; the National Bank had been set up to serve
commerce and the public treasury, not agriculture or
industry. As a result, long-term loans were simply not
available on the money market. 1
The solution offered by Peloponnesian society to the
contradiction between long-term exigencies and the
exclusively short-term character of credit supply consisted
of an arrangement between notable purchasers of National
Estates and peasant families which stipulated the active
participation of both sides in costs, risks and benefits

arising from the creation of currant vineyards. In
particular, this arrangement offered peasant families the
possibility of acquiring currant vineyard property in
exchange for planting the elite's farms.
a. The typical currant vineyard farm.
M. Hairetis and the folklorist D. Psihogios provide
detailed accounts of the permanent land improvements required
to create currant farms, and these are amply confirmed by
archival sources. 2 As reported, the land was first carefully
drained and cleaned of stones and bushes. The fields situated
on the hill-sides were divided in several parts by stone
terraces, perpendicular to the slope of the soil, which
prevented the earth from being washed away by rain and
continuous digging. After the walls had been built, the
ground was levelled by hoe and holes were dug to receive tne
new vines. An ample corridor of about two meters was left
between every other row of currant vines, wide enough for a
cart. Finally, a trench was dug around the field to drain off
the water coming from the rows of the vines and discharge it
in the nearest ditch or gorge. After the trenches had been
dug, the field was fenced with reeds, except for the sides

bordering on other currant farms, which were left unfenced.
Somewhere on the estate, often on its higher and better
ventilated part, a house called metohi was constructed for
the sojourn of the owner's family during the summer months.
The metohi was equipped with facilities depending on the
owner's affluence: it might vary from a simple hut to a
luxurious neoclassical villa, similar to those possessed by
wealthy farm owners and merchants in town. 3 In big estates,
not very far from the luxurious "metohi" where landowners
spent a part of the summer, there were also simpler houses to
which the share-croppers (semproi) and their families moved
during the critical months of currant cultivation, namely
June, July and August. 4
The metohi was usually surrounded by orchards with citrus
and other fruit trees, vegetables and flowers. Indispensable
elements of the estate were also threshing floors for the
drying of currants, one or more wells, cisterns, store
houses, paths linking the farm and the house to the main
road, useful for the transportation of fruit by cart, as well
as for the passage of the landowner's coach. The main
'According to E. Psihogiou [1987], p.228, in the plain of Ilia, "there often existed luxurious dwellings in the big estates of currant merchants and other rich families, similar to the magnificent neoclassical houses these people owned in town".
'Share-cropping agreements sometimes expressly specified the obligation of share-croppers to stay with their family in the metohi: see cn.2725-l2/~2/l877, cn.4528-3/7/79.

entrance was usually closed with an iron or wooden door and
stone-built columns. In addition to currant vines, covering
the major part of the estate, there were also olive trees,
wine vines, and arable land reserved for sowing winter
cereals. 5
b. Short term inelasticity of currant production to price.
Apart from the considerable expenses required for the long
term improvements described above, currant viticulture was
also in great need of long-term credit because of the
frequent cyclical crises of the sector, which could not be
met by a reduction in the costs of cultivation.
The decision to plant was binding, because it implied 
besides costs of initial investment the permanent
'An impressive descri.ption of a currant farm is found in HANBG Pirgos, 30/4/1882, n.7a, provided by the judicial announcement of auction of the property of P. I. Halikiopoulos, the most important National Bank debtor at ?irgos, politician and editor of the "Journal of Greek Agriculture". This farm was probably one of the biggest and best equipped of its time, covering 501.803 stremmata (50.18 ha) of land in the vicinity of Pirgos, cut into three parts by two roads passing through the fields. The first of the three parts was 93.7 stremmata large, situated on the slope of a hill; on its top, 3 stremmata formed a plateau, where a two-floor stone-built house was constructed, 730 square meters large. It had 11 rooms, 45 doors and windows, and was "nicely embellished" with a staircase of marble. It also possessed 4 storehouses, 1, 650 square meters large, and a well. The fields around the house were planted with 80 stremmata of currant. vines, 890 olive-trees, 300 pear-trees, 100 fig-trees, 80 almond-trees and 40 mulberry-trees. The second part, 192 stremmata large, was f~at, planted with 160 stremmata of currant vines, tidily cultivated, an orchard of 15 stremmata with citrus and other fruit trees, 2 stremmata of wine vine-trees, 3 st.remmata sultana vine, a cistern, solidly constructed, a warehouse 245 square meters large, built with limestone and surrounded by a peristyle, and two we~ls equipped with British pumps. In the third part, 215.4 stremmata large, there were 63 stremmata with sultana and mulberry nurseries and a stone-built cistern. The rest was arable land. The estate bordered onto currant vineyards of other owners and national lands.

obl j_ gat ion to provide for the maintenance of the vines. Once
planted, the currant vine needed continuous care and
expenditure, otherwise it would turn wild and part of the
initial investment would be completely lost. Repairing the
damage caused by a single season's careless cultivation might
require several years of special treatment. 6 Even when prices
barely covered costs, growers carried on farming by any
possible means and sacrifice in order to preserve the
productive capacity and value of their vineyards. 7 This goal
could not of course always be attained and lack of resources
often led to defective cultivation; 8 but this kind of
compulsory adaptation to short term expectations was not an
efficient solution, since it provoked great damage to the
vines.

7The concern of producers to find the means for sustaining cultivation in years of disastrously low prices is indeed very frequently expressed in the sources. Such examples were often referred in the accounts of the director of the Pirgos Department of the National Bank of Greece, who reported that ~andowners were in such cases obliged to contract usurious loans (e.g. HANBG Pirgos, 25/4/1869, l/12/1870, 16/:l/1879).

168
of cultivation to conjunctural conditions conferred on the
currant sector a marked inflexibility, with serious effects
on its development. Greece held the international monopoly of
currant prod~ction; consequently, the market was directly
influenced by the volume of the Greek crop, and prices
depended on its relation to international demand. Excessive
supply induced disproportionate falls in prices, and the
total value of abundant crops was often lower than that of
smaller ones. But since currant growers could not adjust
output to expectations, the fall in prices did not have any
immediate impact on supply. In fact, during the entire period
1830-1893, the volume of the crop only fell when it was
affected by unfavourable weather or disease. There was never
any deliberate decrease of production and cultivation
increased continuously, except when financial conditions were
so adverse that farmers could not find even the means
indispensable for preventing deterioration of their
vineyards.
As a result, the main factor determining the evolution of
the volume of the crop was the past rate of creation of
vineyards. But this rate was not related to current prices.
Thus, at times of depression, the crop usually continued to
increase, due to formerly planted vineyards gradually
continuing to reach maturity., In such cases, the increase of

169
production accentuated the problem of excessive supply, and
at the same time led to an increase in overall production
costs.
c. The impact of price fluctuations on the expansion of
vineyards.
As against lack of short term output elasticity, fruit
prices had a decisive long term impact on production through
the variation of the rate of expansion of vineyards.
According to contemporary observers, most vineyards were
planted in years of favourable prices, and conversely, low
prices slowed down any planting activity. Massive planting in
1834-1841, 1845-1847 and 1856-1857 was attributed to the high
prices ruling during those years. 9
Detailed analysis of the correlation of the rate of
expansion of vineyard acreage to price variations and to
other factors influencing investment in the currant sector
would require the accurate assessment of the evolution of the
planted area. But the only index available for indirectly
estimating vineyard acreage is the rate of growth of
production, and this index presents several defects. 10 The
'See Mansolas [1868] p.72 and p.74 and Efimeris Ellinikis Georaias, ~anuary 1856, p.205.

170
volume of a year's crop was related to vineyards aged at
least seven years, since vines only yielded fruit seven years
after being planted. But a year's crop was also influenced by
climatic conditions, as well as by the meticulousness of
cultivation in that and in the directly preceding years, and
this in its turn depended on the availability of resources.
As a result, only crops of years characterized by favourable
weather, by absence of disease and by careful cultivation can
indicate with satisfying precision the evolution of vineyard
acreage.
In the second half of the 19th century, crops meeting
these requirements were only those of the years 1871, 1876,
1878, 1881, and partly those of 1888 and 1893. 11 On the basis
of the volume of production in the respective years, and by
allowing seven years as a period necessary for the
development of the vines, it may be inferred that the average
yearly growth of vineyard acreage was 2.4% from·1865 to 1869,
7.8% in 1870 and 1871, 9.3% from 1872 to 1874, 3.6% from 1875
to 1881 and 3.2% from 1882 to 1886.
These figures seem generally to confirm the suggested
association between prices and rate of creation of new
vineyards. The relatively slow rate in 1865-1869 was due to
the low prices which ruled from 1864 to 1868 and increase of

171
prices from 1869 led to the unprecedented rates of creation
of vineyards in 1870-1874. Most probably, the distribution of
National Estates in 1871 played a major role in accelerating
the growth of.vineyard acreage since 1872. High rates were
probably the rule also in 1875-1886, following the high
prices prevalent during the latter period; 12 but the
diminishing productivity of the vineyards which started to
grow old in the late 1880s partly counteracted their impact
on the size of the crop. 13
The observed correlation between high currant prices and
increased rate of investment in currant vineyards was by no
means a matter of expectations: when deciding to plant a
vineyard, the farmer could not foresee the prices its produce
would obtain seven years later. It was very probable that
vines planted in years of high prices would give fruit in
years of low prices, since the value of the crop often
dropped considerably from one year to the next. Hence, it

"; BRCREP 1881: "Large plantations of currants continue to be made ... "; BRCREP 1882: "New plantations are constantly being made, as a large quantity of suitable land is yearly being brought under cultivation."; BRCRE? 1887: " ... many young plantations are being made in all the currantproducing districts"; BRCREP 1890: " ... many new plantations of currants are made yearly".
13 See eg. BRCREP 1887: "Many agriculturalists are of the opinion tha: the very old plants are getting exhausted, partly also on account of the ring-cutting now universally carried out on the stock of the vine." Also, BRCRt:? ~89:J: "Apparently many old currant vineyards are not so productive as former iy, ana require to be renewed."

172
would be ingenuous to assume that people deciding to commit
resources to the creation of vineyards in years of favourable
market conditions did so because they hoped that such
conditions would last forever.
A much more plausible explanation is that high prices
stimulated planting by generating additional income available
for investment in currant vineyards. In years of favourable
market conditions, farm owners committed to the expansion of
their farms a great part of the increased profits from the
sale of their produce, without pretending to foresee in how
many years their expenses would be reimbursed.
As natural, the unpredictability of the period of
amortization of the initial investment further aggravated the
long-term character of the credit requirements for the
creation of vineyards. Moreover, in case of trade depression,
additional capital was needed in order to face costs
(interests, instalments of National Estates etc.) until the
recovery of fruit and vineyard prices.

sufficient to finance the rapid expansion of vineyards. And
as argued above, cultivation loans granted by the National
Bank or loans advanced by the exporters against the delivery
of fruit from the future crop were not adapted to the
financial needs of vineyard creation.
Such loans usually lasted nine months, from November to
August, and were meant to serve exclusively as rotating capi
tal for the financing of the year's cultivation. Exporters,
as well as the Bank, insisted on full reimbursement
immediately after the harvest, if possible in early August.
When the raisins were dried and ready for export, merchants
were urged to ship as quickly and as great a quantity as
possible. At the same time, the Bank needed cash in order to
buy exchange bills drawn on foreign houses by currant
exporters, which were essential for the service of its
international commitments and the finance of import trade. 14
But farmers could not easily refund their creditors in
August, if they employed the funds borrowed in winter to
plant new vines that would become profitable only seven years
later. Those wishing to invest in the creation of currant

farms were thus obliged to convert part of the short-term
credit received from the Bank and the exporting houses into
long-term credit corresponding to the real needs of the
currant economy.
This conversion could take place in various ways.
Cultivation loans could cater for the needs of the vineyards
as circulating capital, in so far as the rich farmers'
capital could be safely deployed towards long-term
commitments. Farm owners could also spent their expected
profits in advance, hoping that the crop would be abundant
and that prices were going to stay high. As the councillors
of the Pirgos branch office of the National Bank of Greece
stated, when asking in 1874 for an increase of the sum
reserved for cultivation loans, the farmers possessed
adequate funds of their own to cater for the running needs of
their vineyards, but they had committed most of their wealth
in the construction of comfortable houses for their o.wn
families and in the expansion and improvement of their
farms. 15
The principal way of unofficially converting short-term
into long-term credit was to convince the Bank and the Patras
merchants to renew cultivation loans for several years.
Wealthy farm owners tried to do so by paying only the yearly

175
interest and by increasing the securities guaranteeing their
debts. The correspondence of the department of the National
Bank of Greece at Pirgos abounds with complaints of the
director about the commitment by customers of the Bank's
funds to planting and the difficulties of exacting repayment
of the capital sum and interest at the expiry date of the
loan. 16 The Bank's customers often declared themselves unable
to meet their obligations, begging for suspension of
reimbursement of the borrowed capital to a later date and in
return for repayment of only the annual interest on the
debt. 17
The problem assumed dramatic dimensions in years of
unfavourable marketing conditions, when the farmers claimed
that the revenue from the sale of their produce could not
even cover cultivation expenses. In such cases the Bank faced
11 An extreme case was that of a priest who "borrowed 6.200 drachmas for cultivation purposes, but spent them in buying land and in planting it, so now that the loan has expired he is in the impossibility of paying back even part of the capital, not having any other source of revenue" {HANBG Pirgos 23/9/1884, n. 25) .
"For instance, in 1870, the P irgos branch managed to collect only 60% or loans advanced during the previous season and was obliged. to renew for anot~er year the remaining 40%; the Director attributed delay of repayment to tne conjunctural depression dominating the local trade {HANBG 28/ll/1870, n.23). Sue. again in 1875, although several successive good seasons had passed, the yearly loans reimbursed within the fixed term did not exceed 60.6% of the entire sum advanced, the Bank being constrained to renew the remaining 39.4% (MA~BG 12/ll/1875, n .16}. Similar complaints were expressed by the Director Megapanos 20 years later, in 1895, stating that although during the preceding 15 yea::s wealthy farmers and merchants realized good profits, they did not agree to regulate their position with the Bank {see HANBG June 1895}. See also HAN3G 1/12/1870, n.24; 20/10/1873, n.ll; 6/10/1873, n.10; 19/11/1873, n.l4; 4/8/~884, n.l8; 23/9/1884, n.25; 12/10/1884, n.30; 24/8/85, n.3la; 2817/1892, n.2la.

the dilemma of either putting the mortgaged farms up to
auction, or of renewing the loan for another year. Usually
this latter solution was regarded as preferable: in addition
to the political cost of judicial seizures, the auctions had
little success, because such unfavourable circumstances also
caused an abrupt decline in the value of the mortgaged farms;
the Bank therefore risked losing its securities without
getting back the borrowed capital. 18 On the other hand, and
especially when the debtors were people of influence, as
often happened, nobody wished or dared to present himself at
the auction. 19
Of course, there was no question of the Bank assuming
direct responsibility for the running of the estates. In
cases where this measure was adopted as a last resort, the
results varied between poor and disastrous, because of the
idiosyncratic character of currant cultivation and the lack
of the required structures on the part of the Bank. 20 Hence
the Bank often found itself obliged to renew the loans to

11See HANBG 1/12/2870, n.24. Ic furthermore transpires from che correspondence of the Bank chat serious leverage was exerced by local politicians on the Headquarters of the Bank in Athens. There is for instance a ecter dated June 1867 by the Director of the National Bank, Pirgos, stating that a bailiff who delivered notice of lawsuits of the Bank against two indebted deput~es was dismissed from service after lobbying by these latter in Athens (see 2/12/1866, n. 6) •
20The Director of the Pirgos branch in 1887 invited the Headquarters in Athens to sell farms belonging to the Bank, because although he tried to supervise cultivation as much as farmers did, he could not obtain satisfactory results (see HANBG 29/4/1887, n.l5). See also HANBG 2/12/1866, n.6; 3/9/1884, n.25b; 6/4/1896, n.20.

insolvent debtors in order to permit them to carry on
cultivation; because if left uncultivated, the mortgaged
farms risked losing an important part of their value. 21
e. The entrepreneurial role of local elites.
The tension characterizing the relations of the Bank with
the wealthy farmers who formed its selected clientele
highlights in reality the important function assumed by
members of the local elite in the process of currant
expansion. By offering their property as a security, they
acted as intermediaries between banking (and merchant)
capital and the direct producers, filling the gap between the
short term credit offered by the former and the long term
exigencies of vineyard creation. 22 In the absence of such
intervention, currant expansion would have probably been
inconceivable, due to the limited development of the credit
market in 19th century Greece.
This role of intermediary offered the wealthy farmers

quite a strong position within the community. As they were
the only persons with resources available for long-term
commitments, they held a virtual monopoly over the creation
of vineyards: And indeed, as demonstrated in chapter I I,
those who purchased national land in Amalias in order to
convert it into currant farms were mostly merchants,
notables, professionals, notaries, lawyers, doctors, priests
and civil servants.
It may therefore be argued that the entrepreneurs of
currant expansion, those who assembled the necessary inputs
and decided on the creation of currant farms, were mainly the
members of the political and economic elite of the currant
growing districts.
As against this, unable to find the required long-term
credit, peasant families could not take on themselves the
creation of new vineyards, except for a stremma or two of
vines planted in their garden; however, as wi 11 be shown
below, they had the option to become owners of vineyards in
exchange for undertaking to plant the elite's farrns. 23
23 Cfr. also Bakounakis "La vigne et la ville: qui finance la culture?" in Dertilis (ed) [1988], p.84: "Le rythme rapide de l'expansion de la viticulture dans le Peloponnese entraine une demande accrue de capitaux, que ne possedaient pas, bien entendu, les cultivateurs."

179
f. Planting agreements: the principal mechanism of vineyard
formation.
Research into the notarial archives and the Mortgage Hall
of Amalias shows that the most widespread way of converting
purchased national land into vineyards was by a special type
of agreements between owners of the land and peasant
families.
Such agreements entailed the concession of land and some
advances (in cash or kind) on the part of the landowner. The
peasant was obliged to perform all the tasks relating to the
establishment of the vineyard; at the end of the first five
years of particular care required by the young vines, the
then established vineyard was divided into two equal parts,
one for the planter and one for the original owner of the
soil. Until division, the landowner took on himself the
payment of the yearly instalments for the redemption of the
land.
A characteristic case of a strategy aiming at the creation
of a large currant vineyard was that followed by
Th. Papailiou, a lawyer from Pirgos. Th. Papailiou "declared"
80 stremmata of national land and purchased the rights of two
other beneficiaries of the 1871 law over 160 neighbouring

180
stremmata. 24 He thus became the owner of 240 adjacent
stremmata of land, 116 of which he ceded to two peasants from
the mountainous province of Mantineia and another 65 to a
peasant from the province of Kalavrita and his three sons.
They were obliged to plant the land with currant vines and to
construct the threshing-floors necessary for the drying of
currants. Papailiou advanced the planters interest-free loans
of 2,135 drachmas and 1,257 drachmas respectively. Five years
later, when the planting process would be completed, the
lawyer was to receive back half of the vineyard and the
threshing-floors, while the other half was to pass to the
full ownership of the planters, on condition they paid back
the advance loan.
The peasants from Mantineia planted the entire area they
received; they did not, however, reimburse the debt and
promised to repay it at 12% interest in the course of the
successive 5 years, without having the right to sell or
mortgage their part of the vineyard. If not, Papailiou would
become full owner of the entire vineyard. The planters also
assumed responsibility to pay the instalments for the
redemption of their part of the estate and promised to
provide for the maintenance and cleaning of the path and the

181
main entrance, which remained the property of Papailiou. 25
The peasants from Kalavrita planted only 37 stremmata and
Papailiou sued them for not having respected the terms of the
contract. Later on a compromise was reached: Papailiou took
18.5 stremmata of vineyard and 4 stremmata of threshing
floors; the planters promised to repay their debt in the
successive 5 years at 12% interest. If not, they would lose
any right to the vineyard. They were also obliged to
construct the path which connected the farm to the main road
and to repair and clean Papailiou's threshing-floors. 26
Terms of most planting agreements consulted in the
archives of Amalias were very similar to the above, except
that in other contracts monetary advances were often
accompanied by contributions in kind. The mayor A. Dalianis
ceded for planting 130 stremmata of national land he had
purchased to three peasants from the village of Dara, also in
the province of Mantineia; besides a loan of 500 drachmas (at
12% interest until completion of the planting process and
division of the vineyard, and at 20% beyond that date), he
promised to contribute to the expenses with 5 casks of wine
and 10,000 canes (useful for propping up the young vines) . 27

In other agreements the landowner offered maize, 28 part of the
timber resulting from the removal of trees found in the
fields destined for planting, 29 or promised to take over the
cost of preparation of the field and permitted the planters
to sow it with maize. 30
g. Planting agreements: cost and benefit for rural
entrepreneurs.
The mechanism of planting agreements presented strong
similarities to that of anticipated purchases of fruit. 3: In
both cases, the original source of invested funds was the
urban merchant and banking capital; and also in both cases,
the channelling of these funds to the local economy was
monopolized by members of the local elite, allowing them to
realize considerable profits.
However, in the creation of currant vineyards, the local
notables played a much more active part than in currant
commerce. In the case of anticipated purchases of fruit,
village merchants acted as mere brokers of credit and bore

little risk, since fruit prices were left "open" until export
and since peasant lenders offered undervalued collateral
securities. But landowners who initiated planting agreements
were assuming at their own risk both the diversion of short
term credit into long term commitments and the advance of
funds to peasant planters without obtaining any immediately
marketable collateral in exchange - such as was fruit in the
case of funds committed to currant commerce.
The cost of a vineyard for the initiator of a planting
agreement may be approximately assessed by analyzing the
terms of the contracts presented above. Although disbursement
was often distributed over several stages, let us accept for
the sake of simplicity that all outlays were advanced in the
beginning of the planting process. National land ceded to
planters cost about 10 drachmas per stremma, plus another
1. 90 drachmas yearly for redemption instalments. 32 The five
instalments payable until the division of the plot between
original landowner and planter, discounted at 20% yearly,
represented at the moment of the conclusion of the agreement
"On the assumption that the ~nit.iator of a planting agreemenc pc;.cc!lased somebody else's rights on the land. If he declared the land himself, i.e. :f :Ce was ancient occupant o.c chose unreclaimed and non-occupied land and up to the limit of 80 stremmata imposed by the Law of 1871, he would pay only the aepos~t and the yearly instalments. On the calculation of costs of purcnase of nat.iona_ land, see chapter II, p.ll9.

184
an expense of 6. 8 drachmas per stremma. 33 The loan granted to
planters amounted to about 20 drachmas per stremma. 34
Therefore, at the moment of the conclusion of the agreement,
the expenses of the owner of the land corresponded to a
capitalized value equal to 36.8 drachmas per stremma, or 73.6
drachmas for each stremma he would receive at the end - since
half the mature vineyard would pass to the planter. 35
Prices of mature vineyards in Amalias recorded in a small
sample of contracts dating from the same period (1877-1887)
ranged between 250 and 533 drachmas and were on average 341.2
drachmas per stremma. 36 Therefore, in the beginning of the
first year of the planting process, the landowner who
financed a planting agreement would have advanced 73.6
drachmas for each stremma he would receive at the end; five

"In the agreements presented above, Papailiou advanced 18.4 and 19.3 drachmas per stremma respectively to the planters. In another agreement, D. Papagiannopoulos promised to advance 100 drachmas yearly for five years to Hr. Antiohos, who undertook to plant currant vines in 20 stremmata of land and to cultivate the fruit trees already existing on the farm: see TR 29/149-15/3/1880. G.Hr. Xidias forwarded 900 drachmas to two planters of 46 stremmata: see TR 57/149-7/12/1897. Unfortunately, the diversity and the nature of contributions in kind stipulated by other contracts do not permit their evaluation in drachmas. However, in those cases monetary advances did not exceed 10 drachmas per stremma: see e.g. cn.2837-20/l/1878.
350f course, when part of the outlay was disbursed later than the first. year of the planting process, the capitalized expense would diminish.

185
years later, he would receive back 40 drachmas which he had
advanced to the planters as an interest-free loan and a
stremma of vineyard of a market value equal to 341.2
drachmas. His original capital would be increased by 518% in
five years, which corresponds to an annual rate of capital
gain of 38.95%. This rate was almost double the profit
realized by the commitment of capital to anticipated
purchases of fruit.
Yet the above calculations - which are of course highly
tentative and have an exclusively indicative value are
based on vineyard prices which refer to years of normal
trade. If the vineyard was coming into maturity during a
cyclical crisis, the owner would be obliged to wait for a
longer period until seeing his property reach its full value
on the market. Amortization of capital committed to the
creation of the vineyard would in that case extend over a
longer period and the yearly increase of the owner's capital
would proportionately diminish.
However, even if currant trade depression constrained the
owner to wait for four or five additional years, his capital
gain would not drop below an annual average of 20%. The
difference between the rate of interest charged on loans
against future deliveries of fruit, which raised to 20%, and
the rate of profit from planting agreements, reckoned here to

186
be almost twice as much under favourable circumstances, may
be considered as a compensation for the risks arising both
from the commitment of short-term credit to long-term
obligations and from the probability of trade depression,
which would cause a delay in amortization of the expenses.
h. The attitude of the peasantry towards property.
An essential condition for the high capital gains obtained
by the initiators of planting agreements was of course that
the peasant planters should tolerate the terms imposed by the
wealthy landowners. In other words, the fact that this type
of planting agreement was widespread in the 19th century
Peloponnese indicates that the peasantry judged them
acceptable, and in exchange for a piece of vineyard property
peasants consented to cede to landowners a very high
proportion of the value they added to the land through their
labour.
Still more than in the case of anticipated sales of the
crop on indeterminate price, where peasant growers assumed
the risks from trade, it is clear that peasants entering
planting agreements did not aim at merely guaranteeing
subsistence, but at the acquisition of property. It can by no
means be maintained that planters accepted the terms of
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


187
landowners by immediate necessity. Peasants assuming the
planting of a vineyard would have to wait several years
before getting any tangible recompense for their efforts. A
planting agreement represented an investment not only for the
original landowner, but also for the planter.
The appetite of the Peloponnesian peasantry for property
seems to have been one of the major elements stimulating the
rapid and relatively continuous expansion of vineyards. The
willingness of peasant planters to accept the terms of
landowners allowed the latter to cover the risks arising from
the instability of the currant sector; such instability,
combined with the defective structure of the credit market,
might have otherwise rendered impossible the quantitative
expansion of currant viticulture. Had the expected benefit
from investment in planting been lower than the average
opportunity cost of capital, vineyard acreage and production
could hardly have increased as rapidly as they did.
On the other hand, property of currant vineyards acquired
by peasants in exchange for planting and taking care of the
landowner's farm may be considered as a very considerable
reward. As suggested above, it was not possible for peasant
families to plant on their own a currant vineyard of
substantial dimensions. By acquiring half of the vineyard
they planted, they managed to increase considerably the
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


188
productivity of their labour; if they had rented the same
farm under a share-cropping agreement, they would have been
obliged to yield half of its produce to the landowner.
Moreover, if planters managed to pay back the original
landowner without incurring other debts, they would come into
possession of a considerable piece of property. If the two
peasants from Mantineia managed to repay their debt to
Papailiou, they would become full owners of a currant
vineyard 58 stremmata large, of a value exceeding 15,000
drachmas. This was a very significant sum, not only for a
peasant family, but even for a notable or merchant. 37
In other words, by undertaking planting agreements,
peasant families were gaining indirect access to fixed
capital, which might be an important step towards upward
social mobility. The importance of this tendency should not,
however, be exaggerated, because it was quite difficult to
repay debts to the original landowner without contracting
other loans and without selling out property. Moreover,
landowners did not allow planters to mortgage or sell out
pieces of the vineyard until they repaid their debt, which
rendered repayment still more difficult. Sometimes, planters
who had received half of the vineyard, subsequently found
37 Examples of planters who managed to reimburse their debt and :o :'iral.Cy become owners of half the vineyard they planted are given by TR 48/62-20/9/1890 and TR 68/149-7/12/1897.

themselves obliged to sell part or the whole of it back to
the original landowner. 38
i. Planting agreements and the development of market
relations.
Planting agreements prevalent in the 19th century western
Peloponnese constituted a drastic move towards the
development of full property rights on the land and of market
relations of landed property. By dividing the newly
established vineyard, both landowner and planter acquired
absolute ownership on their part of the farm, permitting them
to exploit their vineyards without being hindered by
traditional constraints. They might rent, sell, exchange or
mortgage them as often as they wished and under the
conditions they regarded as most profitable.
An illustrative counter-example is offered by the
emphyteutical agreements dominant in the Ionian Islands and
parts of the Northern Peloponnese, similar to the centuries
old contract of enfiteusi widespread in South Italy. 39 These
agreements made no distinction between planting and
38 Eg. according t:o TR 70/53-14/7/1898 a planter sold part of the half of tne vineyard he had received according to TR 63/53-19/11/1895. The planting agreement was TR 48/62-20/9/1890.

subsequent cultivation of the vineyard. Costs of both
planting and cultivation were shared between landowners and
planters; the latter assumed, for themselves and their heirs,
the obligation (and the right) to cultivate the vineyard for
life, in exchange for half the produce. 40 Eviction of the
planter and share-cropper could only occur in the case of the
latter completely neglecting his duties. 41 As a result, the
emphyteutical arrangement implied multiple rights to the land
and stipulated a permanent, binding and complex relation
between the original landowner, the planter and the vineyard.
By not involving such a relation, planting agreements of
the western Peloponnese exposed both landowners and planters
to greater risks, but also greatly broadened their economic
perspectives. By ceding to the planters half of the vineyard,
members of the local elite were withdrawing from the virtual
monopoly they had acquired by concentrating most of the
National Estates. Landowners were thus losing the security of
permanent access to the labour force of the planter and of

in an environment of acute underpopulation and labour
scarcity. In the above mentioned contracts, there are clear
signs of the attempt of Papailiou to impose labour-tying
agreements to the planters of his vineyard, when obliging
them to clean the pathways and the threshing-floors of his
farm yearly. However, the transfer of property to the
peasantry could not fail to further aggravate the lack of
manpower in agriculture.
On the other hand, full ownership rights of the peasantry
were much more easily alienable than the permanent right
stipulated by emphyteusis to cultivate and share the crop of
the landowner's farm. Being obliged to borrow on usurious
terms in the unofficial credit market in order to cultivate
their farm, peasants risked seeing it seized by their
creditor, either the original landowner himself or somebody
else. For instance, the peasants who planted the farm of
Papailiou risked losing any right over the vineyard they had
created, if they did not reimburse their debt. 42 Had they
performed the same tasks under a traditional emphyteutical
agreement, they might have been obliged to reimburse the
landowner by ceding a larger proportion of the produce, but
they would never have lost their hereditary right to

cultivate and share the fruits of the vineyard. 43
Conversely, transferability of property deeds assisted
wealthy and influential families when seeking to create large
and consolidated currant farms. The exploitation of large
contiguous vineyards was much more profitable than that of
parcelled ones scattered around the village, because the
infrastructure of a currant farm - buildings, fences, paths,
threshing-floors, irrigation and draining facilities as
well as the costs of supervision of the vines and of those
who cultivated them, presented considerable economies of
scale. As already indicated by the study of the cession
registers of Amalias presented in chapter I I, farm
consolidation was a primary objective for purchasers of
National Estates.
Alienability of peasant rights over the land allowed
wealthy farm owners to seek consolidation of their farms
through seizure of the adjacent vineyards belonging to their
debtors. 44 More often than not, such transfers of property
appeared in the form of "voluntary" sales, at prices below
those of the market; judicial seizures were less frequent,
"Debts of pla:Jters under emphyteutical agreements were sometimes rer:eweo over several decades. Document n.44 of the Geroulanos family arc~ive registers the evolution of a peasant debt related to a vineyard held under emphyteus~s over no less than 38 years.

though not altogether absent. 45 Besides seizures of mortgaged
assets, another frequent practice was consolidation through
exchange: landowners were often willing to substitute a small
vineyard situated in a distant locality for one adjacent to
their large farm. 46 Moreover, when the planting process was
completed, owners sometimes used to offer to the planters a
vineyard in another locality in exchange for the adjacent
half of the newly planted one. 47
j. Distribution of currant vineyard property.
Large consolidated estates belonging to wealthy and
influential families, the outcome of practices of property
concentration such as those described above, have left
numerous traces in contemporary archival sources. Contracts
of the Transcriptions Register offer plenty of information
about the size and the form of such estates. Individual
notables in Arrtalias, whose land concentration strategies were
studied in detail, owned farms amounting to several hundreds

of stremmata. 48 Another source is the correspondence of the
Pirgos branch of the National Bank of Greece, whose customers
offered mortgages on large currant estates, sometimes as
large as 300 stremmata, as collateral for loans. 49 The
existence of several big currant vineyard farms, two or three
hundred stremmata large, was also confirmed by D.K. Psihogios
during research in the Mortgage Hall of the neighbouring
district of Lehena. 50
' 8The merchant Aristeidis Harvalos effected most of his national land purchases (220 stremmata) in the locality Sferdouklia of the village Kardamas (see TR 13/116-10/9/1874, TR 17/70-29/10/1876, TR 18/83-20/4/1877), most of which he planted with currant vineyards. He appears to have sold at various moments due to financial difficulties and for the endowment of his daughter for a total of no less than 239 stremmata in that same locality (see TR 22/91-1/10/1880, TR 22/92-21/10/1880, TR 27/118-14/3/1884, TR 29/99-18/6/1885, TR 33/167-30/4/1887, TR 20/160-24/12/1887). Later on he took care to exchange 10 stremmata of currant vineyard he possessed in another locality with 10 stremmata of currant vineyard and 10 stremmata of arable land in the locality Sferdouklia and to add to it by purchase another 3 stremmata of vineyard, 12 stremmata arable land, a small house and a well (see 26/107-27/3/1883). From his contracts, recorded in the estate transactions register of Amalias, we know that he also possessed in the same locality another two adjacent one-floor houses constructed in brick, other wells, another house, threshing-floors, an orchard, and sultana raisin vines. In order to consolidate his farm, Th. Karanikolos, merchant from Pirgos, purchased in Amalias no less than 190 stremmata of land already surrounded by vineyards owned by himself (see TR 46/69-1/11/1890). Similar policies were also followed by A. Dalianis, Hr. Xidias and P. Fassos.
"We thus learn that in 1870, the brothers A. & P. Papastathopoulos owned 192 stremmata of currant vineyards, 1,015 olive trees plus another olive garden of 13 stremmata, 69 stremmata of arable and 200 stremmata of unreclaimed land (see HANBG 17/10/1870, n.17); Th. Theodoridis had mortgaged to the Bank 347 stremmata of currant vineyards and 4, 545 olive trees (ibidem.). In 1873, S. Spiliotis owned a currant vineyard of 100 stremmata (see HANBG 20/10/1873, n.11) and in 187 , Al. Vilaetis, of the famous family of Pirgos politicians, possessed a farm of 250 stremmata, adjacent threshing floors and orchards (see HANBG 15/3/1877). In 1884, the merchant :. Makris owned 320 stremmata of currant vines, valued at 100,000 drachmas (HANBG 5/9/1884, n.23); and if production figures are admic:.ed as an index for the size of farms, Avgerinos owned more than 300 stremmata of vines, the mayor of Kalavrita Piohoritis more than 60 stremmata, and a certair. Hr isantopoulos more than 200 stremmata (see HANBG 7/9/1886, n. 24) .
50According to D.K. Psihogios [1987] p.187:"It seems that many followed [the way towards speculative agriculture). There are contracts in the estate property transactions register of Lehena which speak about currant vineyards 200 and 3CC stremmata large. The cheap price of the national land, its payment in the form of instalments, the high prices of currant fruit ... permitted the development of clearly speculative enterprises."
However, the clearly speculative character of these farms and the fact that they used to hire wage workers during the peak-periods of cultivation does not (continued ... )

But although the above examples prove that large estates
were by no means an oddity in the western Peloponnesian
countryside, any accurate assessment of the distribution of
vineyards according to size would require detailed
statistical confirmation. Unfortunately, such a task presents
insurmountable barriers - at least to the possibilities of
any single researcher - because of the lack of an organized
cadaster. 51 Only indirect estimates are therefore possible.
One such estimate may be found in a letter of the director
of the National Bank's office at Pirgos, stating that
customers included in the approved credit list of 1885
possessed 80,000 stremmata of currant vineyards. 52 During the
same period, the province of Ilia produced about 89,000,000
Venetian litres of fruit. 53 If the average product was 600
litres per stremma 54 currant vineyards falling under the
50 ( ••• continued) automatically indicate the prevalence of capitalist relations of production. First, because usually the permanent working force employed in the farm were not wage-workers, but peasant share-croppers - even if a limited number of :arrr,s might have been sporadically operated with salaried foremen. Secondly, because the day labourers employed were not proletarians, but rather peasants occasionally hiring their labour in order to round out their revenue (on this point, see also P. Pizanias [2985]).
"On problems caused by the defective organization of bot!-'. sources ana archives to research on land tenure and property, see abo'.~.~ chapter I~, n.32.
52 HANBG 7/4/1885, n.l2 (Director of the branch of Pirgos to the Headquarters in ll.thens).
''The production of the province of Ilia in 1884 was 89,000,000 litres and in 1887 86,000,000: see appendix IV, p.317 below.

competence of the branch of Pirgos covered an area of 148,333
stremmata. That is, at that particular moment, about 54% of
vineyards in Ilia appear to have belonged to customers of the
National Bank. Since access to credit from the Bank was
restricted to members of the local elite, 55 it ma,y be deduced
that peasant families in Ilia owned less than half the entire
currant vineyard acreage of their district.
Another estimate of the distribution of currant vineyards
by class of owner for the neighbouring province of Trifilia
indicates, however, that the share of the peasantry was not
much below 50%. The director of the branch office of the
National Bank at Kiparissia, in a letter dated March 1894,
reported that due to the crisis affecting currant trade in
that particular year,
" currant cultivation was limited to vineyards
farmed personally by the owners and their families;
the area of such vineyards, added to those which a few
proprietors will be able to cultivate with the aid of
workers, can by no means represent more than half the
entire currant vineyard acreage. " 56

197
It may rightly be concluded that the overall impact of
planting agreements on the distribution of currant vineyard
property was rather advantageous for the peasantry. Given
that most of the distributed national land, on which the
currant vines were planted, was concentrated within the local
elite, the fact that almost half the vineyards belonged to
peasants indicates that notables were obliged to pay a quite
high price for creating their big, consolidated farms. It
moreover indicates that procedures of landownership
concentration and peasant expropriation did not go very far 
although probably, most peasant farms were heavily mortgaged
to merchants and money-lenders. 57
k. The emerging pattern of social relations.
An important factor which permitted the development of a
pattern of currant vineyard property so different from the
one prevalent in the neighbouring Ionian Islands, was the
relative availability and cheapness of the land in the large
plains of the Western Peloponnese, due to under-population
and to the existence of the National Estates. 58 As noted
above, the cost of the land itself represented a minor
57 See Evelpidis [1919].
58 However, ~he custom of dividing the newly pla~~ed vineyard into ~wo par:s was older than the Law of l871: see TR 3/220-4/3/1862.

198
expense for the initiator of a planting agreement. The Ionian
Islands were on the contrary overpopulated and land there was
scarce and expensive - they were typically characterized by
outmigration,_ whereas the currant growing provinces of the
Peloponnese, at least during the second half of the 19th
century, were attracting large numbers of new settlers. 59
Ionian landowners had strong reasons to be less willing to
cede to planters even part of their precious property. 60
On the other hand, wealthy Peloponnesian landowners had
greater difficulties in finding labour willing to plant their
vineyards than their Ionian counterparts. It was probably
this difficulty, together with the difficulty of finding
long-term credit, which obliged them to offer to peasant
planters full property rights on half the vineyard. And as
argued above, in their turn, planting agreements offering to
the peasantry access to vineyard property further accentuated
the problem of labour supply.
The emerging pattern is therefore one of advancing
''see eg. BRCREP Cephalonia 1867: " ... the capacity of production has long since reached its maximum"; also BRCREP Cephalonia 1873: " ... there is nor: a single piece of ground capable of being cultivated which "is nor: soon converred inr:o a vineyard".
' 0A similar trend in the evolution of planting agreements in Sour:ne:n :r:aly was observed for the second half of the 19th century. Due to the increas:ng international demand for wine and citrus, enhancing the profitability of arboreous cultivations and permitting the realization of higher revenues, traditional arrangements such as the emphyteusis tended to be abandoned: landowners were urged to bring the land back under their full property as soon as planting was accomplished, in order to be able to gain immediately the maximum possible benefit (see G. Giorgetti [1974], p.231-232). The great difference is of course that in the Peloponnese, landowners were getting back only half of it.

commercialization of the land, combined with a perpetuation
of the underdeveloped state of the labour market. Peasant
families, favoured by general shortage of labour, got deeply
involved in the strategies of local elites, and managed to
retain and improve their position, not only by participating
in the profits from currant commerce, but also by gaining
access to scarce resources such as fixed capital in the form
of vineyards.

Chapter V. The peasant character of currant cultivation.
A. The tasks of currant cultivation.
The currant plant is an artificially bred vine, requiring
continuous human intervention in order to retain its precious
characteristics and bear fruit. It is not only a question of
providing it with the essential nutritive elements and
humidity, but also of rationing and guiding its development.
When abandoned to nature, the currant vine soon reverts to
its primitive state of wildness (it becomes akamatis or
repsitis) . The grower needs to keep the plant within the
narrow margin between excessive vitality and premature
exhaustion, by following a rigidly prescribed calendar of
tasks. 1
The reconstruction of the currant grower's calendar
attempted in the following paragraphs refers in particular to
the period 1870-1890 and to the large and fertile plain of
Ilia; that is, to the most vigorous period of expansion of
currant cultivation and to the region where production rose
more quickly and higher than in any other one, becoming in
effect a monoculture and provoking the most rapid demographic
1The instability of the characteristics of the currant vine was also tb.e :-na.:n reason for its geographically confined expansion, which gave the southern shore of the Gulf of Corinth and to the seaboard of the western Peloponnese a na:urai monopo y over the production of the small seedless grape (see above chapter :, n. 5}.

changes.
a. Round-digging (xelakoma) and manuring (fouskisma).
This was the first operation in the vineyard after the
harvest, consisting of digging a shallow trench around and
close to the stock of the vine, about 20 em. deep. Round
digging aimed at airing the roots, collecting the rain-water
and the falling leaves (which, when putrefied, become a
useful and cost-free fertilizer) and facilitating the
uprooting of weeds and suckers. But its most important
function was the preparation of manuring, that followed
immediately afterwards. In fact, if the vine did not need
ma~uring, round-digging was usually omitted, so as to spare
time precious for other tasks which would also be performed
in early autumn, such as the preparation of fields for sowing
winter cereals.
Manuring frequency depended on the quality of the soil.
In heavy and fertile soils, too frequent manuring was not
recommended, because it could render the vine wild and
unproductive. In the province of Ilia, currant vineyards were
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


203
dug round and manured once every four years. 2
The most appropriate moment for round-digging was mid
October, preceding the shedding of the leaves and the heavy
winter rains. 3 According to the available estimates, a man
needed one to one and a half full days to dig round one
stremma (0.1 ha) of vines, while manuring needed a half-day's
female work per stremma. 4
b. Pruning (kladokatbaros).
Pruning consisted of two similar but clearly distinct
operations; the first, katharos, which might be translated as
"cleaning", was the cutting away of superfluous branches;
klados, pruning in the strict sense of the term, was the
treatment of the useful branches remaining on the vine after
katharos.
"Cleaning" was one of the most critical steps of currant
cultivation: the number of branches chosen to be left on the
'See cn.883l-19/B/:882; according toN. Branis, expert currant grower fro~ the village of Havari (near Amalias), prior to the introduction o: c:te:nical :ertilizers in the 1960s, round-digging and manurir.g of currant Vlnes was performed once every three to :ive years (information collected ~ocal~y during an interview in January 1989). See also Spiliotakis [1864] p.xxx~x.
'See cn.8843-23/8/1882: "[the tenant} is bound to start round-digging at the beginning or unti the 15th of October". According to N.Bran s the best perioa for t~adi:io~al ro~~d-d~gging and manuring was late October -early November.
'See Hairetis [1883~ p.379; Kalafat.is [1987] p.l68; according toN. 3ran.is, round-digging required one to one and a half days of male worK per stremxa ana manuring required half a day of female work per stremma.

204
vine influenced not only the following crop, but also the
long-term development of the plant. The more branches were
left, the richer would be the harvest; but in the long run,
the production of too much fruit exhausted the vine and
rendered it sickly.
"Cleaning" was often a point of conflict between farm
owner and share-cropper, since it was in the latter's
interest to opt for quick returns, at the expense of the
long-term profitability of the vineyard. For that reason,
share-cropping agreements insisted strongly on the
obligations of the tenant to "clean" properly and specified
that if the owner was not satisfied with the quality of the
share-cropper's work, he had the right to hire specialized
"cleaners", at the share-cropper's expense. 5
On the other hand, exaggerated "cleaning" rendered the
vine too powerful and had effects similar to excessive
manuring. Foliage was favoured over fruit bearing and the
grapes risked containing seeds and becoming coarse-peeled. To
recover equilibrium, after both excesses, required several
years and considerable expense.
"Cleaning" needed much skill and experience; to do it
properly, the grower had to take into consideration not only
the quality of the soil and the general characteristics of
'See cn.2725-12/12/1877, cn.2790-2/l/1878, cn.8865-25/8/l882, cn.89353/9/l882.

205
the vineyard, but also the peculiarities of each individual
plant. Careful observation all the year round and especially
during the harvest was therefore an essential requisite.
Klados, pruning in the strict sense of the term, was the
shortening of the unwanted upper part of the branches left on
the vine after "cleaning". From the point of view of
intensity, the impact of either excessive or defective
pruning was analogous to that of excessive or defective
"cleaning". However, in pruning, the most important parameter
was the timing of the operation. Early pruning speeded up the
growth of the shoots and the ripening of the fruit. This
could be advantageous to the grower, both because early
shipments of fruit obtained higher prices and because early
drying minimized the risk of late August rains, which might
impair the quality or even completely destroy the produce.
But premature blossom might expose the vine to late winter
frosts and thus be of much harm. On the other hand, delayed
pruning exhausted the vine pointlessly, because it deprived
it of that amount of sap which had already risen to the
branches destined to be cut.
Katharos and klados together were the most important form
of intervention in the life of the currant vine, enabling the
grower to gear it to the purposes of commercialized

206
production.
"Cleaning" was ideally to be performed in autumn, before
the complete shedding of the leaves; branches chosen to be
left on the vine could thus benefit for a while from the
circulation of the sap before it withdrew to the roots for
the winter.
In Ilia and in other provinces of the Western Peloponnese
which produced average qualities of currants, "cleaning" and
pruning were performed simultaneously as a combined
operation, called kladokatharos. This practice yielded poorer
results than separate katharos and klados, but was tolerated
because it could be performed in January, whereas katharos,
when performed alone, coincided with the sowing of winter
cereals in November. An experienced pruner needed about 1.3
days to "clean" and prune a stremma of currant vineyard. 6
c. Propping up the stock of the vine (fourkadiasma).
The currant vine, especially when young, needed to be
supported with sticks, in order to acquire and maintain a
vertical position, facilitating the ventilation and ripening
of grapes. Propping up consisted of piercing a piece of reed,
'See Hairetis il883j p.378, Kalafatis [l987j p.l68. But according to N. Bran is, "cleaning" required two days per stremma and pruning 0. 2 days per stremma.

207
adequately prepared, close to the stock of the vine, and in
tying it to the plant with fibbers of osier. The first
operation required about half or a third of a day's work per
stremma and was usually performed by men. Tying was performed
by women and required half a day's work per stremma. 7
d. Hoeing the ground into sods (skafi).
Hoeing provided for the regeneration of the earth by
bringing it into direct contact with the open air, the sun
and the rain. It also destroyed weeds and buried fallen
leaves, whose putrefaction enriched the nutritive elements of
the soil. During the operation, particular attention was paid
to cleansing the vine stock of suckers, especially when
round-digging had not already taken place.
The hoeing of currant vineyards was performed in a very
systematic way. Small conical pits were dug by the hoe, not
deeper than 30 em., in order to avoid damaging the roots. The
dug-up ground was gathered into sods. Pits and sods formed an
irregular surface, much larger than the levelled vineyard.
This larger surface allowed an increased quantity of soil to
come into direct contact with the atmosphere; furthermore,
pits improved the irrigation of the vineyard by holding the

rain water.
In hoeing, the working members of the peasant family were
usually assisted by wage-labourers hired for that purpose;
this operation needed much work and was efficiently performed
only when several people were employed simultaneously -unlike
most other tasks of currant cultivation which could be
executed by a single person. 8
According to Hairetis, during hoeing, workers were placed
in lines, with one worker for each row of vines (kavali) . The
most able were put at either end of the line and advanced
more quickly than those working in the middle of it, who
followed them, thus forming a semicircular curve. The owner
or share-cropper could thus oversee more efficiently the
progress of the work, and could form a clearer idea of the
worth of his workers. Each member of the team collaborated
and followed the pace of his adjoining fellow. When the two
leading workers finished their row, they started a new line
and each of them took either end of it; those working in the
middle, as soon as they finished, came successively to join
them, taking the same position in the new line as in the
'Information confirmed by N.Branis.

previous one. 9
During hoeing, besides overseeing the hired labourers, the
share-cropper was bound to perform several specific tasks.
According to a. share-cropping agreement ( sempria) contracted
in Arnalias in August 1882, the tenants were obliged "to stand
over the labourers in order to clean and cut-off the
unnecessary parts of roots and other similar things emerging
through hoeing ... ". 10
Another share-cropping agreement, dating from September
1877, bears precious information about the labour input
required by hoeing: "[the tenants] promise and are obliged
to perform digging with a double stroke of the hoe
(diploaxinia), so as to spend at least three and a half day's
wages per stremma ... ". 11 This figure is in agreement with the
estimate offered by Hairetis, according to whom hoeing a
stremma of currant vineyard required 3.5 days' wages. 12
Hoeing was performed in late winter, but the exact moment
was chosen carefully: the earth had to be sufficiently dry,
especially when thick and naturally humid, otherwise it would

come out in blocks and no effective mixing would take place. 13
The heavy winter rains should be over, because they might
reduce the soil anew into a compact state. On the other hand,
belated hoeing abbreviated the exposure of the soil to the
open air, so decreasing its beneficial effect. In Ilia, it
was usually performed in late February.
e. Harrowing (skalos).
Harrowing consisted of crushing the sods formed during
hoeing and patiently pulverizing the soil until it was
reduced into a sort of fine powder. Particular attention was
paid to covering the roots and the lower part of the stock
with fresh soil brought up to the surface and exposed to the
open air. Conical hillocks were formed around the stocks, to
protect them from the burning sun of the summer. Moreover,
the complete levelling of the ground had a contrary effect to
that of hoeing: by reducing the area exposed to the sun, it
minimized the evaporation of humidity.
Harrowing had to be carried out with great caution,
because its perfection was an essential requisite for a
successful harvest. Defective hoeing could be rectified by
attentive harrowing; but harm caused by defective harrowing

was irreparable. As a local proverb put it, "even pigs may
hoe, but harrowing must be done by the landlord himself". 14
The labour input for this latter operation depended on the
quality of the soil. The rich and humid alluvial soil of Ilia
was rather easy to harrow and did not require more than one
to one and a half day's work per stremma. 15 But in other
provinces, the same operation required more than two days'
work per stremma. 16
The time appropriate for harrowing also depended on the
quality of the soil. In thin and arid grounds it was
performed in late March or early April, though in thick and
fertile soils it could take place in late April or even early
May. 17
14 Hairetis, op.cit, p.85.

"Hairetis, referring rather to the Northern Peloponnese, esLimates ~i;e labour input required by harrowing at 2.5 to 3.00 days per stremma (Haire~~s, op.cit., p.88).

f. Sulphuring (tniafisma).
The spraying of vineyards with sulphur was intended to
fight the "oi~ium Tuckeri" disease. The use of sulphur was
generalized in 1855, when, after a series of crops destroyed
completely by the disease, sulphuring turned out to be the
only effective remedy.
The first and heaviest sulphuring was usually applied
right after harrowing, when the branches were 10 to 15 em.
long; a man could sulphur up to three stremmata per day. But
effective protection of the vineyard required daily
supervision. If signs of oidium appeared after the completion
of the first sulphuring, the grower had to repeat the
operation a second time, or even a third, depending on the
seriousness of the disease, which was capable of destroying
the crop in a few days. 18 One can thus infer that action
against oidi urn was more intensive in terms of surveying
effort than in the labour required by sulphuring itself.

213
g. Ring-cutting (haraki).
Ring-cutting consisted of carving an annular incision
around the .bark of the stock, 2 em. to 3 em. wide. This
operation was performed after the first sulphuring, when the
vine blossomed in mid-May. It aimed at checking unwanted
vegetation and at stimulating fruit formation by forcing the
sap to stay longer in the upper part of the plant by
retarding its natural flow from the branches to the roots of
the vine.
The adoption of ring-cutting in the late 1840s was
probably the most important innovation ever introduced in
currant cultivation. It was solely due to the spread of this
technique that the expansion of currant growing in the
fertile plains of the Western and the Southern Peloponnese
was rendered technically feasible; until then, the currant
vine, as soon as it was transplanted to rich and humid soils,
turned wild and gave no fruit at all. 19
Ring-cutting was a difficult task which required
considerable effort and skill. The ring-cutter (harakotis),
often a specialized labourer, was obliged to work lying on
the ground and to pay extreme attention to avoid damaging the
inner part of the stock. In deciding on the width of the
"See also chapter 1, p. 23.

214
incision, he had to take into consideration both the age and
condition of the plant and the type of the soil - generally
speaking, the more fertile the land and the more powerful the
vines, the wider should be the incision.
Wrong application could be very harmful both to the crop
and to the vineyard. If excessive, ring-cutting would
prematurely exhaust the vine; and if insufficient, it would
not fulfil its purpose. As was the case with "cleaning",
ring-cutting often constituted a point of conflict between
farm owner and share-cropper, because the latter would rather
opt for intense ring-cutting, favouring the short-term yield
of the vine against its longevity. 20
The time required to ring-cut a stremma depended on the
number of the vines planted per unit area. In Ilia, an
experienced ring-cutter could cut up to 1.3 stremmata a day
on the average. 21 The operation had to be completed in less
than ten days, as otherwise the ripening of grapes would not
be uniform and problems would arise at harvest-time. For all
these reasons, ring-cutting seems to have been, together with
hoeing, one of the few tasks of currant cultivation typically

performed with the aid of hired workers. 22
h. Lopping-off unwanted foliage and tops, supporting the
fruit-bearing branches (xefillisma, vlastologia, tsitisma).
Lopping-off unwanted leaves and shoots was often called
"second ring-cutting" (deutero haraki), because it
accomplished a function similar to that of the former
operation: it constrained the sap to circulate only in those
parts of the vine essential to the development of the fruit.
However beneficial it might be to grape-formation, lopping
needed to be practised with great caution; careless
application would do much harm to the vine, since leaves and
shoots were essential parts of it. Shoots were cut only at
their top; unwanted leaves were only those located below the
bunch; their cutting facilitated air-circulation, without
leaving the bunch exposed to the direct effect of the sun.
Supporting the branches loaded with fruit with sticks of
reed (similar but smaller than those used in propping up the
stock in winter) was the last large-scale job before the
harvest. It aimed at preventing the grapes ~~om touching the
"It is typical that monetary advances promised by farm owners to sha:::-ec:::-oppers for hiring wage labour were to be paid in two instalments, the fi:::-st right before the performance of hoeing and the second right before ring-c~tting: see cr..2725-l2/12/l877, cn.6401-l/12/1880, cn.6449-l0/l2/1880, cr..6~59~C/l2/1880, cn.8792-12/8/1882.

soil and facilitated ripening and picking.
Lopping-off unwanted leaves and tops and supporting the
branches were performed by men and women alike in June and
July, when the entire family of the cultivator was
trar1sferred in the metohi of the currant farm. 23 For that
reason, although the labour inputs required were not
insignificant (1.7 working days per stremma approximately) , 24
they could easily be accomplished by the family labour force,
without the aid of wage labourers.
i. Final preparations for the harvest.
But even after the completion of these operations, the
grower could not take a rest; on the contrary, he intensified
vigilance and watched carefully over his vineyard until the
very moment of the harvest. He corrected the effects of
faulty lopping, propping, weeding, sulphuring. The final
weeks preceding the harvest were the most critical for the
good and uniform ripening of the currant grapes; everything
in the vineyard had to function perfectly, down to the last
detail.
"That lopping was a female job is also shown by the lists of employmer.t of wage labourers in the "Nac.ional Currant Vineyards" near Xilokastro in c.he s;_;mmer of 1830 (see: Archives of the National Financial Society, ELlA, file n.5).

217
The days immediately preceding the harvest were devoted
to the ultimate preparations of the threshing-ground, which
covered at least one-twentieth of the total area of the
vineyard: it was carefully cleaned, levelled, weeds were
burnt; the day before, the threshing-ground was coated with
a solution of ox waste which polished its surface, and so
were the baskets and other containers destined to carry the
grapes.
j. Harvest, drying, cleaning, gathering (trigos, xiransi,
makkinarisma, mazama) .
Crop quality depended much on the maturity of grapes at the
moment of the harvest. But the bunches of grapes in a
vineyard
did not ripen simultaneously and optimum results would be
obtained only if the harvest was carried out gradually, in
several phases. However, very strong reasons compelled the
grower to harvest in the shortest possible time, even at the
cost of compromising the quality of a part of the crop. Most
importantly, shorter harvesting and drying reduced the risk
of rain, which could totally destroy currant grapes,
especially those found on the threshing-ground. Moreover,
harvesting required considerable labour inputs and waiting
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


218
for the full ripening of each separate bunch would further
increase the cost of the operation.
Labour inputs required for the harvest were quite
inflexible. Four female harvesters picked the grapes from the
vines; the bunches were carried by two porters, usually men,
to the threshing-ground, where one female worker laid them
out. Thus, the full utilization of the labour force employed
imposed the formation of harvesting teams composed of seven
workers each. Such a team could harvest about two stremmata
per day.
The harvesting did not last longer than a week, consisting
of six working days. Thus, the seven members of the
harvesting team could harvest up to twelve stremmata and a
farm made up by twenty four stremmata required the
simultaneous employment of no less than fourteen harvesters.
Members of a single family could thus never perform
harvesting on their own and needed to be assisted by wage
labourers.
After the harvest, currant grapes laid stretched on the
threshing-ground for a week or ten days, depending on the
weather. Bunches were every now and then turned over, so as
to dry in a uniform way, while the grower and his family
remained on the alert in order to protect them in case of
rain. But not too much could be done, because technically

available protecting devices were too expensive, such an
expense only being worthwhile for some rare and expensive
qualities of currants. The vast majority of growers were at
the mercy of. the weather, which, needless to say, often
proved pitiless. Disaster caused by rain was recurrent in the
currant-growing regions. 25
After drying, currant grapes were separated from their
stems and gathered. It is estimated that the total labour
input required to harvest, dry, clean and gather from the
threshing-ground the fruit produced by a stremma of currant
vineyard amounted to 5 labouring days. 26 Harvesting was
estimated at 3.5 labouring days per stremma; therefore, if
this estimate is accurate, drying, cleaning and gathering
required another 1.5 days.
"Many popular songs were devoted to disaster caused by Augc:st rains (see ::J. Zografos [1930j pp.94-l01).

B. Form of exploitation and profitability of currant
vineyards.
a. The nature of the labour requirements of currant
cultivation.
The currant grower needed specialized knowledge not only
of the techniques of cultivation, but also of the peculiar
characteristics of the individual vineyard. In order to adapt
cultivation to its needs, he needed to follow its development
over a long time and have familiarized himself with the
behaviour of the vineyard all the year round. Round-digging,
manuring, pruning, ring-cutting, were interrelated operations
with short and long-term effects on the profitability of the
vineyard; decisions concerning their timing and intensity
implied a long-term strategy, which could only be founded on
a good knowledge of the individual farm.
Moreover, currant cultivat ion called for the personal care
of the grower because most operations were very delicate and
lacked any uniformity or standardization. Only somebody with
a personal interest in the crop would perform them properly
by giving them the required attention - either because he
owned the vineyard or because he expected to receive a share

"To put it in other terms, currant cultivation involvea high supervisioc: costs. Following R. Pearce [1983] pp.59-60: "Contracts vary in the difficulty with which they can be implemented. There will be costs involving the time and effort necessary for landowners to ensure an acceptable outcome. I refer to these as supervision costs ... If one makes a distinction between labour "effort" and labour "time" and where the quality of human labour is crucial to the out-turn of production, the ability to ensure the necessary standard of work may be pertinent. Such costs are likely to be most pronounced for the direct employment of labour, whilst any form of rental contract will provide "incentive" to the direct producer to carry out the requisite tasks satisfactorily." Also, o.60: "The magnitude of these potential costs will ... vary with the labour process. In determining the type and range of product, together wit!1 now and wher: produced, the labour process will specify the level and range of skills requisite in production. Where it is such that a wide variety of skills is required - for example, where crop production is largely unmechanised and involves a large number of hand operations - then costs are potentially high. On the other hand, if only a few simple operations are necessary they will be of less significance. It can be argued that, as a general rule, the greater the quantity of labourreplacing capital per unit of direct labour characterising any labour process, the narrower will be the range of skills required."

222
capitalist farms, producing currants by employing wage
labour, would have required a substantially different
technology with less individual and more standardized and
uniform tasks of cultivation. Technically feasible
innovations which would have brought about the
standardization of currant cultivation were the use of
fertilizers and irrigation, 28 the use of the plough instead
of the hoe, 29 sophisticated systems for giving a vertical
position to the vine, 30 the use of devices protecting the
fruit from rain. 31 But according to Hairetis, farm owners did
not introduce these changes because they were too expensive
and because they would have implied the commitment of
considerable additional capital. In fact, it was very risky
for any single farm owner to adopt expensive changes in the
traditional labour process of currant cultivation. As already
discussed in chapter III, the instability of the currant
trade, made greater by the predominance and the opportunistic
practices of merchants, was a deterrent against any
innovative initiative; furthermore, capital could easily be
used in alternative investments, such as money-lending,

223
commerce, or creation of vineyards, occupations with high and
guaranteed profitability.
The peasant family, possessing the appropriate sort of
labour force and ready to remain attached to the vineyard
continuously over a period of several years, appeared
therefore as the ideal currant grower. As suggested in the
previous chapters, tendencies towards property concentration
were strong and big ownership of currant vineyards was quite
common. 32 But non-peasant vineyards were :nostly farmed by
peasant share-croppers. The cultivation of larger farms was
assigned to several peasant families, through share-cropping
agreements which carefully settled the limits of the plot
assigned to each family. 33
b. The prevalent form of share-cropping agreement.
The prevalent form of the share-cropping agreement
stipulated that tenants should perform properly all the tasks
required by currant cultivation, "by their own labour and at
their own expense". The owner of the vineyard kept for
himself the right to control the progress of cultivation and
to correct any imperfection by deducting from the tenant's
32 See chapters l: ana IV.

224
share. On the other hand, the owner was bound to contribute
to the expenses of cultivation by supplying part or all of
the sulphur for sulphuring and the reeds for propping up the
vines and/or by advancing to the share-cropper the wages of
labourers hired during hoeing and ring-cutting. The share
cropper would keep for himself half or two fifths of the
produce, after having reimbursed at 20%-25% interest the
advances made to him by the owner. Share-cropping agreements
were usually expressly or tacitly renewed for several years,
but the farm owner always had the right to evict the tenant
if he was not satisfied with his performance. 34
c. A comparison of share-cropping agreements with directly
exploited farms.
The model budget presented by Hairetis, a farm owner
himself and author of the most authoritative treatise on
currant viticulture, can be considered as a representative
assessment of the average profitability of large farms
directly run by their owners with the employment of hired

225
labour on a year-round basis. 35 According to his estimates,
in a year of normal currant prices, the average output
(gross) of a farm was 124.95 drachmas per stremma and the
average expenses were 68.65 drachmas per stremma
(amortization and interests not included) . That is, gross
revenue of the farm owner amounted to 56.3 drachmas per
stremma, or 45.1% of the gross output of the farm.
In the case of share-cropped vineyards, the revenue of the
farm owner depended on the gross income of the farm and on
the part of the crop he was entitled to, reduced by the cost
of sulphur and reeds. When the produce was equally divided
between owner and share-cropper, the percentage of the gross
income of the farm accruing to the owner was 50%; and if the
tenant kept for himself only two fifths of the fruit, the
respective percentage rose to 60%. The cost of sulphur and
reeds did not exceed 5% of total output. 36 By assuming that
productivity and gross output of share-cropped farms was the
same as in those directly exploited, it may be inferred that
in a year of normal currant prices there was no significant
difference between the average profitability of these two
forms of exploitation.
This conclusion is by no means contradictory with the fact
"Hairetis [1883] pp.378-382.
"See Hairetis, ibidem.
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


226
that share-cropping agreements were a much more common way of
vineyard exploitation than the direct running of the farm by
the owner. The principal characteristic of this type of
arrangement between the farm owner and the direct cultivator
was that, unlike share-cropping arrangements encountered in
other countries or for other crops, only the output of
production was here divided between owner and tenant, while
the yearly inputs were exclusively the responsibility of the
tenant - except for sulphur and reeds. Although the farm
owner financed the monetary expenses of cultivation, at the
moment of the division of the crop, his contribution,
together with interest, was subtracted from the share
cropper's part. And if the output of the farm was not enough
to reimburse the owner, the funds advanced were considered as
a debt of the share-cropper.
The direct cultivator thus undertook the entire risk
arising from currant production. Given the high instability
of the currant trade and the relative inflexibility of
cultivation expenses, this was a very considerable advantage
for the farm-owner, and may easily explain the massive
preference for share-cropping agreements. In years of low
prices or of crop failures, when the gross income of the farm
dropped vertically, the owner directly exploiting his farm
was faced with the risk of serious losses, whereas the owner
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


227
renting out his vineyard to share-croppers only risked
suffering a reduction of his income, and would in no case
suffer any loss.
Moreover, the management of farms directly exploited with
the employment of wage-labour presented serious difficulties.
As stated above, the prevalent technology of currant
cultivation was adapted to the skills and relative advantages
of peasant family labour and not to that of wage labourers
directed by foremen. In the case of vineyards belonging to
the National Bank of Greece, share-cropped ones were clearly
more profitable than those exploited directly. 37 Similarly,
the accounts of monasterial currant vineyards in Aigion
studied by Kalafatis reveal that direct exploitation of
currant vineyards might prove a complete failure. 38
"For example, a documenL of 1891 presents the gross output and gross income of Lhree farms owned by the National Bank of Greece in 1891. Those cultivated by share-cropping agreements yielded to the Bank a benefit amounting to aboGt 50% of the produce, though the directly exploited one yielded only 31.8%. ror thaL reason, the Bank always tended to avoid direct exploitation of its estates (see HANBG snl/1891, n.19a-b).
"See Kalafatis [ l984] "Symmetohikes agrotikes ekmetalleuseis stin Aigialeia " The budget of the farm of the National Bank previously belor:ging to Alexandropoulos in Aigio, referred by Kalafatis [1987], p.l68, preser:ted vec::y good results (revenue of the owner after deduction of expenses representir:g 61.3% of the total output), but profiLed from very low wages (2 drachmas per day for male labourers) and vec::y high fruit prices (300 drachmas per Venetian iitre) and should therefore be considered as excepLional.

d. The profitability of share-cropped farms in Amalias.
The profitability of vineyard farm property in Amalias in
the period of reference of the share-cropping agreements
presented above may be approximately calculated on the basis
of information about prices of currants on the local market,
on the average output of vineyards and on the average prices
of farms. In 1877-1882, Amalias fruit was priced at about 180
drachmas per 1000 Venetian litres; 39 accepting an average
output of 600 Venetian litres per stremma, we reach the
conclusion that each stremma of vineyard would yield to the
owner 51. 2 drachmas, if the agreement was for an equal
division of the produce between himself and the share
cropper, and 62 drachmas, if the share-cropper kept only two
fifths of the produce. 40 During the same period, the average
price of a mature vineyard in Amalias was 350 drachmas per
stremma; 41 the annual return to the owner can therefore be
estimated at 14.6% or 17.7% of capital value respectively.
But a large vineyard could also be presented as collateral
''In 1877-1880 currants of the local description were valuea in rhe marKet of Amalias at 140-220 drachmas {see chapter III, p.l4l).
40 These figures are based on the assumption that the cost c: su~c:1c.:r (amounting according to Hairetis, op.cit., p.379, at 2.8 drachmas per stremxa) was borne by the farm owner. Similarly, the only agreement of rent of a currant vineyard against a fixed sum discovered among the consulted contracts stipc.:lateo that the cultivator should pay to the owner 57 drachmas per stremrr,a year~y (en. 8935-3/9/1882).

on the official credit market, offering the opportunity to
obtain cheap credit which could be profitably employed in
loans to peasant growers. Consequently, the total income
derived from the ownership of a vineyard can be considered
quite satisfactory.
e. The part of the share-croppers.
The fact that in years of normal fruit prices and under
efficient management, currant farms exploited with the
employment of wage-labourers yielded to the farm owner almost
as much as share-cropping agreements, indicates that share
croppers were remunerated for their labour in the vineyard at
the same level as wage-labourers all other costs of
cultivation remaining the same in both cases. Since wages in
the currant sector were notoriously high throughout the 19th
century, 42 it may be deduced that in a year of normal prices,
share-croppers' earnings were quite satisfactory by local
standards.
Of course, this was not true in years of unfavourable
prices, when share-croppers risked not only not receiving
anything for their labour in the vineyard, but also suffering
losses. However, share-cropping agreements presented other
"See chapter VI, below.
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


230
advantages for peasant families which probably
counterbalanced this risk.
First of all, share-croppers might sell their part of the
crop in advance to currant merchants in exchange for loans,
under the same terms as petty owners of currant vineyards
did. 43 Even if it can be assumed that had share-croppers
sought wage employment they would have earned the same, it
would have been impossible for them to receive money in
advance.
Besides, a peasant family undertaking a share-cropping
agreement secured employment for its members even during the
slack periods of the year. This was quite difficult if they
were sent out to work for a wage, because demand for wage
labour was high only during the stress periods of
cultivation. Moreover, a farm share-cropped by the family
could employ even women and children, who would difficultly

231
find wage employment or would receive lower wages. 44
On the other hand, as will be suggested in the following
paragraphs, the employment of wage-labourers during the peak
operations in the vineyard, financed by the farm-owner,
allowed the share-cropper to maximize farmed area which
signified higher revenue and more abundant employment during
the low intensity operations though in the meantime he
dedicated the autumn and part of the winter to the
cultivation of winter cereals.
It may therefore be anticipated that share-cropping
arrangements present a common element with anticipated sales
of the crop on "open" price as well as with planting
agreements: in all three cases, peasant families accepted to
undertake obligations bearing risk, in exchange for increased
revenues. This is an atypical attitude, which will be
discussed into detail in the final chapter of the thesis.
"According to the somewhat simplistic, but interesting testimony of the British consul at Patras: "The peasants, who 20 or 30 years ago almost all led a pastoral life, inhabiting villages in the interior of the Peloponnesus, where, during the summer and autumn, they pastured their flocks on the high table lands of Arcadia and on the slopes of Erymanthus, Taygetus, Hyllene, and other high mountains, have mostly now become landed proprietors as well, for the Government wisely granted great facilities to all Greek citizens for acquiring Government lands in the plains of Achaia, Elis, Messenia, Argolis, & c., wh ch had been lying fallow for years. These facilities were largely availed by the mountain peasants and shepherds, and large tracts which had been long waste and unprofitable have been turned in a few years by these indefatigable workers into flourishing currant and grape vineyards, which all the members of the family, men, women, and ch lcrer, cultivate on odd days and holy days, when employment is not. easily obta.:.ned elsewhere, and thus the amount realised for their produce is almost all profit." (emphasis added) (BRCREP 1891).

232
f. A note on the distribution of tasks of currant cultivation
over the year and winter cereal cultivation.
According to the sequence of tasks of currant cultivation
discussed above, growers were employed in the vineyards on a
full-time basis from January to August. But in the period
from September to early January, they intentionally avoided
performing any important job in the vineyard - except round
digging and manuring, which took place in October only every
fourth year.
Even if most tasks of currant cultivation could only be
performed on pre-established dates, two details show clearly
that this four-month period was deliberately kept free:
first, if round-digging in October had been carried out on a
yearly basis - which would in any case have benefited the
vines 45 - hoeing would have required less effort and labouring
days in February; on the other hand, if separate "cleaning"
had been carried out in autumn, time would have been spared
in January, when kladokatharos, combined cleaning and
pruning, was performed. But in neither case did this normally
happen in practice.
As already argued in chapter I, the peasantry kept this
time free from any duty in the vineyards in order to
"See Hairetis, op.cit., pp.40-4l.
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


233
cultivate winter cereals. Wheat, barley and oats, ploughed
and sown in October and harvested in June, did not coincide
with any of the peak moments of currant cultivation:
September and October tasks were postponed to the end of the
winter; in June most of the spring tasks in the vineyards
were already finished, and those remaining until the
preparations for the harvest (lopping-off unwanted foliage
and tops, propping up the fruit-bearing branches) were
usually performed by the female members of the family. 46
It should be noted that the employment of wage-labourers
during hoeing, and sometimes even during pruning, at the
charge of the share-cropper but with cash advanced by the
farm owner (who would keep it from the share-cropper's share
in August, increased by 20-24% interest), greatly facilitated
these modifications in tasks of cultivation. If share
cropping families were obliged to do all the work on their
own, more strenuous hoeing in March because of omitted round
digging in October would reduce the total vineyard area they
could farm during the rest of the year.
"See also G. Delille [1977] p.ll9: "[c' ~una] perfetta complemenr:arita era coltura della vigna e coltura del grana i cui lavori si svolgono in periodi deversi, il che basterebbe a spiegare la lora frequente associazione nel quadro della piccola proprieta contadina".

234
g. The use of wage-labour in peak operations.
Wage labour employed on a large scale in specific
operations, hoeing, harrowing and harvest, did not in any
sense contradict the overwhelmingly peasant character of
currant cultivation, nor did it constitute any development
towards the establishment of capitalist relations of
production in the 19th century Peloponnese. On the contrary,
the employment of wage-labourers during peak periods of
cultivation allowed share-croppers to maximize the area they
cultivated, thereby reinforcing the productivity of family
labour and increasing its revenue.
According to table V.l, yearly cultivation of a stremma
of vineyard required 15 to 17 labour-days. However, the
distribution of these labour-days over the year was unequally
and rigidly structured. As suggested above, all tasks, except
round-digging and manuring, were concentrated in the eight
months' period from January to August, and none of them could
be extended too much in time, either because they had to be
performed at a specific moment of the development of the
plant and under given climatic conditions, or merely because
they could not overlap with the operation following
afterwards. Currant cultivation was, besides, overwhelmingly
a man's occupation, and therefore the area which could be

235
farmed was determined by the available adult male labour of
the family. 47
As is clear from table V.1, the heaviest task in winter
was hoeing, and the harvest in summer. This plainly explains
why it was precisely in those operations that wage-labour was
massively employed. According to estimates, without the aid
of wage-labourers, a peasant family with two adult working
members would not be able to hoe more than 10 stremmata. 48 It
is obvious that to prune 30 stremmata of vines during January
or ring-cut them during May would have been meaningless, if
in February the family did not manage to hoe more than 10
stremmata. By contrast, the same family helped by wage
labourers in hoeing could normally farm about 30 stremmata,
provided its working members were fully occupied with currant
cultivation. 49
High profitability of currant viticulture was of course
"Kalafatis [ 1987] states that in Aigio even heavier work, such as hoeing, was sometimes carried out by women. But this does not seem to have been the rule, at least during the 19th century. For instance, the lists of employment of wage labourers in the "National Currant Vineyards" near Xilokastro in the summer of 1830 register a very neat distinction between male and female tasks and wages. Moreover, no female name is found among the list of workers performing male tasks, nor the opposite (see: Archives of the National Fir.ancial Society, ELiA, file n.S). Also, Anagnostopoulos & Anagnostopoulos !1939] p.21, scate that in ::he interwar period, workers from Beotian villages moving to the plain Vocha of Corinth in order to hoe the currant vineyards were only male. Information about the employment of women in heavy duties exists only for the eariy 2Ctn ce~tury, wnen massive emigration to the USA created extremely acute labour shortages: see BRCREP 1906, quoted in n.77, p.248 below.
"See also ?sihogios [1987] p.l80.
"This indirect calculation based on the dat.a presenceo on c.able V. ~ ·was fully confirmed by the currant grower N. Branis.

236
an indispensable condition for the employment of wage
labourers. 50 In its turn, the employment of wage labourers
contributed to raising productivity by rounding the stress
points of labour requirements of currant viticulture - the
only alternative would have been that of introducing
technological innovation. 51
The use of migrant labour did not increase production per
work-day, which could be the definition of labour
productivity under conditions of an integrated and flexible
capitalist labour market; it increased production per adult
male member of the peasant family, which is a far more
relevant definition of labour productivity under conditions
of a peasant economy. Moreover, it was not the surplus-value
created by the labour of the migrants that increased the
profitability of the peasant farm; it was its high "marginal
yield", due to the fact that it allowed the members of the
family to be fully employed in currant viticulture during the
50 High revenues because of intense urban demand is the main explanat.iof', offered by Chatelain for the use of migrant wage labourers in viticul::ure (p.:09): "D'autre pare, la vigne est une culture riche qui ger;eralement "paye"
bien car le vin est recherche par les consommateurs urbains en un siecle ou les villes se developpent; la vente est facilitee aussi par les nouveaux moyens de transport, chemins de fer surtout. Aussi le vignoble attire le numeraire: non seulement le vigneron ne sera pas ou rarement un migrant temporaire, mais le
vignoble est a l'origine de la formation d'une classe rurale aisee, une sorte d'aristocratie dans le monde paysan. Cette class sociale, pourvue de numeraire,
n'hesite done pas a faire appel a certaines epoques de l'annee a ae gros contingents de travailleurs assez bien renumeres puisque le profit le permet; ainsi, le grand vignoble devient un facteur de migrations temporaires regulieres."

237
less demanding, in terms of labour, tasks of cultivation. 52
h. Seasonal migrants.
Not surprisingly, most of the labourers hired during
hoeing and harvest were seasonal migrants. This was a result
of the advanced specialization of the population in currant
growing: since most peasant families preferred (and were
offered the opportunity) to own or share-crop currant
vineyards, no additional labour force was available locally
during the peak periods of cultivation and wage labour had
therefore to be provided from other regions. 53
"on the problem of rounding the stress points of labour requirements of agriculture, similar to the problem of "bottlenecks" in modern economics, see Gerard Delille [1977], p.l21-122: "Il numero di giornate lavorative traduce dunque, in modo generale, un valore massimo della produttivita, mentre il numero di giornate ai momenti pill cruciali delle operazioni agricole ci da un valore minima. E questa secondo risultato e certamente quello pill vicino alla realta. Siamo nel cuore del problema; il progresso, per quanta riguarda la produttivita consiste, in un prima momenta, nel rompere queste punte acute che mobilitano un gran numero di uomini: la falce al posto del falcetto, 1' aratro al posto della vanga, il bue al posto del uomo, il cavallo al posto del bue . . . . Si tratta di un problema capitale in quanta, ci sembra, e 1' esistenza di queste variazioni che spiega, nel quadro di un certo tipo di agricoltura, 1' esistenza dei di versi rapporti di produzione, la strutturazione sociale e i comportamenti demografici."
"Interesting comparisons could be attempted on the subject of temporary migration with French viticulture of the 19th century. Abel Chatelain, in his Les
migrants temporairesenFrance de 1800 a 1914, p.l08, confirms that "iles progres de la culture de la vigne] s' accompagnent d' un besoin accru de main-d' oeuvre. En effet, la vigne est une culture absorbance, exigeant beaucoup de bras. Or, es t~ches sont intermittentes, ce qui pose alors un probleme de migrations temporaires de travailleurs si les regions viticoles n' ont pas des densites humaines suffisantes." Chatelain specifies that in the French case ·we car: distinguish between two major kinds of vine migrations (p.l09): "On y distingue d' ailleurs deux sortes de migrants saisonniers: les "montagnols" ou defricheurs dont le sejour, en hiver, est le plus long et les vendangeurs appeles en septembre ou en octobre." In the case of currant culture, there is an analogous distinction between late winter-early spring migrants - those coming to hoe and harrow the vineyards, and August migrants those coming for the harvest. Unfortunately, no information is available about possible differences in the origins of hoers and harvesters.

238
The seasonal migration of labourers was a regular
phenomenon in the Peloponnesian countryside, favoured by the
very proximity of the fertile coastal lowlands to arid
mountains and land-thirsty islands. In 1855, Efimeris tis
Ellinikis Georqias [Journal of Greek Agriculture] complained
that nowhere in the lowlands were there sufficient labourers
to perform the necessary tasks of agriculture, except in the
mountain provinces, where population was dense. 54
Already at that date, currant viticulture attracted a
great part of the overall seasonal migration, and wages
depended to a great extent on labour demand in the currant
sector: according to the author of the article, a relative
abundance of labourers had prevailed only in the years when
the blight (oidium) destroyed the currant vineyards; and as
soon as sulphuring spread and currant cultivation resumed, it
was not long before wages doubled and the acute labour
shortage reemerged.
Of at least equal importance to the highland provinces of
the Peloponnese, were the Ionian Islands, another traditional
point of departure for several thousands of seasonal
migrants. As stated by the local British authorities,
seasonal migrants moving to the continent participated in
cereal cultivation as well as in the hoeing of vineyards in
""Peri tis Georgias", Efimeris tis Ellinikis Georqias vol.A, n.2, November 1855, p.132.

239
spring and in the harvest in August, and usually brought back
the fruit of their earnings in the shape of corn, which was
a valuable contribution to the deficitary grain balance of
the Islands. 55
Although the currant growing provinces experienced rapid
population growth, 56 the number of seasonal migrants gradually
increased and they began to come from further afield. 57 There
is information about the arrival of Italian families coming
from the east coast of Italy in 1878. 58 In 1886-1890, when
several thousand labourers attracted by the construction of
railways and of the Corinth canal came from as far as
Montenegro, Dalmatia and Turkey, they were easily able to
find seasonal employment in digging the vineyards. 59
"See BRCREP Cephalonia 1864. The report from the same island for the following year 1865 stated that "the greater or lesser numerical concourse of agricultural labourers to Continental Greece is determined by the demand for hands required for the cultivation of the grain and currant crops", and that "the annual demand in this way is ... increasing" (BRCREP Cephalonia l865) . S~milar observations '..Jere made by consul Woodhouse for the island of Zante in 1865: "The grain grown in the island is good, and suffices for about three months, being principally consumed by the rural population, but the labouring classes usually subsist for two months more on the corn which they receive in the Morea in exchange for their labour during the spring and autumn ... " (BRCREP Zante 1865). The same view is confirmed on the continental side: "The vine-culture is chiefly carried on by Cephaloniotes and peasants from Zante, who live frugally, and carry back the reward of their labour in kind." (BRCREP Athens 1859); "[great] number of Ionians come over every year to the Morea during the fine season. At Patras alone as many as 2500 come during the year, and return to their homes after a few months." (BRCREP 1859).

240
The increasing requirements of currant viticulture for
seasonal migrant labour confirms that there was no tendency
towards the formation of a local labour force depended on
wage employment. Most families settling in the lowlands
planted or share-cropped additional vineyards; as a result,
they could fully employ their members in the family farm, and
were not seeking wage-employment. On the contrary, they too
called on migrant labourers during the periods of hoeing and
harvesting, as native growers did; for each additional family
of currant growers, more than one islander or mountaineer
were added to the seasonal migrant labour force. 60 A
multiplier effect was thus created, and instead of relieving
the shortage of labour, population growth, together with the
expansion of vineyards, generated increasing needs for
external labour during the peak periods of cultivation.
On the other hand, recourse to seasonal migrants, in
addition to easing the wage-labour shortages o£ the currant
growing provinces, also constituted a solution for the
labourers' regions of origin, which suffered from lack of
land and capital resources. The high wages offered in the
currant growing provinces constituted a valuable additional
revenue for mountaineers and islanders, and probably critical
RThere are no positive proofs that peasants permanently settling in the currant growing provinces were ex-migrant labourers. The fact that both movements originated from exactly the same regions (the Ionian Islands and the mountains of the Peloponnese), reinforces, however, such an assumption.

to the equilibrium of their households. As a result, lasting
patterns of complementarity were created between the plain on
the one hand, the mountains and islands on the other, and
movements of seasonal migration survived until well into the
20th century.
As late as in the inter-war period, when the impetus of
currant expansion had long since died down, 10% of the
peasant population of Domvraina and other villages of Beotia
(about 700-800 labourers in all) continued to move in spring
to the plain of Vocha in the opposite shore of the Gulf of
Corinth in order to hoe currant and grape vineyards.
Immediately afterwards they would go back in order to hoe
their own vineyards, which, located at a greater altitude,
required hoeing somewhat later: 61 an instance of the fact that
seasonal migrants were peasants seeking to arrange their
activities so as to complement their meagre revenue, rather
than proletarians. 62
"A similar pattern of a cy le of peasant migrations rendered poss.:.b~e by the different timing of tasks of cu tivation in plots sit~ated in differe~t alc:~~des is described by 0. H. Hufton [ 974].

i. Expensive and unforeseeable wages: a factor favouring the
reproduction of the peasant character of currant cultivation.
As a result of the structure of labour supply, the wages
of agricultural workers were high and had a tendency to
increase. According to the agricultural census of 1860 the
average remuneration of agricultural wage labour in Greece
was 1.66 drachmas plus meals, though at the same time the
respective figure for France was 0.81 francs (equivalent to
0. 91 drachmas) . At the same date, wages in the currant
growing provinces were decisively higher than the average. In
Patras, the maximum was 2.80 drachmas and the minimum 1.70,
in Aigion 2.50 and 2, in Ilia 3 and 1~50 drachmas, in Corinth
2. 50 and 1. 8 0. 63
According to the data presented on graph v. 1, based on the
annual reports of the British consul at Patras, wages in the
northern-western Peloponnese rose considerably together with
the expansion of currant viticulture. 64 A figure already

considered very high in 1859, increased by 50% until 1884,
though neither the average price of currants, nor that of
foodstuffs followed any similar trend. 65
In addition to being high, agricultural wages were also
characterized by their variability and unpredictability,
precisely because they depended on the arrival of labourers
from distant regions. As commented by the author of the above
mentioned article in Efimeris tis Ellinikis Georqias of 1855,
wages were not proportionate to demand - depending on the
annually cultivated area - but were determined by the massive
or gradual, sufficient or insufficient arrival of temporary

mig'rants to the one or the other province. For instance,
random factors such as the precipitation of rain increased
wages by postponing cultivating work; farmers were obliged in
that case to pay not only for the travel costs of the
workers, but also for the weather inconveniences and the lost
day's wages. 66
The movement of wages in the years 1884-1891 is
characteristic of the precipitous influence that conjunctural
events might have on a labour market which deper1ded on
irregular supply. Following the agreement between the Greek
government and its foreign debtors in 1879, the Greek state
was again able to contract loans in the European capital
markets. 67 This permitted the undertaking of considerable
public works which aimed at the ~provement of
infrastructure. The most important of them, the construction
of t~e railway linking Athens, Corinth and Patras and the
excavation of the canal of Corinth, started in 18 82. 68
Public works resulted in an increased demand for wage
l'abour and could not fail to produce an increase in tfle
already high agricultural wages, notwithstanding the increase
in labour supply by several thousands of workers attracted

reported that as a consequence of a variety of public and
municipal works carried out in Ilia, wages for digging the
vineyards reached as high as 7. 50 drachmas a day. 70 High wages
continued until 1886. But in 1887, most public works slowed
down due to various reasons. 71 In that year, perhaps for the
first time since the establishment of the Greek state "the
price of labour has been cheap, say ls6d to 2s per day for
agricultural labourers, in consequence of those men who had
been working at the Corinth canal being temporarily
dismissed." 72 And although public works resumed, this
exceptional conjuncture continued until 18 90, due to the

arrival of numerous Turkish and Bulgarian peasants, who
sought employment in the currant vineyards. 73 However, it was
not due to last for long: by 1891, agricultural wages rose
again, and almost reached their pre-1880 levels. The British
consul could optimistically comment:
"The conditions of the labouring classes and peasantry in
the Peloponnesus are very satisfactory. Poverty is unknown
to them, for, owing to the sparse population and the large
amount of labour required for the cultivation, preparation
and shipment of currant crop, wages are very high. " 74
After 1893, due to the currant trade crisis, wages
declined again. 75 But massive emigration to the USA - the main
reaction of the peasantry to the fall in its revenues due to
the currant crisis 76 - did not take long to push them to their

BRCREP 1894: "The consumption of salted codfish had increased rapidly during the years of prosperity amongst currant growers, but latterly, in consequence of the reduced wages of labourers and of the rise on exchange, the article has been beyond the reach of the poorer class" (emphasis added).
''As A. Kitroeff [1990], p.14-15, rightly poi!'lts out,"the currant crisis of the 1890s did not manifest itself as a sudden crash. Rather, it was a long, dra~n out process that lasted almost a decade, as government promises to guarantee prices, plans to encourage local wine production and other ways of using currants shored up hopes of a long term solution"; thus "the permanency of the problems was confirmed at the turn of the century". In fact, emigration "took off" after 1902 (see ibidem, table l, p.7) and most migrants originated from the ?eloponnese. It should be noted, however, that according to the data fur!'lisned by Kitroeff, the primacy did not belong to the currant growing regions themselves, but rather to the regions which used to send out seasonal migrant (continued ... )

traditionally high levels. 77
It may rightly be concluded that high agricultural wages
were a long term characteristic of Peloponnesian agriculture,
and that exceptions like that of the years 1887-1890 merely
confirm the rule, by demonstrating that only the arrival of
migrants from very distant regions might ease local labour
shortages - a solution only sustainable under very particular
circumstances, such as was the construction of public works.
In its turn, underdevelopment of the labour market, the
deeper causes of which will be examined in greater detail in
the next chapter, greatly favoured the reproduction of the
peasant character of currant viticulture. As long as labour
supply was expensive and wages in the season to come were
completely unpredictable, wealthy farm owners had obviously
no alternative but to entrust planting and cultivation of
" ( ... continued) labourers. The nomos of Arcadia - which included the bulk of the mocntai~ous regions of the Peloponnese, sent thousands of seasonal migrants to the lowlano vineyards but did not produce any currant at all - was the Greek region which registered the highest percentage of emigrants in comparison to its population: no less than 15.10% between 1890 and 1911. The southern Ionian Islands, a curra~t growing region but also a major point of departure for seasonal migrants, was second, though the nomos of Achaia & Ilia, which included the most important ct:rrar;~ growing provinces, those of Aigion, Patras and Ilia, was only eigh:..f'., witn 6.11%.

Chapter VI . Labour productivity, capital accumulation and
the dowry.
A. A model of peasant economy in the Peloponnese.
As noted in the introduction, D. K. Psihogios was the
first scholar to try to provide a comprehensive explanation
for the behaviour of the peasantry in currant growing
provinces. 1 The guiding assumption of his analysis is that
peasants never reason in terms of commodities, but always in
terms of use-values. 2 Unlike many other Greek historians, who
accept that a limited degree of market involvement was
desirable as a means of diversifying the activities of the
family, 3 Psihogios's view is that commercialization of the
output of peasant labour could only occur through extra
economic coercion (taxes and duties), or out of sheer hunger,
and that the principal objective of the peasant family was to
secure subsistence through autarky, in particular by
producing enough grain to cater for its own consumption. 4
On the grounds that currant vineyard acreage never
exceeded 25% of the total cultivated area, and that peasants

produced grain, wine and olives in addition to currants,
Psihogios refuses to accept that currant cultivation ever
became a "monoculture". 5 He suggests that currant cultivation
was an answer to declining cereal yields per unit area and
that it finally led to an improvement of cereal productivity,
because cash income from the sale of currants allowed peasant
families to introduce the use of horses and iron ploughs in
cereal cultivation. 6 The pursuit of autarky is also the main
explanation he gives for the colonization of the
Peloponnesian plains: while accepting that there is an
association between provincial rates of population growth and
regional development of currant viticulture, he considers
that grain exerted a stronger influence on the decisions of
migrants than did currants. 7
As regards the structure of the peasant family, Psihogios
argues that the prevalent pattern in the Peloponnese and in
Continental Greece was virilocal establishment of the young
couple and that the complex household thus created split

Witness the minuscule grain yields recorded within the small southern state in 1860 . .. Although no census was taken, other sources indicate a growing subdivision of holdings already under 5 ha in the face of increasing population and no primogeniture.

apart into nuclear households at the death of the family head
and with the division of the inheritance. 8 Essential to the
reproduction of this family structure was the institution of
the dowry, in the absence of which marriage was unthinkable
in 19th century Greece. As the person responsible for the
arrangement of the dowries of his children, the family head
was able to control their marriages and to keep the
elementary families of his married sons tied to the paternal
household. 9 And since the larger a household, the more
adapted it would be to the pursuit of self-subsistence, the
aggregative effect of the dowry might be evaluated in
positive terms - were it not for its serious negative aspects
in that the bride's family lost both resources and a
productive worker, without receiving anything which could
compensate this loss. In addition to this shortcoming, there
is the fact that after the death of the father and the
division of the inheritance, no son wished to contribute to
the accumulation of the dowries of his brothers' daughters,
and for this reason the same institution led to "premature"

division of the complex household. Psihogios uses as a term
of comparison the zadruga, where marriage is attended by
bridewealth, not by dowry. 10 The latter system is considered
more efficient, both because bridewealth compensated the
family of the bride for the loss of a productive worker and
because it led to larger, and therefore more economically
robust households.
During research in the archives of Lehena village,
Psihogios discovered that the value of dowries had a tendency
to increase throughout the second half of the 19th century 
especially of those dowries concluded between peasant
families. The element which increased was usually cash, or
rather the monetary debt of the bride's father to the groom. :1
The effort to provide for ever increasing and progressively
monetized dowries is held to have led to a further
enfeeblement of the "household mode of production" and to its
10 ibidem, p.151. On the zadruga, see Byrnes (ed) [1976].
11 Psihogios conducted an inquiry on 106 dowry contracts found in the Mortgage Hall of Lehena village (near Amalias), dating from the period 185 -1905 (Psihogios [1987] pp.l72-l83). As he points out, dowries registered in the Mortgage Hall correspond to no more than a small fraction of the total number of marriages which occurred during the respective period, probably because most families judged private agreements in front of a teacher or priest sufficient:y authoritative and preferred to avoid notarial expenses and stamp duty. In several cases, dowry contracts were signed and registered in the Mortgage Ha~l severa~ years after the marriage had occurred (op.cir:. pp.l72-l80). Ir. Ama:ias :oo, i: was a frequent practice to omit the registration of a dowry agreement in a forma: document at the moment when marriage occurred: see eg. TR 29/129-4/9/1885, ':.'R 3/44 (later series: Elissis) - 9/l2/l909. This practice was not seldom fol~owed even by elite famiL.es: TR 31/27-3/4/1886 (Fassos family). Psihogios did not c:.ake such delayed agreeme:1ts into account, because they were often dictated by irrelevant purposes and were therefore subject to biases. In particGlar, the inalienable quality of dowry property was an effective weapo:1 agains: confiscation.

final subsumption to capitalism, effected through the
increasing transfer of resources to money-lenders for the
payment of interest on dowry loans and through the "transfer
of surplus in the form of manpower through transatlantic
migration". 12
B. An alternative model.
a. Why do the peasants usually avoid markets ?
A more qualified explanation for the widespread tendency
of peasants to avoid markets is offered by M. Aymard in his
article "Autoconsommation et marches: Chayanov, Labrousse ou
Le Roy Ladurie ?". 13 Criticizing the assumption that pre~
capitalist rural economies moved gradually from autarky to
fully-fledged commercialization, Aymard stresses that neither
of these two opposite poles ever existed, and that peasants,
although they probably considered autarky as an ideal
situation, always found themselves obliged to pass through at
least four distinct markets in order to secure subsistence:

13M. Aymard [1983]. This article is often referred to in recent Greek historiography as oeing relevant to the notion of "subsistence through m~:tip~e activities" (see introduction, p. 3). Aymard' s remarks are very probab~y appropriate to Greek subsistence agriculture in the 19th century. But as : try to show in the following paragraphs, they do not apply to export-oriented c~rrant monoculture.

the market for agricultural products, the land market, the
money market and the labour market. 14 But rather than to any
obstinate a priori rejection of the acquisition of use-values
through exchange with commodities, the negative attitude of
the peasantry towards markets is ascribed to the fact that
the latter's hierarchical and monopolistic structure usually
imposed very unfavourable terms on direct producers and
deprived them from drawing any benefit from participation in
market relations. 15
In its turn,

Malgre les sollicitat ons de l'economie monetaire, le malthusianisme des individus et des "entreprises" vient confirmer la rigidite et 1 'inelasticite d'ensemble du systeme" (emphasis added). It may be assumed that the author does not preclude the possibility of a more positive attitude of the peasantry towards markets if - and when - accumu~ation was feasible to it.

But this was by no means the case in Peloponnesian currant
viticulture as it was not in French peasant farms
specialized in wine production. 17 It is true that village
merchants and exporters controlled the commercialization of
the crop and often managed to draw considerable benefits by
speculating with prices, dates of delivery and quantities of
currants; it is also true that the structure of the credit
market did not favour peasant growers, who were obliged to
pay usurious rates of interest on loans backed by undervalued
collateral securities. However, the exceptional conjuncture
of increasing international demand for a commodity which was
a natural monopoly of the Peloponnese, the production of

Cosi, anche senza nessun cambiamento al livello delle tecnniche agricole propriamente dette, il Mezzogiorno francese ha potuto aumentare la produttivita globale della sua agricoltura."

preferably peasant - labour in an environment of acute labour
shortages, increased the productivity of the peasant families
and allowed them to obtain not insignificant benefits from
their involvement in the market economy. 18
As a result, Peloponnesian peasant agriculture, instead
of under-employing available factors of production as is
usually the case in subsistence economies, not only tended to
fully utilize its own labour and capital resources in currant
18As noted above, Psihogios suggests that the expansion of currant cultivation was not a positive response to market opportunities, but rather a reaction to declining land productivity. This argument is based on the detection of a decline in cereal yields per unit area between 1860 and 1875. However, data on cultivated area are not accurate enough to support any conclusion on land productivity. It should be recalled that accurate data on acreage are scarce even for an entirely commercialized crop such as were currants (see chapter I, above). National figures of cultivated area - and of output - for a produce such as grain, largely consumed at home, should be considered still less reliable. The study of the evolution of grain yields would require detailed studies, at a level of aggregation much lower than the national one. Psihogios's hypothesis is also weakened by the fact that rapid currant growth preceded 1860 by at least thirty years. Moreover, in the years 1860-1869, that is, during most of the period of the presumed decline of cereal yields, currant cultivation expanded at the slowest rates recorded for the entire era of currant growth (1830-1893). The second part of the argument is that income from the sale of currants served principally to finance technological improvement of grain production. But this suggestion does not conform well to the existing historical evidence either. Already in the early 19th century, peasants are reported to have been using manure exclusively in currant vineyards and not for cereal cultivation (see n.6 p. 19 above). At the end of the century, contemporary observers still deplored the low technological level of arable agriculture in the Peloponnese. See eg. BRCREP 1892: "It is much to be desired that greater thought and attention be directed towards the growing of cereals in this district; but, as stated before, the peasantry have devoted all their energies to the growing of currants, and all other branches of industry and husbandry are neglected"; BRCREP 1893: "No steam ploughs or other improved agricultural implements are employed in the Morea, the cultivation of grain crops being carried on very much in the same style as was no doubt practised in the days of Hesiod"; BRCREP 1894: "The cultivation of cereals in this country is carried on in the most primitive way, and is, therefore, not remunerative". If the peasantry had cultivated currants in order to finance improvements in cerealiculture, after several decaaes o: currant growth, such improvements would have been at least perceptible. "~ is ~~" altogether to be excluded that the expansion of currant viticu!tu~e was associated with some change in cereal cultivation, in particular in the arable fields privately owned and situated close to the vineyards. In those fields, it was necessary to apply some practices providing for the maintenance of t.he natural fertility of the soil, which no doubt represented a shift from :ormer practices of wild cultivation. Bu this was a side effect of currant expansion rather than its cause. Moreover, t does not seem to have had any particularly decisive impact on technological mprovement and yields.

257
specialization, but also attracted additional manpower from
surrounding communities and credit from the international
money market. Moreover, these resources were committed in a
way which rendered Peloponnesian agricultural production
internationally competitive, by financing the conversion from
technologically backward and unproductive cerealiculture to
profitable currant viticulture, which enjoyed an expanding
international demand. 19
"Rather than taking into account considerations about relative advantages and disadvantages, Psihogios argues, considering it as an important. reasor. :or currant expansion, that the creation of currant farms was more feasible :or peasant families than the acquisition of a pair of oxen required for cereal cultivation (ibidem p.40 and Psihogios [1986] p.l57). But a pair of oxen did not. cost. more than 260 drachmas (see Psihogios [1987] p.48, n.9 and p.49). This was not an insignificant sum, but it was incomparably lower than 2,500 drachmas which was the minimum value of an hectare of currant vines (an hectare being the area which could be cultivated by a peasant family, with two male adult members, without the use of hired labour in hoeing). Psihogios himself admits in several parts of his exposition that to plant a currant vineyard larger than two or three stremmata and to wait until it came to produce fruit involved considerable expense (eg. Psihogios [1987] p.l25, p.l87). Ignorance of the technology of currant cultivation (partly justified because of the lack of publications on the subject) also led Lampe & Jackson [ 1982 J to regard the conversion of arable land into currant vineyards as a re:at~vely easy venture which could be afforded by the peasantry: "Urged on by the excensive Greek commercial network between major European ports, southern peasants p~ancea more and more vineyards in the hopes of supplying European wineries with grapes if not the finished product. The greatest expansion took place during the 1870s, at the time that the Mediterranean phylloxera epidemic struck, even reaching the fledging vineyards in southern Serbia. Inexplicably, Greece was left untouched. When French cultivation recovered by the early 1890s, the numerous Greek vineyards expanded the drying of their grapes into raisins isicJ. The process posed no technological problems, took only ten to twelve days, and required skilled labor but no machinery" (p.l78).

a quite different matter.
Conversion to commodity production is a family decision
which may depend on short and middle term expectations
regarding the profitability of market relations. But as long
as the family keeps working together, the way back to autarky
always remains open as a last resort. By contrast, a decision
of the family head to do without his sons and to rely on the
work of servants and wage-labourers, or a decision of the
sons to leave the paternal household and hire out their
labour for a wage, requires considerations of a much more
general order and of a much longer term.
In an article of 1978, F. Mendels suggested that when the
remuneration of labour is lower than its average
productivity, it is profitable for the head of the family to
substitute servants, or day labourers, for family work. 20 His
conclusion arises from the assumption that the profits of the
farm are equally divided between the members of the family,
and therefore that the exclusion from the farm of some of
them would increase the benefits of those who remain. The
additional labour required to replace those who left, would
cost less, because of relatively low wages ruling on the

However, I suggest that its problematic may also crove useful for the study of quite different societies, provided of course that it. is not mechanically applied.

market. 21 Conversely, when wages are higher than labour
productivity, the family head is expected to face
considerable difficulties in trying to convince his children
to stay on the farm. 22
Mendels recognized however that quite often, even though
substitution of hired labour for children might be more
convenient,

Developing on the considerations presented above, we might
suggest a further, "economic", factor, in addition to the
moral and ideological ones proposed by Mendels: even though,
in the short run, the substitution of wage labour for
children might appear profitable to the head of the family,
or high wages might on the other hand exert a strong
attraction on younger members of the farm, modes of economic
development based on wage labour might nevertheless not yet
have convinced the peasantry of their solidity and long-term
reliability. 24
The predictions of Mendels' model, in cases where,
although the farm was profitable, the family head decided to
keep the children with him, is particularly relevant to our
case study. If the family continued to increase in size, per
"ibidem, p. 786.
"This suggestion is by no means contradictory with the empirica_:_ index of ''distance from a pole of economic development" used by Mendels for measuring the influence of the "traditional morality" factor in his rr.ultiple regressio s: ibidem, p.792.

capita income would after a certain point start to fall.
Therefore,
"A long terme, les paysans adoptaient alors certains
remedes. Ils tentaient d' augmenter la taille de leurs
fermes en achetant ou en louant de la terre Ils
pouvaient adopter de nouvelles cultures qui, en
repartissant l'intensite du travail au cours de l'annee
de fa<;on plus uniforme, pouvaient augmenter la
productivite du travail, sinon par heure, du moins par
personne" (emphasis added) . 25
Although neither of the versions of Mendels's model
presented above may fit Peloponnesian agriculture exactly,
his considerations touch on very significant aspects of the
currant economy. As noted in chapter V, wages in the
Peloponnese were high; so was the profitability of the
peasant farm. Any suggestion as to which was higher would be
no more than a guess, based on assumptions about cyclical
variations of farm profitability and of wages which cannot be
checked with the empirical data available. ·
It may however be suggested that neither the temptation
of young adults to abandon the farm in order to seek wage

employment, nor that of the head of the family to expel some
of his offspring would be unfounded from an economic point of
view. Wages were high, employment abundant, and young people
- especially ~ales - would not encounter great difficulties
if they decided to settle on their own and enjoy freedom
from family hierarchy and obligations. On the other hand,
family heads, even if it would be difficult and costly to
replace the labour of departing children with that of hired
labourers, might continue to farm the same area of vineyard
and employ their additional revenue in money-lending
operations, which were highly profitable in the context of an
expanding economy.
Why neither of these tendencies developed, not even in
part, is probably among other factors due to the
unpredictability of the long term evolution of the currant
sector - a factor which falls under the heading of "economic"
motivations for keeping the family farm intact. 26 As stated
in several parts of this thesis, the currant trade was often
struck by cyclical crises, and more than once no recovery was
in sight. The speculative practices of merchants were
particularly effective in reinforcing this feeling of
uncertainty.

e. Dowry as a regulating mechanism leading to accumulation.
At the same time, a mechanism of adjustment between the
number of wo~king members of the family and farm size was
badly necessary in order to keep the peasant farm from
becoming "too crowded" or "too small" to provide for an
adequate level of living of its members; since in any case,
if the average labour productivity in the farm fell, the
temptation of young males to abandon it would become
stronger, as their remuneration would have fallen
considerably lower than wages prevailing on the market.
The need to adapt resources to population is of course
common to all human societies and is critical for their
reproduction. What varies considerably from a society to
another and across history are the specific solutions given
to this question, and the degree to which they are successful
and capable of ensuring the reproduction of the social
structure specific to each period and to each country.
19th century Greece was typically a society of
smallholders. Therefore, the equilibrium was sought after
mainly at the level of the peasant family. As will be argued
in the following paragraphs, the principal mechanism of
adjustment between population and resources was provided in
the Greek case by the dowry, a traditional institution deeply

266
rooted in the customs of Greek families. Such a mechanism
should not, however, be considered as ensuring adjustment
between men and resources only within a given family during
its life-cycle, but rather as operating across generations
and at the level of the peasant community as a whole.
f. The main characteristics of the institution of the dowry.
The main characteristics of the dowry which emerge from
the study of Psihogios in the Mortgage Hall of Lehena are
very similar to those recorded by sociologists,
anthropologists and ethnographers in case studies referring
to other Greek regions: the dowry was probably the strongest
and most widespread institution of Greek communities. One is
therefore justified in completing the information supplied by
Psihogios with that provided by authors who have studied the
institution of the dowry in other parts of Greece. 27
"On the research conducted by Psihogios on the dowry in Lehena, see n.ll above. The other references on the topic of the dowry used in this chapter are the following: E. Friedl [1962], "Some aspects of dowry and inheritance in Boeotia" in J. Pitt-Rivers [1963] (by far the most relevant and helpful to our purpose), "Kinship, class and selective migration" in J. G. Peristiany :1976 J; J. K. Campbell [1964], "The kindred in a Greek mountain community"; M. Courouc:i, "Dot et Societe en Grece moderne" in Ravis-Giordani [1987]; J. Lampiri-Si:naki "Dowry in Modern Greece: An Institution at the Crossroads Between Persistence and Decline" in M. Kaplan [1985]; P. S. Allen "Internal Migration and the Char-.ging Dowry in Modern Greece" in Koumoulides (ed) [1980], pp.255-284.

(1) The provision of the dowry as an imperative and ~egally
established obligation of the bride's father.
According to the Civil Code of 1945, which followed the
principles of earlier Byzantine-Roman law and applied until
very recently in Greece "the father is obliged to provide his
daughter who is about to get married with a dowry
proportionate to his wealth, to the number of his children,
to his social position, as well as to the social position of
the future husband". Dowry is the property "given to the
husband in order to alleviate the burdens of marriage". 28
But law appears to have done no more than crystallize what
was a norm deeply embedded in the people's minds and in
social relations. E. Friedl observed that in Vasilika,
"The villagers feel a particular obligation to marry off
their daughters. It is among the most import ant of
parental obligations, and one frequently discussed by the
entire elementary family . .. " 29
28 The translation is by Lampiri-Dimaki, op.cit, pp.l66-167.
20Friedl, "Dowry and Inheritance ... " p.127. Illustrative of the st.rong mora: obligation felt by fathers towards the endowment of their daughters is also the case of Aristeidis Harvalos, one of the richest merchants in Amalias. The financial position of Harvalos, so enviable until the end of the 1870s, subsequently deteriorated in a spectacular way. Among other things, in September 1887, 30 stremmata of currant vineyard from his property, as well as his shares of a big water-mill, were sold in auction, following judicial seizure by creditors from Patras against a debt amounting to 16,120 drachmas (TR 34/12620/9/1887). But financial hardship did not hamper him from marrying his daughter Eugenia to another merchant in Amalias, to whom he offered a dowry valued at (continued ... )

268
As confirmed by J. Lampiri-Dimaki, in the 1970s, the majority
of the Greek farmers, working and lower-middle classes still
continued to regulate property relations between parents and
daughters and between husband and wife on the basis of the
rules which emanated from the institution of the dowry. 30
(2) Composition and inalienability of the dowry.
According to Psihogios, dowries registered at the Mortgage
Hall of Lehena, even those between peasants, included land,
currant vineyards, trousseau and cash, of a total value equal
to the living expenses of a family over several years. 31
Currant vineyards, arable land, trousseau, cash, were also
included in all dowry contracts consulted in the archives of
Amalias. 32 Land and cash are reported to have been
indispensable elements of dowries in other Greek agricultural
regions as well; there is no doubt that new couples in Greece
"( ... continued) 16,356 drachmas (TR 30/160-24/12/1887). The value of the dowry was the sa~e as the debt which constrained him to undergo judicial seizure: however, a good dowry was the utmost duty of a family head, and its importance in terms of prestige and alliances was not. comparable to any loss of material property.

"He calculated that dowries between peasants amounted to the subsisc.ence expenses of a family with seven members over four years (op.cit., p.180).
"See eg. cn.6535-10/l/188l, TR 87/30-15/11/1881, TR 33/125-24/711886, TR 31/146-19/9/1886, TR 49/120-29/8/1890, TR 71/149-30/9/1898.

usually got at marriage substantial pieces of property, and
essential means of production in particular. 33
A characteristic which clearly distinguishes the economic
significance of the dowry from that of inheritance is that
the means of production which constituted the dowry are
removed from the bride's family at a moment when the parents
are still active producers, 34 though this dispersal is under
no circumstances counterbalanced by the dowries brought into
the household by the sons' wives. 35 Although in complex
households based on virilocal establishment - as were those
observed by Friedl in Vasilika and as were most probably also
those of currant growers in the Peloponnese36 - revenues from

"" the carrying out of obligations to daughters does result in the dispersal of property owned by the elementary family in the course of the adult life of the parents." (Friedl, op.cit., p.l3l).
35 "Even those fortunate enough to have an equal number of sons and daughters cannot replace what they give in dowries by what the boys bring in from their wives. Certainly, if the son lives in town, income from his wife's dowry does not contribute directly to the standard of living of his parents back in the village. When a son stays on the farm, the revenue from his ;vife' s dower properties may replace the loss of income from the property given with a daughter's dowry, but the advent of grandchildren soon adds to the household's expenses and there is, in the long run, a net loss" (ibidem, p.l31).
"During research in Amalias, it proved impossible to discover any source on residence patterns; as a result, the present thesis is unable to bring any substantial contribution to the discussion on the prevalent type of household. The only relevant fragments of evidence are: a) a contract indicating that the husband of a rich politician's daughter and his wife were living together with his father-in-law (TR 33/125-24/7/1886); b) an inter-vivos transmission of property from a retiring father to a son, under condition that tne son wou:c live together and take care of the old man (TR 13/29-8/9/1873); c) an agreer:1ent between two married brothers who decided to live togetner ana snare tneir properties in common. On the other hand, information from contracts of pianting and share-cropping agreements indicate that brothers or cousins freq;_;ent2.y collaborated in agricultural tasks, and the findings on the common boundaries of members of the same patrilineal kin presented in chapter II point in the same direction. I think, however, that the thesis of Psihogios on the prevalence of complex (continued ... )

dower property were not set apart from the overall income of
the family, they were to a great extent used for the
upbringing of the children of the new couple.
On the other hand, neither the estate nor the monetary
part of the dowry could ever be sold or otherwise alienated
by the groom's family. 37 Not even the groom himself could
dispose of the dowry as he wished, without the consent of his
wife. 38 As a result, the dowry brought in by a son might never
be used to endow any of his unmarried sisters. 39 It ensues
that a dowry, apart from being a transfer of property between
different lineages, is principally one between succeeding
generations. 40
" ( ... continued) household patterns (see p.251, above) is the most valid suggestion from those available, and I agree with him that the conclusions of Panagiotopoulos :1984: on the prevalence of nuclear households are unfounded. This latter view is shared by an increasing number of Greek historians (see eg. Petmezas [1990] p.30, n.39).
37 " ••• the income from the young wife·' s dower property is likely to be pooled with that of the paternal holdings ..• Under no circumstances is it considered proper to sell dower lands to supply money for ordinary living expenses. Nor should the dowry monies be used for such purposes. In whatever form, the dowry is considered capital which may be invested or saved to add to the estate available for the newly married couple's children ... After the death of the groom's father, the farming sons divide the patrimony ... Once the division of the property has taken place, each brother is free to exploit, in his own way, an estate derived .•• from two sources; from the patrimony that fell to his lot at the division, and from his wife's dowry, wi.th any accrued increase ... " (Friedl, op.cit., p.l25).
38The wife's father and her brothers had also the right to be consuJ.tec: aboc;t the management of her dowry: see ibidem, p.l27.
39Psihogios' s conclusions are similar (op.cit, p.l50), although he interprets the effects of the inalienability of the dowry in a quite different manner. See also Couroucli, op.cit., p.328.

(3} Order and age at marriage.
Any possibility of dowries circulating between members of
the same generation was also precluded by the imperative
obligation of male children to remain single until all their
sisters got married. 41 This restriction, probably the most
significant of all the dower rules, achieved several
objectives at one stroke.
The most immediate one was that as long as a son remained
single, he contributed to the formation of his sisters'
dowries. The postponement of the son's marriage extended the
period during which the producer I consumer ratio in the
household was favourable to saving. Because as soon as a new
bride was brought in, children would follow, and this
favourable ratio would be overturned. The income from the
dower property would be added to that of the family; but
since it could not be alienated, it is doubtful whether it
might contribute at all to the accumulation of extra
property. 42

"Psihogios op.cit. p.lS0-152 maintains that the combinatior o: patrilocal establishment with delayea marriage of sons was an impediment to marr~age. :r order to prove his cor.cl~sion, he examines first the case of a fami:y where the eldest child is female, and suggests that the easiest in that case wo·Jld be either to bring in a groom for the daughter or to marry a son before marry~r.g the daughter, and so attract an additional worker, either the groom or the bride (plus dower property in the second case).

272
On the other hand, brothers had an explicit moral
obligation to contribute to the formation of their sisters'
dowries, or even, should the father die or be unable to work,
to assume on their own the responsibility for their
marriage. 43 Moreover, according to Friedl, it was in the
brother's interest that his sister married well, because in
that way the prestige of the whole family increased, and as
a result he was able in his turn to marry a girl with a
substantial dowry. 44 By contrast, unmarried sisters were a
serious disadvantage on the marriage market, because the
family of the future bride would fear that the groom might
spend a considerable portion of his property in dowries. 45
At the same time, female priority at marriage attached
sons to the paternal household and encouraged them to remain
loyal to their father even beyond marriage. It should be
noted here that the person responsible for a young male
42 ( ••• continued) it is clear that he omits the impact of the birth of additional children. On the other hand, any attempt to prove that marriage customs in Greece rendered marriage difficult, should also explain why marriage was practically universal and the rate of definitive celibacy was so low. Serelea [1978] p.SO, who analyzed the data offered by the census of population of 1879, found that definitive female celibacy was 3. 3%, the lowest recorded for Western and Mediterranean Europe.
"On thi"s point, see Friedl [1962] p.66 and "Dowry and inheritar,ce. p.l32, Campbell [196~] p.44, Larnpiri-Dimaki op.cit. p.l73, Courouc:: op.o c. p.332.

adult's marriage and for the dowry his wife was going to
receive from her family was the father, not the young man
himself. 46 If a son could marry and receive a dowry before his
sisters, he might decide to settle on his own and evade his
obligations towards the family, even at the cost of being
disinherited. But if he was obliged to contribute first to
the formation of dowries, it was in his interest to continue
to stay in the household after his marriage and work together
with his father until the latter's retirement or death, so as
to benefit from a fair part of the inheritance. 47
Linked to the established order of male and female
children at marriage was also the question of the age at
marriage considered desirable for each sex. Generally
speaking, it appears that a woman expected to marry between
20 and 25, though her husband should not be younger than 25
and not much older than 30. 48 The belief that men should marry
later than women was well suited to the rule of the priority
of sisters at marriage; in particular, it rendered long years
of work for the sisters' dowries more acceptable for sons.

(4) Dowry as surplus and as saving.
As suggested above, the resources which make up part of
a dowry were .taken away from the household and irrevocably
devolved to subsequent generations at a moment when parents
were still fully active, though dowries brought in the
household by sons could not be considered as integral parts
of the paternal property. As a result, resources destined to
become dowries should be in excess of the requirements of
those remaining in the bride's parental household, both in
terms of revenue and in terms of working capital. 49 In that
sense, dower resources constituted a surplus, over and above
•
subsistence needs.
The surplus character of the dowry is clearly illustrated
when compared to inheritance. Inheritance cannot be a priori
considered to be a surplus: a man may very well accumulate
•
wealth in order to fulfil his (socially determined)
obligations towards his children during life. But although
the equitable and efficient disposal of property at death is
always an important concern, there are no accounts of any
widespread moral obligation upon anybody to produce something
in excess of his ~eeds in order to bequeath it at death. By
contrast, dowry formation automatically involves
"See Psihogios, op.cit. p.l67.

275
accumulation.
A related question is that concerning the size of the
dowry. According to sanctioned custom, it should be
proportional to the family property. However, there are
several reports on "dowry inflation" in various periods and
places. 50 As reported above, Psihogios found that the value
of dowries in Lehena had a tendency to increase throughout
the second half of the 19th century. 51 Friedl observed a
similar phenomenon in Vasilika. She considered it a sequel of
the pursuit of hypergamy, which in that case was connected
with urban occupation and residence:
" the dowry comes into the consciousness of the
villagers more often as a property requirement for
marrying off their daughters than as a means of
transmitting the inheritance. When, in addition, the high
value placed on social mobility is translated into an
effort to find urban sons-in-law for one's daughters, the
dowry emerges as a mechanism for increasing the social
prestige of the family. Farmers are willing to give more
material property in exchange for the greater satisfaction
50Besides the examples by Psihogios and Friedl reported below, see also Lampiri-Dimaki op.cit. pp.l75-176 and Couroucli op.cit. p.340 and Allen, op.cit; a short oral intervention by J. Peristiany on increasing dowries in Cyprus is reported in Ravis-Giordani [l987; p.40l.
51 See p.252, above.

276
to be derived from arranging a hypergamous union for a
daughter. " 52
Since this tendency was universal, and since the "supply" of
grooms was by definition inelastic, continuously increasing
dowries were required to get the same type of husband.
"Such inflation has had several consequences. The value
of dowries is no longer necessarily limited to the share
of the inheritance to which the daughter is entitled.
Farming sons are willing to give up some portion of their
shares to add to the prestige and influence of the
family . .. " 53
Did the pursuit of hypergamy account for dowry inflation
in 19th century Lehena as well? Very probably, but it is not

277
possible to find positive confirmation for this assumption. 54
In any case, this recurrent phenomenon clearly illustrates
the vigour of the dowry as an institution, which in 1985
Cyprus was still strong enough to compel parents "to spend a
whole life in order to constitute a dowry". 55
In manifest contrast with what is supposed to be the
typical behaviour of producers in peasant societies, 56 Greek
families seeking to provide dowries for their daughters seem
to have striven strongly for accumulation of property above
their subsistence needs, either by trying to fully exploit
their productive capacity or by compressing their levels of
' 57
consumptlon.
The institution of the dowry imposed hard work not only
on prospective brides, but on both males and females during
"At that date, much before the start of rural exodus from the Greek countryside, the search for urban sons-in-law was of course restricted only to elite families (see Psihogios op.cit. p.182; a few similar examples for Amalias are mentioned in chapter II, above). For peasant families living in currant growing villages, hypergamy would have probably consisted of finding a groom from a family who possessed a substantial vineyard. During my research visits in Amalias, I was told that until World War II, the owner of a currant vineyard large enough to fully employ the members of a family had high chances on the local "marriage market" and was considered a groom more desirable than a lowlevel civil servant. In fact, as late as the 1960s, Friedl observed a quite similar rank order in Vasilika: farmers who possessed sufficient land to avoid wage labour or share-cropping were ranked at the same level with prospect~ve sons-in-law employed in middle-level civil service or equivalent post, higher than a low-level civil servant (see Friedl "Kinship, class and selec::.ive migration", p.365).

most of the productive period of their life. A single adult
male was obliged to produce above what was required for
subsistence in order to contribute to the formation of his
sisters' dowries; a single adult female was obliged to work
for her own dowry; and both married men and women alike
should work to create the dowries of their daughters. 58
"This strong imperative to accumulate could not fail to deeply influence the way of life and the values of Greek villagers. Let me quote the lively and beautiful evocation by Friedl:" ... another component of the concatenation of values among the people of Vasilika is a feeling that whether or not the eventual advancement of the family is a realistic possibility, it is necessary to be continually energetic- really to exert one's vitality- in an effort to improve the family's economic and social position. The farmers believe that satisfaction can be derived from the effort alone, and a hard-working man is admired for his energy regardless of its outcome. Dr. Peristiany has declared that social relations among the Cypriots he studied have the quality of agonia, by which he meant a struggle in which there is intense feeling without personal antagonism. In the same vein, the villagers of Vassilika see life itself a struggle. "Palevoume - we are wrestling", they say. An outsider can abstract from much ordinary behavior in Vasilika the further generalization that unless a man participates in that struggle he is not considered fully masculine. He is not a whole man. Life in the community seems charged with tension, with a nervous vitality, partly caused, I believe, by the fear that circumstances may drive men to abandon the perpetual wrestling-match with life . The tempelis, the loafer who drinks too much, or sits in the coffee house all day and squanders his income in the process, constitutes a problem for some families, and also exemplifies a culturally recognized form of personal maladjustment. Both the villagers wno have tendencies in that direction, and the generalized concept of the idler, are subjects for jesting in the village. The high frequency with which laziness is joked about and the quality of the laughter evoked may perhaps be understood best as an expression of a particular kind of ambivalence. On the one hand, the villagers are strongly tempted to abandon the combat, to retreat to irresponsibility, for it is only in that way that they can achieve a semblance of peace. On the other hand, to succumb to such a temptation would mean the loss of all vital masculine force. They both envy and hate the lazy drunkara and, therefore, they laugh at him, albeit uneasily" ("Dowry and Inheritance p. 118) .

g. The dowry and its role in social reproduction.
(1) Some tentative comparisons.
i) Greek dowry and English "portion".
A. Macfarlane, in his account of the English marriage
pattern in the period from 1300 to 1840, notes that "unlike
the dowries of many Mediterranean societies", in England "the
girl was not expected to provide a house, nor did she usually
bring tools or livestock", though "land was an optional
extra". 59 In fact, there seem to have been significant
quantitative differences between the "portion" to be brought
by the girl in England and the Mediterranean dowry.
According to Macfarlane, the "portion" of a girl in the
lower half of the population was of the order of money and
goods worth between £10 and £30. 60 Since the average yearly
wage of a female servant was about £10, this sum corresponded
to one to three years' wages and could relatively easily be
saved by a girl during a reasonable period of time before
marriage, even without help from her parents. This resulted
in a relatively weak parental control over marriage; as the

280
author puts it, "an active labour market provided an
alternative to inherited wealth". 61 On the other hand, if the
Mediterranean dowry constituted the main "brake" on
marriages, in England this brake was mainly the "pervasive
social rule that a man should not marry until he was able to
earn an independent 'living' sufficient to maintain his
family at a reasonable standard". 62 In its turn, the capacity
to earn a decent "living" depended mainly on the acquisition
of a skill, permitting a reasonably favourable assimilation
of the individual within an economy characterized by an
advanced division of labour.
Psihogios calculated that the average value of the peasant
dowry at Lehena amounted to 2,209 drachmas in 1857-1879,
2,520 drachmas in 1880-1892 and 3,142 drachmas in 1900-1905. 63
The smallest dowry I encountered in Amalias, offered by a
doctor to his female servant, amounted to 1,000 drachmas. 64
These sums were much more substantial than those recorded for
England. First, they corresponded to more than three years'

wages, not only of female, but also of male servant labour. 65
It should be recalled that Greek wages were notoriously high,
and therefore the possibility that the discrepancy emerging
from this comparison is due to a difference between Greek and
English servants' wages is very reduced. Moreover, as noted
above, the value Df an average peasant dowry corresponded to
the living expenses of a large family over several years. 66
It is evident that the accumulation of the resources
required to form a Greek dowry necessitated the involvement
of the entire household and allowed for a very strong
parental control over marriage. The contrast with the English
case is exemplary: in England, a relatively modest "portion"
and a developed labour market rendered marriage largely an
individual decision, though the expectation that a man should
earn a decent "living" stimulated the formation of a skilled
labour force. In Greece, a large dowry in a context of an
economy based on household production rendered marriage a
collective concern of the family members, imposed strict
parental control over individual decisions and reinforced the
solidity and the productive capacity of the household.

ii) Greek dowry in a South European context.
The impact of transfers of property upon marriage on
social reproduction emerges also in a comparison within South
European peasant societies. 67 Fontelas, the hamlet in North
east Portugal studied by B. J. O'Neill, might be considered
as an extreme limiting case in a South European context,
since it is found in "Atlantic" rather than in
"Mediterranean" Portugal. In Fonte las, the dowry, or any
other form of property transfer upon marriage is completely
absent. Property transfer occurs at the death of the parents,
which implies a very authoritarian relationship between
generations. Absence of dowry and, more in general,
prevalence of patrimony over matrimony is associated with a
"repression of marriage", very high rate of illegitimacy and
preferential inheritance. 68 This combination of kinship
relations - property relations, aiming at maintaining viable
"Dowry is considered to be a typical Mediterranean phenomenon. But as is revealed by anthropological inquiries conducted in a multitude of villages, patterns of transfer of property at marriage vary very widely across the Mediterranean Sea. Unfortunately, these inquiries do not follow any homogeneous methodology and do not use uniform terminology, so that any effort to provide a consistent outline turns out to be very difficult. A comprehensive survey is provided by Davis [1977] pp.lB0-195, who discusses the problems arising from the inaccurate use of terms for property transfers and suggests a ~~iform terminology. I think that an attempt to provide a general scheme for the geographica~ distribution of property transfers at marriage and for their possible associat: n with historical or anthropological parameters might turn out to be very fruit!~ But this is would be a separate endeavour, falling outside tne scope of :. e present study.

landholdings, generated a social structure characterized by
pronounced differentiation and economic inequality. 69
A contrasting example - much closer to Greek experience 
is offered by an article of J. Schneider on Sicilian
trousseaus. Schneider suggests that dedication of Sicilian
women to embroidery during the 19th century aimed at the
creation of exchange value and associates this practice with
"the long-run viability of Sicilian families and their
defense against proletarianization" which "necessitated
possession of mobile wealth as well as productive resources,
so much that the marriage exchange system gave equal weight
to both." 70
What is relevant for our purpose here is the parallel way
in which the dowry seems to have been associated with social
reproduction in both cases: the absence of dowry in Fontelas
is linked to social differentiation and inequality, whereas
in Sicily, its forceful application Js a check to
proletarianization. In the 19th century Peloponnese, where
the dowry was probably still more powerful and universal than
in Sicily, 7: procedures of social differentiation seem to have

standard of the groom's parents to be lowered. As regards
other members of the family, i.e. daughters, they should
normally have already married out.
Moreover, even if the bride had only sisters, it should
not be thought that her family enjoyed no counterpart for the
dowry they have given out. According to Friedl,
"the control of the property establishes social links
between a man and his wife's close parental kindred". 78
"Each elementary family develops a new network of affinal
kin relationships in each generation. These relationships
are maintained for at least some years after a marriage,
and frequently throughout life, partly as a result of the
residual interest a girl's family has in her dower
property. Affinal relatives as well as lineal kin and
close collaterals are considered available as possible
sources of aid and influence for job-getting, for hints
on land opportunities, for suggestions for good marriage
possibilities and the like " 79

(4) Dowry and transatlantic migration.
Most probably, "dowry inflation" in the late 19th-early
20th century was also closely connected with the massive
migration to the USA in 18 93-192 4. 80 Since migration is
usually interpreted as the debacle of the peasantry, the fact
that young males migrated in order to earn the dowry of their
sister (so as to be themselves able to marry afterwards} is
believed to be one of the most evil impacts of the dowry
institution. My suggestion is that the connection between
dowry and migration constitutes rather an illustration of the
role of the dowry in reinforcing the reproduction of the
household and of its values and in avoiding
proletarianization.
First of all, it should be noted that the original cause
for migration was the currant crisis, not the "dowry
inflation"; 81 the latter phenomenon was a sequel of the high
demands of returning migrants. Of course, in its turn, the
pressure over families with unmarried daughters incited them
to send some of their members to the USA in order to collect
the resources needed. 82

292
In addition, it is not clear whether the pattern of Greek
transatlantic migration really disintegrate~~households or
whether it was rather inscribed into a household strategy of
defense against the risk of disintegration. As pointed out by
Kitroef,
"historical work in the last quarter-century has moved
away from the older line of explanation that regarded
migration as an uprooting and a breach in the lives of
those who moved across the Atlantic. Emigration is now
being seen more as a process of collective transformation
in which Old World norms adapted to the new environment,
having been transplanted rather than uprooted. " 83
The findings of Kitroef, following research on original
documents never before used in the study of Greek migration,
are clearly in favour of this view. 84 It is observed that
those who left were not necessarily the poorer peasants, but
rather those who were able to finance the travel costs and

293
whose families could replace their labour in the farm. 85 There
are addition strong indications that the migration of
Greek peasants was not a desperate exodus, but that it was
planned by the family and that it followed a carefully
articulated path: for instance, those who left after the
pioneers were often going to join a relative; also, an
increasing participation of women is recorded for after 1915,
who probably followed the successful establishment of male
members of their households in the new environment. 86
On the other hand, migration is reported to have had
significant positive repercussions on relatives who remained
at home. Remittances of migrants not only assisted them in
redeeming their land from debt, 87 but also caused a
considerable decline in the ruling rates of interest. 88 And
this is a meaningful illustration of ~he positive impact of
family-planned migration on the well-being of the peasantry.
Hence, the association between the institution of the
dowry and migration, instead of being a proof of its
detrimental impact, seems to have been a further indication

efforts to defend the household mode of producti ainst

•
"Following a different approach, that of "modernization theory", l..ampi:ciDimaki (op.cit. p.l72) reaches a similar conclusion: "It is of interest to note that, ironically enough, it is the existence of a traditional institution - that of the dowry - which encourages female emancipation, for it is very often in order to meet the demands made by tradition that Greek women have to follow a nontraditional way of living, that is, to work outside their own homes either in this country or abroad. At the same time, however, the very fact that such emancipation is used to reinforce traditional norms- i.e., the wages earned are used to form a dowry - leads to a more rapid acceptance of social change than would have been the case in the opposite instance."

Conclusion.
Rather than recapitulate the main arguments of the thesis
- which, I hope, are exposed in the respective chapters in a
sufficiently clear manner - let me here attempt to put the
most important of them in a more general, comparative and
theoretical perspective.
The thesis aims principally at studying peasant
agriculture and peasant family strategies. But these can not
be examined in isolation from trade and the strategies of
merchant capital. This combined approach is first of all
imposed by the geographical and temporal context: the 19th
century experienced an unprecedented development of
international trade; moreover, the Mediterranean is a
geographical area which has since very old times been
characterized by intense exchange and deep penetration of
market relations.
The predominance of merchant capitalism over the Greek
ecor.omy in particular seems to have been exceptionally
strong. As is pointed out by G. Dertilis,
"Il s'agit d' une economie dominee, pendant pres de
deux siecles (XVIIIe-XXe), par un ensemble de reseaux
financiers, operant sur trois niveaux hierarchses et
distincts, qui correspondent aux horizons geographiques

298
established in the exporting cities and ports, who were in
direct contact with the foreign markets of consumption.
On the other hand, the relevance of merchant strategies
for the development of currant viticulture is also
illustrated by their negative impact. As was shown in several
parts of the thesis, the overwhelming domination of merchants
over the currant sector imposed on it very restrictive
conditions: in particular, merchants altogether avoided
granting long-term loans to the growers and discounting
commercial risks. These practices seriously limited the
benefits which might have accrued to the Greek economy from
the currant sector.
Of course, the negative association between merchant
ascendancy over the economy and development is not peculiar
to Greece. To quote here K. Marx:
" wherever merchant's capital still predominates we
find backward conditions. This is true even within one and
the same country, in which, for instance, the specifically
merchant towns present far more striking analogies with
past conditions than industrial towns.
The independent and predominant development of
capital as merchant's capital is tantamount to the non
subjection of production to capital, and hence to capital

299
developing on the basis of an alien social mode of
production which is also independent of it. The
independent development of merchant's capital, therefore,
stands in inverse proportion to the general economic
development of society. " 4
However, the "non-subjection of production to capital",
a condition which is perfectly valid for the case of peasant
agriculture, does not necessarily imply independence of
peasant producers from capital. As argued by M. Aymard,
peasants always found themselves obliged to pass through
several distinct markets in order to secure subsistence: the
market of agricultural products, the land market, the money
market and the labour market. 5 These markets were often
conditioned to a large degree by merchant capital.
Rather than with independence of peasant producers, the
"non-subjection of production to capital" was in several
cases connected with an aversion of merchants to undertake
organization of production and its risks, as long as their
commercial activities offered them high and relatively secure
profits. Of course, under these circumstances, the
traditional role of the peasant family as a producer was

reproduced without contestation.
Currant viticulture is a typical instance of this.
Although production was entirely commercialized, although it
was developed with credit of merchant origin, the prevalent
unit of production always remained the peasant family, even
on the big farms of non-peasant ownership.
Thus, the ambiguous attitude of Greek merchant capital
towards production does not seem to have been exceptional. In
contrast, the attitude of the Greek peasantry was certainly
not typical. As shown by the prevalent type of anticipated
sales of fruit, of planting and of share-cropping agreements,
peasant growers undertook most of the risk involved in the
creation of currant vineyards, in yearly cultivation and in
the commercialization of the crop. As was argued, this was
connected with an income-maximizing attitude of the
peasantry. This attitude offered to the currant sector a
badly needed flexibility and was the main factor of its rapid
expansion: if it was not for the "nervous vitality"
characterizing Greek peasant communities, 6 it is difficult to
understand how currant viticulture could ever have expanded
at such impressive rates, under the unfavourable conditions
which ruled in the credit and labour markets. The peasant
family was eager to provide dowries for its daughters - and
'See E. Friedl, quoted above in n.58, p.278, chapter VI.

301
in general, to endow the younger generation with resources
sufficient to maintain and improve the productivity of labour
in the family farm and to guarantee the reproduction of the
material and spiritual conditions of peasant life. And it was
the only social entity which possessed a reserve of labour,
skill and forbearance adequate to face the difficulties of
recurrent crises, destructions of the crop by bad weather or
disease, lack of any insurance for the prices of the next
season.
At the same time, the speculative practices of the
merchants, aiming at quick profits with low risk, do not seem
to have been very efficient in absorbing the entire surplus
produced by the currant economy. Peasant farms, able to
endure crises - even at the cost of falling heavily into debt
- could obtain substantial benefits in years of strong demand
and rising prices, and compete successfully with larger farms
using hired labour.
On the other hand, the prevalence of small farms, lacking
adequate resources, perpetuated their dependency on the
merchant capital. Moreover, the readiness of the peasantry to
assume production under conditions which could not be
tolerated by bigger farms allowed the merchants to expand
their activities without effecting any change in their
practices.
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


302
A peculiar compatibility appears therefore to have existed
between the domination of the merchants over the sphere of
circulation (and over the economy in general) and the
prevalence of peasant family farms in the production of
currants. This combination of course limited any possibility
of development of capitalist agriculture. The capacity of the
peasant family to maintain the productivity of its labour at
competitive levels within the family farm checked almost
completely the development of the labour market. In turn,
scarcity of wage labourers consolidated the competitive
position of the family farm.
In order to better understand and define this "strange
compatibility", it may be helpful to compare it with the two
opposite, more widespread and much more theorized situations
of subsistence agriculture and of capitalist agriculture. In
subsistence agriculture, such as that studied by Chayanov, 7
to which Aymard mainly refers, 8 and which might be perfectly
outlined by the second version of F. Mendels's model
mentioned above, 9 the typical producer is the peasant
household, oriented towards autarky. The relations of the
peasants with the markets are negative. As producers, they

303
produce in excess of their needs only if compelled to do so
because of "external" pressure. When the prices of their
crops increase, they tend to sell less, since less is
sufficient to provide for their fixed monetary needs.
Similarly, peasants hire out their labour only in order to
complete their inadequate revenue from the family farm. If
wages increase, they rather tend to work less outside the
farm, since less days' wages are enough to provide what is
needed. In terms of economic theory, elasticities of both
product supply and labour supply are negative to price.
Capitalist agriculture is the extreme opposite. Capitalist
producers and labourers are not the same physical persons, as
is the case in peasant agriculture. The typical unit of
production is no longer the family farm producing for
subsistence, but the enterprise, producing for profit.
Elasticities of product supply and labour supply are
positive: capitalist farms are ready to produce more when
prices are higher, whereas workers whose revenues depend
mainly on the labour market will work more if wages are
higher.
The case of currant viticulture does net correspond to
either of these models, but has characteristics in common
with both. There is no doubt that currant growers reacted
positively to the incitations of the market: the more
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486


304
currants they were able to sell, the more they produced. The
curve of product supply was positive, as in capitalist
agriculture. However, since the main productive unit remained
the family farm, and since peasants preferred working on the
farm rather than seeking wages elsewhere, the supply of
labour reacted in a negative way to wages and was similar to
that in subsistence agriculture.
Essential to the coherence of this model is the assumption
that peasant families do not a priori reject the acquisition
of use-values through exchange with commodities, and that
their negative attitude towards markets in the case of
subsistence agriculture is due to the hierarchical and
monopolistic structures of the latter, which usually impose
very unfavourable terms to direct producers and deprive them
from any benefit from participation in market relations . 10
According to this assumption, if the peasant families are
allowed to benefit from market relations, they do not
hesitate to participate in them and try to accumulate.
On the other hand, voluntary peasant participation in
market relations does not include the labour market. The
reasons for the insistence of peasants· on the family
organization of production are discussed in chapter VI. 11 As

305
argued, this insistence may be put down to economic as well
as to ideological factors. But what appears to be critical
for the coherence of the family unit is the level of labour
productivity in the family farm in comparison with the level
of wages. In particular, if labour in the family farm is
considerably less productive than wages offered on the labour
market, male children will be strongly tempted to abandon it.
Thus, accumulation of productive resources sufficient to
maintain a competitive level of labour productivity in the
family farm becomes an imperative for the reproduction of
peasant productive units.
What I consider to be particularly interesting in the type
of peasant agriculture discussed here is its intrinsic
tendency to reproduce itself, as long as powerful external
changes do not intervene. Specialization and production for
the market increases the productivity of family labour. This
renders the resort to the labour market less necessary and
less desirable for the members of the family. In turn, the
underdevelopment of the labour market renders more difficult
the development of non-peasant enterprises, and thus
consolidates the relative position of the family productive
unit.
On the other hand, the ability of the peasant family to
keep its productivity at competitive levels, and therefore

maintain its coherence, may be seriously reduced if
accumulated capital is massively invested in the economy, as
occurs in many countries in the industrial era. In that case,
in several sectors, non-peasant enterprises become
incomparably more productive and peasant families lose any
chance of competition with them for the allocation of the
labour force of the younger generations.
Conversely, as long as accumulated capital avoids
undertaking the organization of production, the prevalence of
family productive units is reproduced. And as noted above,
when the dominant form of accumulated wealth is merchant
capital, it often tends to abstain from productive
investment. Developing on these considerations, there might
be an intrinsic association between merchant capital
ascendancy over the economy and family organization of
production.
Let me conclude with a suggestion for further research:
if the considerations presented above turn out to be valid,
they might be particularly relevant to the study of
Mediterranean societies. In fact, trade in the Mediterranean
has been very important since a very early date, and
merchants have been exceptionally powerful. At the same time,
the Mediterranean is often considered as an area with a very
strong family tradition, particularly in the economic

sphere. 12 It might prove we :...-th-while to investigate the
possible relationship between the two phenomena.

Appendix I. Interest rates and risks.
A contract of anticipated purchase of currant fruit like
those described above may be considered as a bond; the
creditor advances to the debtor the sum A, which in the
absence of usury should be equal to the estimated value of
the bond at the moment of issue (~,) .
( 1}
The estimated value of the bond at the moment of issue
depends on the future nominal value of the bond at the moment
of discharge (YeJ ,the general rate of discount ruling on the
market (i) and the estimated probability of default (p) :
Yta = [ Yte * ( 1 - P ) ] / ( 1 + i ) t ( 2 )
The nominal value of the bond at the moment of discharge will
be equal to:
Ye. = A * ( 1 + r ) e ( 3)
where A is the sum originally advanced, r is the rate of
interest per unit of time recorded on the contract and t is

310
the duration of the loan. By substituting Yt. in (2) according
to (3) we arrive at the equation:
Yet = [ A * ( 1 + r ) t * ( 1 - p ) 1 I ( 1 + i ) e
But if condition (1) is true, (4) may be written as follows:
Yt. = A = [ A * ( 1 + r ) e * ( 1 - p ) 1 I ( 1 + i ) t ( 5 )
and therefore:
( 1 + r )t = ( 1 + i )e I ( 1 - p ) ( 6)
That is, in the absence of usury, or, in other words, if the
credit market was working as a perfect competitive market,
the rate of interest applied to any loan should only depend
on the general rate of discount ruling on the market and on
the risk of non-repayment of the loan.
If village merchants and currant growers were borrowing
in a unified market, then the value of i would be universal
and the difference in the rate of interest on merchants' and
growers' loans would be justifiable only by the difference in

the respective probabilities of non-repayment of the loans.
In the case of loans to merchants, function (6) should be:
( 1 + r. Jt = ( 1 + i Jt I ( 1 - p. J (7 l
where r. is the rate of interest of loans accorded to
merchants and p. is the average probability of non-fulfilment
of the obligation; and respectively in the case of loans to
currant growers, function (6) should be:
( 1 + r 9 Jt = ( 1 + i Je I ( 1 - p 9 J ( 8)
For the sake of simplicity, let us admit that in both cases
t = 1, i.e. that the duration of loans is equal to the unit
of time to which rand i are expressed. Therefore:
( 1 + r,. ) * ( 1 - p,. ) = ( 1 + r 9 ) * ( 1 - p 9 ) ( 9)
and:
( 1 + r!" J I ( 1 + r 9 J = ( 1 - p 9 J I ( 1 - p,. J ( 1 o)
If we assume that the rates of interest recorded on the
contracts studied in Amalias are representative - in fact, a
wide range of sources confirm this assumption - then the rate
that forms the left side of the equation (10) may be given a
Franghiadis, Alexis (1990), Peasant agriculture and export trade :currant viticulture in Southern Greece,1830-1893 European University Institute DOI: 10.2870/10486

numeric value. If 12% was the regular rate of interest on the
advances to village merchants and 24% the rate of interest on
the advances to currant growers, then:
( 1 - p 11 ) I ( 1 - p. ) = 1.12 I 1. 24 ( 11)
where we arrive at the equation:
p 11 = 0. 0967741 + ( 0. 9032258 * P. ) (12)
Equation (12) expresses the relationship between average risk
of non-repayment of merchant debts and average risk of
non-repayments of peasant debts that would justify rates of
interest of 12% and 24% respectively, on loans contracted on
a unified market.
However, the level of average risk accepted by creditors
is by no means unlimited: nobody lends money if he believes
that such an operation is so risky that there is no hope of
realizing any profit and that the probability of suffering
losses is high. In a given productive environment, creditors
would stop issuing loans at a given interest rate r if they
realized that 1 - p was too low to guarantee the "just"
recompense of their capital, represented by i. The expected
future value of the issued bonds may not be smaller than the

value of the advanced capital, increased by i:
A* (l+r) * (l+p) A*(l+i) (13)
and therefore:
p (r-i)/(l+r) (14)
If i were equal to 8%J the general rate of discount practised
by the National Bank of Greece, acting as central bank of the
country, then p. could not be higher than 0.036 and pg would
be rather lower than 0.129.
Let us assume that the average risk accepted for loans to
merchants at 12% interest was 0.03 (in other words, that the
creditors expected that 3% of the loans to merchants were not
going to be reimbursed) . If the equation (12) were true, the
respective average risk of loans to peasants at 24% interest
should have been 0.124, i.e. creditors should have granted
loans to peasants up to the point of expecting that 12.4% of
these loans were never going to be reimbursed. That is, only
an average risk of loans to peasants 4.13 t~mes higher than
the average risk of loans to merchants would confirm the
validity of equation (12).
An analysis exactly equivalent to the above is presented
