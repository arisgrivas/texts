Lecture 1:

It's.

Not.

How high is the water, mama?

Two feet high and rise.

How has the water, Papa?

She said it's two feet high and rising.

But we can make it to the road in a

homemade boat, because that's the only thing.

We got left to the float.

It's already over all of wheat and those two feet

high and rising.

How has the water, mama?

Three feet high and rising.

How has the water, Papa?

You said it's three feet high and rising.

Well, the hives are gone.

I lost my bees chicken for sleeping in the will

of trees, towels and water.

Up past her knees, three feet high and rising in

height.

Oh, I saw.

What Mama Horthy heard.

Right.

How has the water, Papa?

She said it's four feet high and rising.

Hey, come look through the window pane.

The bus is coming and going to take us to

the train.

Looks like to be blessed with a little more rain.

Or behind rises in the.

Past the water.

Mama had cried.

How has the water?

Papa said its five high rises.

Well, the rails are washed out north of town.

We gotta head for higher ground.

We can't come back till the water goes down.

Five feet high and rising.

Well, it's five feet high and rising.

Not that I know of that.

I'm glad you know.

Okay.

How do you know my friends?

Uh.

Um.

My boss just.

Put it like.

This.

It looks horrible.

Yeah, I just think it's great.

Yeah.

So good.

Um.

All right, let's get started.

Realise this room is, uh, a little bit difficult to

find.

Don't know if, uh, anybody got hungry on their way

in, having to walk through the cafeteria.

Um, it also seems like we're a little bit cramped

for space.

So I will make a subtle inquiry with the powers

that be to see if I can get us into

a different room.

Um, no promises on that, though.

Uh, so everybody's here for 102?

Yes.

I'm in the right place.

You're in the right place.

So, uh, what I'm going to do today, uh, introduce

you to the intellectual motivations of this course.

Uh, and also talk about the boring but necessary, uh,

practical, uh, and administrative measures.

Right.

Um, so this is pre-industrial economic history, right?

The purpose here is to look further in the past

than the 18th or 19th centuries or the Industrial Revolution.

And try to understand what happened before then and why

it's important.

Right.

Can we find, uh, the roots of modern economic growth

or economic divergence and convergence in the more distant past?

Um, that's why we're here.

Uh, I'm Jordan Claridge.

I'm a medieval economic historian.

I'll be doing your lectures all year.

Uh, the classes will be taught by my colleagues, Will

and Greg.

Um, so, uh.

Yeah, as I said, I spent most of my, uh,

time when I'm not here reading things like this.

Medieval Latin manuscripts.

Uh, I just finished a book on the horse trade,

uh, in medieval England.

So, I mean, one of the things that I will

introduce you to.

Uh, that actually explains quite a lot of economic divergence

between Western Europe and Asia.

Is Western Europe's reliance on animal power, right?

So, uh, in terms of understanding technological change, there's a

lot of a, you know, small, cheap, but essential technological

technology here in terms of the horse collar and the

horseshoe, uh, absolutely revolutionised agricultural productivity in medieval England, which

then freed up labour to focus on, uh, manufacturing.

And, you know, the industrial sector that was the industrial,

the engine of growth centuries later.

Um, I also work on living standards and wages.

So again, reading a lot of these things to create

large data sets like this.

Um, my colleague Greg, uh, is here among us.

Could you talk a bit about your research?

Oh, yes.

Right.

I'm studying.

Okay.

But first degree was in politics, philosophy and economics.

And then after a lengthy period in gainful employment.

The LSE to do the master's in economic history, which

in part thanks to some input from Jordan, morphed into

a PhD, where I'm now studying the exchange of risk

and reward for evil land transactions.

And as is explained here.

Also spends a lot of his time reading, reading medieval

that uh, so, you know, Greg is using modern day,

uh, insights in concepts about financial risk management, you know,

from a long and very successful, uh, career using that,

um, on medieval evidence to see what insights can be

found.

Uh, Will isn't here today.

Uh, Will is an early modern historian who focuses on

political economy.

Right?

Uh, specifically political, social and religious institutions.

Um, so.

You might have heard the expression that the past is,

uh, foreign country.

Right?

One of the things we need to do in this

course is to encounter, try to encounter, tackle the past

on its own terms.

Right.

Does anybody know what this is?

I'm showing you today.

Has anybody seen something like this before?

It is indeed a map.

It's a very.

There's a Latin phrase that you that you use to

describe these maps.

Anybody know?

It's a map on Monday, right?

Anybody know what that means in Latin?

Who said that?

Map of the world.

Right.

Mappa mundi.

Genitive map of the world.

Right.

So this is how, uh, 13th century thinkers thought of

the world, right?

Uh, does anybody know who this is up here?

Medieval conception of the world.

Why is there a head top?

Oh, that's God, right?

Um, but they also have a not totally inaccurate, um,

idea of how, uh, most areas of the world, uh,

save for, uh, North America, fit together.

Right?

So this is both foreign and familiar.

Simultaneously.

Right.

Um.

They have knowledge of most of the globe, right?

Uh, which, you know, might tell you that, uh, notions

of a globalised world are not at all unfamiliar to

13th century people.

Right?

There's a very persuasive argument that globalisation is not a

modern phenomenon.

Right.

Yet there's no such thing as an atheist or an

agnostic in 13th century Europe.

Everybody is a believer.

Right.

And even the very small proportion of people who might

not believe, uh, in whatever the orthodox Christianity of the

time is, you know, uh, we call them heretics.

Right.

They perhaps, you know, were dissenters, but they were still

believers in their own cosmology.

Right?

Translating to more economic terms.

This is what we're here to understand, right?

Uh, how did we, uh, break out of thousands of

years of what looks like stagnation, uh, and then come

to experience modern economic growth?

That is the fundamental question that motivates most economic historians,

right?

Um, I mean, the fundamental question that motivates most social

scientists is why are some parts of the world rich

and powerful and others poorer and weaker?

We might want to say, well, why has that been

the case in the past?

Why does it continue to be the case today?

Um, and there's a number of ways to unpick this,

right?

Um, But for us.

And our purpose is here.

What we need to do is understand that this didn't

just happen miraculously, right?

Something was happening that that was required to trigger this.

And if you want to peel the onion back, even,

you know, one more layer.

Uh, you might say that this notion of Malthusian stagnation

is a bit misleading.

Uh, simply, you know, because of the scale of this

graph, when you have to accommodate such a huge increase,

it kind of the tyranny of compression occurs and makes

it look like not that much was happening back here.

Depends on your on your view.

But that's what we're here to do, right?

Um.

Here you can plot GDP data, looking at the late

Middle Ages, the kind of the dawn of industrialisation.

And it's immediately apparent that things change hugely in some

parts of the world, and not at all in other

places.

Right?

So, you know, huge differences in modern modern day United

Kingdom, which experienced industrialisation first, huge differences in North America,

which is only just being discovered by Europeans at this

point.

Um, but, you know, you also can notice that Italy,

which had been the leading world economy in 1500, uh,

you know, hadn't grown by as much.

Um, but it definitely wasn't at the top of the

league table anymore.

Whereas places like India and Africa had changed, uh, relatively

little in terms of GDP per capita.

What we want to understand is what caused these changes,

right?

This is a course That if I do it properly,

should raise as many questions as it does answers right.

Part of that reason is data availability.

The further you go back in time, generally speaking, uh,

the less data we have.

So how do we actually recreate GDP figures of 1500?

It's not straightforward, right?

Um, so being critical economic historians, we need to look

very closely at the kind of data that underpins some

of these figures and some of these arguments.

Right.

Um, there are a range of very powerful models and

explanations to explain all of this stuff, and we are

going to visit all of them.

Your task by the end of this year is to

be able to weigh all of these different factors and

decide for yourselves and argue to Greg and I persuasively,

which factors are the most important?

Right?

Um, the first thing we need to consider, which you'll

read next week, uh, is the role of climate and

geography.

Believe it or not, this is actually a relatively new

explanatory model for economic change.

Uh, people had not thought so much about the climate

until maybe 20 or 30 years ago, but the stories

you'll read, um, for next week's class, will demonstrate very

persuasively that a number of fundamental watershed moments in economic

history coincide with changes in, uh, the kind of macro

environment.

Right.

Um.

And I think if you read one of those papers

in isolation.

You know what, Scott?

What good scholars do very well is argued persuasively.

And that's what we're trying to get to ourselves.

You read.

This or.

Think, well, maybe environment explains everything, right?

All of this can be measured in solar radiation, but

obviously the answer must be slightly more complicated than that.

Otherwise this would be a one week course, right?

What about technology?

One of the core technologies of the Industrial Revolution was

metallurgy.

Right.

Iron making.

One of the other things we've seen here, uh, is.

That.

There's not so much economic change, at least in GDP

terms.

If we believe the GDP data between, uh, in 1519

hundred inches China.

The crazy thing for pre-industrial historians is that for most

of the pre-industrial era, China was so far ahead of

Western Europe in technological terms, um, that if you time

travelled yourself back to the 14th century, and I'm starting

to think that like that might not be an impossibility

in your lifetime.

So if you do, you know, get offered that opportunity.

The thing I would tell you is that medieval historians

don't do it.

It's a bad idea.

Um, the Middle Ages are a very, very dangerous and

dirty place.

But anyway, were you to travel back to the 14th

century?

In no way would you think that England was going

to be the place that first experienced economic, modern economic

growth.

That was a technological leader, small island nation that went

on to rule most of the globe for a time.

It's utterly inconceivable England was a backwater in technological terms.

In economic terms, it was dwarf even by France, right?

Much to the chagrin, uh, of English.

Um, and one example of this is Chinese blast furnaces.

Right.

Here's some medieval manuscripts showing the very sophisticated methods that

the Chinese had to increase the temperatures of bloomers to

fully melt iron ore, leading to high quality metal.

Right.

This is not something that the Europeans discover or figure

out until the 18th century.

So technology is another thing that we need to think

about is all of this economic change simply the result

of technological developments.

Right.

And this is a topic unto itself.

I teach a third year undergraduate course only about technical

change, right?

Um, but you can see all of the important technologies

that get, uh, invented here.

But you might note, uh, how so many of them

are occurring after the 18th century.

So maybe if you were to take a technologically determinist

point of view, you might say preindustrial societies and economies

simply lacked the knowledge to create the necessary technology to

break through the ceiling and experience modern economic growth.

Right.

Is that what explains it?

Well, then, now we have two, two factors, right?

How do we balance that with the exogenous factors of

changes in the environment?

Or perhaps if we want to think about spatial differences,

inequalities, geographical endowments.

Right.

Jared Diamond argues very persuasively that one of the main

reasons Western Europe experienced modern economic growth first is that

they happen to have a geography that was suitable to

the domestication of animals and that, you know, in and

of itself, is a kind of accident of history that

allowed the Industrial Revolution to happen first in England.

Right?

Yeah.

So these blast furnaces, they existed in the first century

in China, right?

Not developed into the 14th century in Europe.

Here is another image that really encapsulates the role of

technology.

Right?

Um, this is a naval ship of the British Navy

destroying a Chinese war junk in the Opium Wars.

And it doesn't look.

I think to a modern.

Eye, that crazy, except even, you know, a few decades

before this, the situation would have been utterly inconceivable.

Right?

This is an iron clad, steam powered ship with gunpowder,

artillery, uh, blowing up time for time.

Right.

But even decades before this, uh, the Chinese had been

so far ahead in maritime technologies that it made the

ships Europeans were sailing around.

Right.

So most pre-modern people, this situation would have been so

utterly inconceivable that it would not have merited discussion.

Yet that's how history unfolded.

Population dynamics.

Right.

Is all of the this economic change simply a function

of the relationship between population and resources?

Right.

That's what Malthus thought.

That's what he argued very persuasively.

And it's a theory that still has a lot of

currency today.

Right?

How does that work here?

Uh, you know, we can look at, uh, satellite images

showing light intensity.

We use light intensity as a proxy for economic activity.

Um, and, you know, we see a lot of activity

here in northwestern Europe.

We see, uh, some a lot of activity in northwestern

Italy.

But, you know, if we go back, um, you know,

we can map this on to other economic maps as

well, right?

So perhaps this, you know, is not so different.

These are urban populations in at the beginning of the

16th century, right.

More people, more cities, more economic growth.

Is it that simple?

right?

Um, so we need to think about population dynamics as

another factor.

Uh.

So these are just three kind of sample themes and

explanatory models that we're going to investigate this year.

Uh, to ask, you know, how did the pre-industrial world

shape, you know, the modern economy that we all know

about?

Um, and how do you explain these monumental changes?

I'm going to present you with a range of different

explanations that each of them on their own are very

convincing.

Your task is to weigh them against each other, scrutinise

the evidence underpins them, and Decide which explanations you think

are most convincing.

All right, so that's my intellectual, uh, pitch to you,

um, about why this, uh, what this course is going

to offer you?

Um, we have to spend some time talking about how

the course is organised.

Uh, and then we'll take any questions that you guys

might have.

Um, yeah.

So this is Malthusian Dynamics, which we'll talk about next

week.

I think looking a little bit about, uh, relating to

the population of real wages.

Uh, sorry, actually, I have, I have a little bit

more, um, intellectual stuff to get there, actually, uh, because

another thing we'll think about is social dynamics, right?

Uh, this is, uh, you know, you might think about

feudalism and serfdom.

That's very familiar terms in the Middle Ages.

Right?

Another one of these super models is just that elites

expropriated from peasants, and that was a function of economic

growth.

Uh, and, uh, you know that that is the most

important driver of the economic trajectories we experience.

Um, another thing we have to think about is trade,

right?

This is a.

Growth.

Trade trigger specialisation.

There's a very persuasive set of literature that says it's

just trade.

That explains economic growth.

Um, the one again, we'll talk about and you'll read

about next week is looking at very compelling correlations between

climactic data and economic indicators.

Um, okay.

Uh, interestingly, actually, I don't want to get too far

into this next week.

But as I said, uh, thinking about climate is relatively

new in the world of economic history.

Um, so we're here to talk about long term processes

of growth.

These are the things that I've kind of teased.

And there's many more that we'll consider.

Um, okay, now we're all really at the practical matters.

Uh, so of course structure.

Uh, it's a year long course.

You have 20 lectures delivered by me and 20 60

minute classes taught by either Will or Greg.

Uh, classes start next week, so they're staggered, right?

I'll give you a lecture.

You use my lecture as a guide to go through

the readings and come to next week's class, having read

at least all of the essential readings.

Um, and we'll spend an hour, uh, looking at the

arguments and discussing their relative merits.

Um, this course substantively, is about understanding long run processes

of growth and the pre-industrial world more generally In terms

of its role in our in your skill development.

It's also our designated kind of reading and writing bootcamp.

Okay.

You're going to read a lot.

Uh, you're going to write a lot.

The mantra here is pretty hard.

Quite easy.

All right.

So if you stick with us, come to the lectures,

go to the classes, do the readings.

You know.

I guarantee you there.

Not only will the exam in this course were very,

uh, will be very straightforward.

If you stick with us and actively participate.

But there won't be much of anything that any of

your other classes could throw at you that you won't

be prepared to deal with, right?

Um, we're dealing with.

A world.

That you know, that, uh, spans centuries, uh, with case

studies from all over the globe.

Um, and scholarship from a range of different approaches.

I'm going to give you lots of stuff that has,

you know, a lot of econometrics.

I'm also going to give you a lot of political

history that might get right into the weeds with a

lot of jargony terms.

Right.

You're not meant to understand.

Uh, and, you know, uh, immediately, uh, be familiar with

these readings.

Right.

It takes some time to get up to speed.

In many ways, we're kind of dropping you into the

deep end, but there's no other way to grapple with

the pre-industrial world.

Uh, because we have thousands of years of history and

a range of things to explain.

This is why in the classes and in the lectures,

there's no such thing as a stupid question.

Right?

Um, so you're going to encounter terminology that you need

to familiar familiarise yourself with.

But we're also developing skills here, right?

It's possible to read strategically, reading linearly from the first

page of the last page, especially given the constraints you

might have on your time is not always the most

productive way, right?

Uh, so, you know, in this course, you'll also learn

how to strategically look for the main argument, what you

found, the main argument.

Look for the evidence.

Right.

Once you have found the main argument and the evidence,

think a little bit about what this article adds to

what you already know.

How has this article changed the way humans think about

some aspect of pre-industrial economic history?

Right.

Once you know that, you know you've looted and pillage

and pulled that out, you can spend the rest of

your time quite leisurely building, putting flesh on that skeleton.

Right?

That's what we're here to do is take in a

lot of information, pull out the most important bits.

Uh, and then marshal all of that evidence into compelling,

uh, narratives in our essays and assignments.

Um, yeah.

So we want you to do at least the essential

readings, right?

Uh, the further readings provide additional context, if you're interested.

They're also very useful for, uh, writing essays.

Okay.

Two types of assessment in the course.

Right.

Um, formative assessment.

Formative stuff does not count towards your final grade.

It is.

Uh.

What's the word I'm looking for?

Mandatory.

You're expected to do it.

Um, but it doesn't count towards your grade.

It's practice.

Right?

Uh, I would encourage you to engage with this, uh,

because it is the best opportunity we have to give.

You.

Feedback on the work you're doing so that when it

comes time to do the summative stuff, that actually does

count towards your grade, uh, your best prepared.

Right?

So this is absolutely, uh, you know, your out to

the output is correlated highly with your input, right, to

engage with the formative stuff.

The summative stuff is, uh, essay, uh, an, an exam

at the in the spring term.

Um, so the formative stuff prepares you for that.

What we expect you to do is to attend, to

participate, uh, and generally to be a good citizen and

to submit your coursework by the deadlines.

Right.

Um.

It's not only, you know, you shouldn't only come here

because I've asked you to, uh, there's a lot of

empirical evidence about grades, uh, and class attendance.

Right.

So what I will say, with years of experience behind

me of teaching this course is that if you come

to lecture, if you do the readings and you go

to class, you will find the summative assessment, the essay

on the exam very, very straightforward.

Okay.

Um, the assessment in this course is designed to give

you the widest array of opportunities to demonstrate to us

what you have learned.

It is not an opportunity for me to figure out

what you haven't learned.

If I wanted to figure out what you haven't learned,

I'd give you a multiple choice exam and, uh, save

Greg and I a lot of time.

Um, marking.

Right.

That's not what this is about.

You know, it's about giving you an opportunity to tell

us what you have learned.

So there are no surprises.

There's no trick questions.

Uh, if you come to class, come to the seminars,

do the readings, you will find all the summit to

stuff to be very straightforward.

Um, I find myself on the upper end of the

grade distribution.

What you can expect from us is we will provide

you feedback in a timely manner on all your submitted

work, which is why I implore you to engage with

the formative work.

Right.

We'll give you robust feedback on your essays.

This is your first year figuring out exactly how to

write at the university level.

Um, so the more feedback you can get, the better,

right?

Old habits form new good habits.

Um, and the best way for us to do that

is.

Through feedback.

Right?

And because the beauty of this formative work is that

the risk is zero, right?

There's, you know, no consequences for a bad essay other

than positive outcomes, because you can correct for where you've

gone wrong and calibrate for the next one.

Right.

We'll also be available to answer your questions.

Right.

The most effective way to do this is to visit

us in, uh, our office hours.

Um, okay.

So I've talked a bit about strategic reading.

Right.

That's a big thing, uh, with this is getting up

to speed on how to efficiently get through the reading

list.

Don't be daunted by it.

Uh, embrace it.

Um, and think about how you are actually reading.

Right.

One of the things you're going to do over the

course of your degree is develop your own, you know,

reading method.

There's no one size fits all approach here.

We want to think critically about it.

I've told you a little bit about my loot and

pillage approach.

It's finding the thesis, finding the evidence.

You know, thinking of it as contribution.

Right.

And if anybody wants more help about how to.

Free.

Efficiently, come see Gregory in office hours.

Right.

Um, and there's more stuff, uh, here in the slides

that you can look at.

You know, the thing, when you get to your essays.

And we will reinforce this again and again in the

classes.

Right.

We'll do lots of essay plans.

We'll do lots of support for your writing.

Right.

But we want you to have an argument.

I'm presenting you with all of the best and most

cutting edge research, uh, on the pre-industrial economy.

But not all of these authors agreed, right?

If they did, I wouldn't have a job because there'd

be no point.

You know, everybody uses different evidence has a different point

of view.

You need to weigh these against each other.

But what we want you to have is an argument.

Tell me what you find most persuasive.

Don't tell me what you feel or what you think.

Tell me which evidence and which arguments are most you

know are most effective for you.

There might be a bit of a structural break here

between what we're asking you to do in an essay

and what you have been taught to do up to

this point in high school.

Right.

Um, this isn't always a case of like, well, it

says this be said that and both of them have

merits.

And here I am sitting on the fence.

We'll never know.

Uh, which one is better?

That's not the most effective way.

Right?

We want you to have an argument.

Um.

And structure is important as well.

We've come.

We'll come from a lot of different backgrounds with, you

know, different theories about writing.

Uh, one thing I will say is that the kind

of common social sciences model, but an essay with an

introduction that tells the reader exactly what the essay will

argue, you know, with body paragraphs that explore different themes

of evidence with a conclusion that kind of restates the

thesis.

This is the most effective model, right?

This is not a whodunit.

This is not a.

Meandering.

Narrative or P.D. James novel where your genius is, you

know, rhetorically revealed in the last two sentences.

That's, you know, very hard to do.

Some of you could undoubtedly do it.

Um, but it's not a model.

Uh, the most effective model to follow.

Um, now, Greg will talk a bit more about all

the nuts and bolts of writing.

Um, to say a little bit to make sure that

when you write an essay, you have to cite all

of your sources, write some people, and this might not

be something that you're familiar with, but err on the

side of over citation.

If you're even.

If you think it is the most basic piece of

received knowledge.

The Black Death happened in 1348, right?

I know that Greg knows that.

You will know that now.

Um.

Cite that right.

Find there's no penalty for overwriting, but you can get

yourself in all sorts of trouble if you don't cite

things appropriately.

But don't spend too much time on that, because we'll

reinforce it and talk about it a little bit.

But make sure you're citing.

Right.

Um, okay.

Any questions about, you know, the intellectual aspects of the

course, things we will cover, things we, uh, won't cover

or administrative stuff.

Yeah.

What's included in the word count?

Writing essays.

Um, the word count does not include footnotes or bibliography

or tables or figures.

So just the body text.

Um, so we'll start off with, uh, I'll show you

how this works.

Um, while we're here, I go to the syllabus.

Um.

Okay.

Um, I have.

A.

Where did I upload the new one?

Okay.

I thought I have a new syllabus that I thought

I'd upload, but I haven't.

I'll upload it as soon as I get back to

my office.

The deadlines have changed, but the structure hasn't.

Right.

So this is how this is going to work.

Um, in week five.

So right now we're in week one.

In a month's time you're going to.

Write.

A 500 word essay for the essay doesn't count for

your grade.

This is going to do, uh, we're going to then

do a peer marking exercise where you'll exchange, uh, papers

with your colleagues in your classes.

This has two benefits, right?

First of all, you get to see what your colleagues

are doing.

Um, and, you know, undoubtedly you'll read something and say,

oh, I hadn't thought about that argument or I hadn't

thought about expressing this this way.

It's a fantastic way to broaden your intellectual horizons, but

it also has the externality, positive externality of demonstrating to

you, uh, exactly how we offer feedback, how we assess

things and how we offer feedback, because you're going to

use the exact same method of assessing your colleagues.

Right?

Uh, as we assess you.

Right.

So you provide feedback and, uh, then.

The end of this term.

Right?

You're going to submit a thousand word essay.

So we're getting longer.

You're able to integrate more arguments, more evidence.

And then after Christmas in the middle, uh, you take

your first stab at writing a full length 2000 word

essay.

Um, you know, I know these word lengths might sound

daunting right now, right?

I imagine that most of you, when it comes time

to do this, we'll be writing more than you can

use.

Right?

It's just a matter of building up, um, strength and

endurance, right?

The first time I thought about writing a ten page

essay in undergraduate is very daunting.

And then, you know, 20,000 word master's dissertation was also

done taking 100,000 word PhD.

And now, you know, I have a book that I'm

trying to keep under, uh, 150,000 words.

So it's not it sounds big, but you'll absolutely build

up the, um, ability to write essays at this length.

And then, you know, at the very end of winter

term.

So no need to get anxious about this yet.

This is a process that will naturally deliver you to

this.

You write, uh, your summative essay, which counts 30%, uh,

counts for 30% of your final grade.

And then there's a two hour exam in the spring

term.

Um, all exam, exam conditions book, uh, in a classroom

where we will, uh, you'll write two essay questions.

Okay.

Any other questions?

Now is the time.

There's no such thing as a bad question.

Yeah.

What's the margin of error like the way.

Uh, I mean, we're looking for quality rather than quantity.

Um, and there's no hard and fast rule of like,

plus or -10%.

Uh, if you, you know, submit, you know, for this

2000 word essay, an essay of 800 words, you know,

it would be very hard to get a top, top

mark.

If you leave, if you leave a lot of words

unused, then basically it, uh, raises questions about, you know,

could you have addressed all the issues we found or

potential areas of improvement?

You don't want to leave that much on the table.

That being said, if you could write 1800 words and

get a first class mark, no problem.

Right?

Quality rather than quantity.

Um, if you submit a 2000 word essay, uh, and

we look at it and realise that it's actually 4000

words, um, you know, that isn't a winning strategy either.

So you think of these as like upper limits.

Um, but usually, you know, the best essays will be,

you know, very close to the word limit.

There also isn't like a penalty for 2001 words, right?

So, uh, we're, you know, you don't want to go

way over, but it's an upper bound.

You agree?

Greg?

Greg agrees.

I saw a question over here.

Um, are the essays mainly focussed on content or those,

like, grammar?

Like stuff?

Mm.

That's an excellent question.

So clarity of writing and of exposition highly correlated with

high marks.

Right.

Um, so you want to do your very best to

write, uh, as clearly and radically correct as possible.

Now, there's all sorts of tools that help, like Grammarly

and, uh, stuff like that to help you get up

to speed.

Uh, that being said, you know, if you have a

comma in the wrong place, or use a split infinitive

or something.

We're not going to mark you down 10%, right?

So these are things that we will give you feedback

on and help you.

Right?

So do your very best.

Uh, you know, if part good grammar is part of

the whole package.

Right?

But we're, you know, we're not going to, um, unfairly,

you know, fail you for having, uh, not used an

apostrophe correctly, although apostrophe.

Right for possessives, not for plurals.

Uh, I'm an old man, right?

Apostrophes for plurals are like this.

Uh, but we won't mark you down for the first

time.

Uh.

All right.

Any other questions?

Yeah.

Yeah.

All right.

Do we have to worry about, like, citations?

No.

Okay, so.

First thing is, don't worry too much about the exam

because we will get there, right?

Um, you know, we're surfing here, right?

It's going to take us to shore.

Uh, but when you write an exam under close conditions,

we're not expecting you to site.

We're not expecting you to have footnotes.

We're not expecting you to have a bibliography.

Right.

Um, because you can't remember all of that stuff.

Uh, now, will you have Lin White and his infamous

syrup thesis imprinted on your brain?

I've talked about it so much that there's no way

that you could write Lin White without, you know, and

this thorough without thinking.

Lin White, 1962.

That's entirely possible, right?

Some of that stuff will just happen organically.

It's not really a good use of your time to

remember names and dates and citations, because, you know, we

don't.

So it's not necessary to cite a good essay, might

say, you know, thinking about technological determinism and the role

of, as Lyn might argue, that shows me that you've

remembered that, but we're not looking for citations.

Greg said about the previous one.

The department does have writing duties.

Ah, yeah.

Yeah.

So there are.

Resources in the department.

To help.

Right.

But we want you.

We're here to help you improve your academic writing.

Right.

We're not here to chastise you, um, for, uh, arcane

bits of grammar.

We're here to help.

Right.

So I wouldn't worry too much about your grammar.

I will undoubtedly give you feedback on areas where your

grammar could be improved.

And you should take that on board.

And you should integrate it, because it's just part of

the whole package that allows you to write faster.

Um, okay.

Anything else?

Any other.

Questions?

Yes.

I'm going to return to time.

You can do it on the computer.

Question.

Oh, yeah.

Your office.

Hours?

Yeah, they're.

On the Moodle, but they are Tuesdays from 230 till,

uh, 4:00.

You book on lock for you.

Greg and Will will have office hours as well.

And I'll post them on the Moodle.

Uh, is.

There another one I saw somewhere?

Greg, do you want to add anything?

I just yes, if I may, if I could make

a plea for at least for the half of you,

roughly, I guess that would be on Monday.

Please look at the readings over the weekend.

Um, yeah.

Unless Jordan has changed the video.

Watch.

So either watch that or read the article by Bruce

Campbell and the Jared Diamond piece is fairly easy read

as well.

So yeah.

So this is what the this is what the reading

list list.

Look every week there's essential and further readings.

We expect you to come to class uh, with um,

the essential readings done.

Um, now here's an issue on the syllabus.

There's a link to a video, uh, typically which will

upload to the electronic reading list as well.

But as you can see, that is it is here

on week one as well.

So it's always worth checking my PDF syllabus against the

electronic reading list.

The PDF is like the definitive list.

Uh, you know, 98% of the stuff should be in

the electronic reading list, but I haven't given you a,

you know, a whole bunch of guidance in this lecture

about environmental stuff other than we need to think about

exogenous factors.

So go, uh, read these readings and then come prepared

for your class next week to discuss them.

Um, I mean, Bruce Campbell is one of the most

entertaining, um, lectures you can find.

So, uh, please do watch the video.

It's a good it's a good, uh, it's a good

primer.

Um.

All right.

Any final questions?

Thank you very much.

Oh, yeah.

Sorry.

Yeah.

So we do these readings before I.

Use my lecture as a guide to get you through,

uh, the reading.

See you next week.

I like to do I.

Like.

Reading.

I feel.

Like.

I have to make it, you know?

Yeah.

I thought you got to do it before.

That's why I've already done it.

Can you.

Oh.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

So they sit in that park.

That's what.

I think.

It's like bear stuff.

Yeah.

I'll see you guys later.

Yes, I suppose it is.

But it feels like it should.

That sounds like it.

Later on, like there's a lot of space.

I think the idea is that.

You go into it.

Yeah.

Thank you.

That is exactly what and why.

I say this.

You.

You know that's what you.

Do in class.

Think about.

Them.

You don't use them as a guide.

To you.

And.

Others as you.

Said.

You.

Were good.

So.

Holly James, you'll also be able to.

Follow.

Well, how would you know?

When you know.

You know more.

About what?

You know.

That's.

What I know.

When?

He comes in the door.

Or at that time.

Or you.

Know.

Just.

Come here.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Here.

Thank you.

Thank you for letting her.

Oh.

Walking out of class.

Uh oh.

Two and two downtown.

Thank you, thank you.

Oh, no.

No, no.

Oh, hell no.

I know, I know, I.

Know.

You know what I do?

Not wish.

Don't make.

Up your.

Mind when you're trying to ask your question.

Hello?

Oh, yes, Baba.

We're holding a.

Measuring cup.

Hi.

Hi.

Thank you sir.

Don't get.

Me wrong.

I have shown you.

You know.

Lecture 2:

That's.

Terrible.

Oh.

The math.

Just thinking, like I wanted to skip the library.

Yeah, I'm like you.

Know, it's just.

Done A-levels before?

Yeah.

It's just that for me, it's all I got.

Once you explain the concept.

Understand it again, but I.

Actually was like, actually.

You.

Know, I'm not spotless.

So that's why.

I.

Nice.

Yeah.

Yeah.

That's just what I tell you, though.

Yeah.

Uh.

Yeah.

Okay.

Just not the lecture.

Oh, I haven't been reading.

So, basically, what are you talking about?

Like, uh, seven and 15.

Did you.

Watch this?

Yeah, I did.

I was like, okay.

Didn't you just go, wow.

Like I shifted everything.

How do you know someone who has.

Stuff like that.

It's.

Not for.

Me?

Do you understand?

Which ones did you do recently?

Um, I did.

I mean, no.

Matter how.

Much money.

I read you were in the clear.

Yeah, I was.

It was very unproductive.

What do you mean?

I hate the bad guys.

I'm in the dark.

You need to just stop.

I'm sorry.

Yeah.

You're really.

Sorry.

Also I don't.

Want to go wrong.

I'm so stupid.

You know when I, when I, I.

All right.

When you said.

Okay, let me see that wrong.

So we're gonna.

Take a little.

Time for sure.

So I'm just hoping this week.

Maybe.

Maybe you're telling me this.

It was not rational to.

Go check it.

Check it out.

I was I've done this.

I haven't done.

This.

Yes, yes.

And also.

No No no, no.

I like to go.

Did you.

Ever see where we're going?

Yes.

Yeah, I'm on it.

I just.

Need you to read it.

I found the read, by the way.

No, I didn't think so.

As soon as you.

Find out you're not.

Yeah, my skills are not.

Oh, yeah.

I haven't done this.

Yeah.

And.

You didn't.

Are.

You nuts?

Yeah.

Yeah.

Okay.

Oh, okay.

I actually did, I.

Didn't like that.

I appreciate it.

I'm starving.

I'm sweating a tablespoon.

Um.

Um.

You.

Know what else?

Could it be?

Yeah.

This in.

Certain.

Ways is important to the whole team to win every

Out of the oven.

The war in Iraq is something must be done.

400 years old.

Yeah.

So let me run.

So I don't want to bother.

Oh, this is crazy.

No, I didn't mean that.

It's fine.

Oh, my people go insane.

How's everybody doing?

Uh.

Anybody, uh, recognise the song of.

Any Metallica fans in the audience?

Anybody in the audience heard of Metallica before?

I'm seeing one nodding head.

I'm dating myself.

Um, so that was Metallica.

Uh.

Creeping death.

Um, if anybody has a suggestion for song of the

week, um, you know, a title that in some way

connect spiritually with what we're talking about.

Uh, please do send me your suggestions.

Um, and if they're they're better than mine, I will

use them.

Um, does anybody know.

What.

This famous, uh, picture is?

I've 16.

That's one poor.

Thing.

Yeah.

It's called the full force.

Hold on.

Okay.

Yeah.

So I've foreshadowed the artwork of the week.

Um, I'm working on, you know, providing a cultural portfolio,

uh, for each of the week.

So we have song of the week, artwork of the

week.

I think I might start adding, uh, novel of the

week.

Do you have any suggestions for novel of the week,

Greg?

I've got some for plague.

Right.

And just reading The Decameron.

Is a good one, you know.

Yeah, yeah.

Malthusian novel.

Uh, anyway, so this is Albrecht Dürer, right?

Uh, the four horsemen.

The four horsemen of the apocalypse.

Does anybody know who the Four Horsemen are?

No.

Dürer fans.

Uh, we'll get there.

Okay, so I think I probably showed you this yesterday,

right?

This is what we are here to do.

Uh, to explain what you can only grow.

Right.

But.

There's this long period of apparent kind of cyclical stagnation

before population and, uh, GDP both take off somewhere in

relatively recent history.

Uh, this comes from the work of Greg Clark, uh,

who labels this period of stagnation a malthusian trap.

Right.

So what does that mean?

Right?

Well, that's what we're going to do today, is try

to understand what is this Malthusian trap?

And does it actually explain This period of stagnation, right?

Whatever it.

Is.

Is it the prime mover?

That explains this lack of growth?

Um, right.

So what we're going to consider today.

It's population and resources.

That's what.

Is considered and is what we're going to reconsider today.

Right.

So why populations?

Um, well, the first thing in humans, it's like the

fundamental factor of production, right?

Cannot have economic growth even today without labour.

If you want labour, any humans.

So what we're going to do today is try to

understand kind of what the trends and characteristics of the

Eurasian population are.

Right.

So we're focusing on Europe.

I'll bring in some comparisons with China and in the

eastern world.

Um, we want to understand the forces behind the, uh,

changes and the demographic trends that we observed, changes in

population and what the implications of these demographic systems are.

So what we want to ask today is what do

we know about long term population?

When are the key transitions and uh, what are the

pre-industrial population.

Right.

We're here to understand how pre-industrial economies function, how they

grew, how they stagnated, how they shrunk, um, and how

they maybe set the stage for what was to come

later.

We're going to ask, what does population have to do

with all of this?

Right.

So I showed you that, um, hockey stick curve of

GDP.

Right.

We can also see a hockey stick curve in, uh,

population.

Right.

And this is particularly striking if we go really far

back in time.

Right.

The point here is that modern levels of population are

historically unprecedented.

Right.

We have huge periods of kind of geological time where

population stayed the same, and then relatively recently it has

exploded.

Uh, and this is exactly right.

So what is the population of the Earth now?

It's probably the 8 billion or something.

So, uh, now if we compress our temporal horizons a

bit starting in the year zero, right, we start to

see the shape a little bit, but still unprecedented growth.

And, you know, growth is slow and steady from, let's

say, the year 1000, uh, beyond 1500.

But then something happens in these five centuries here and

it takes off.

So one of the first things to appreciate, uh, if

we're considering the pre-industrial period, um, as against the modern

period, right?

In our first aim was to understand what trends in

population actually are.

Is that something called the demographic transition happened at some

point between 1500 and a year or 2000, right.

And that's what the graphic transition seems to coincide with

this huge explosion in population.

Has anybody heard about the demographic transition so far in

their journey?

Does anybody know this term have a definition?

Okay.

Demographic transition is simply, uh, the reversal of, you know,

equilibrium between equilibrium, uh, between, uh, birth rate and death

rates.

Right.

And most if not all of the places in the

world in 2024, and I sensed a demographic transition, right?

But it happens at different times in different places in

history.

But what you need to know is that, you know,

in the past we had librium.

Where birth rates were high, death rates were also high.

Right?

Lots of children born.

You know, you don't have to go very far back.

My mother was one of eight, right?

You don't have to go very back, very far back

in history before you start seeing very large families.

Birth rates are high, but so are death rates, right?

Lots of children born.

Many of them don't make it to adulthood.

Then we transition to the situation we're in now where

birth rates and death rates are low.

Right?

Fewer children born, but you way more children make it

to adulthood.

Remember?

Yes.

Last week I showed you that map kind of spatially

indexed to child mortality and shrunk, especially in the developed

world, quite a bit, right?

Um.

Now.

How does this create population growth?

Well, the key thing here is that the death rate

falls before the birth rate does.

So societies get better, uh, with health interventions, maybe fewer

wars.

Uh, you know, all of these things mean fewer of

us die.

Uh, but for a time, time being, for a period

of time, uh, deaths are going down, but births of

staying high.

So you see a huge explosion in population before the

birth rate starts to decrease at all.

This is a transition, right?

Uh, and the important thing to remember is that when

we're thinking about relations between population and resources in the

preindustrial world, we're often dealing with a fundamentally different demographic

equilibrium where pre demographic transition birth rates were high, death

rates also high.

Right.

It's a very different situation to the one we live

in today.

So um, you can see uh, also that perhaps, you

know, there is something here that suggests that maybe birth

rates are going to start to rise again.

Uh, there's also projections that show, um, that, uh, you

know, things are going down in terms of population groups.

So like, uh, there's lots of different projections that suggest

maybe there's a reversal or there's another transition coming, um,

Europe and China.

Right.

Let's just try to get a bit of a global

picture of this.

The takeaway points from this graph, again going back to

the year 1000, is that the trends in Europe and

China are very similar.

Um, but the scale of population, and that's going to

be important when we start thinking about Malthusian models and

how well they fit in Europe and relative to how

well they fit in China.

Um, trends of similar levels of population in China, significantly

higher than they are for even all of Europe.

Right.

Um, and then if we just instead of looking at

if you look at rates a little bit compressed in

1419 50, again, you see similar trends, perhaps a bit

more volatile in China.

But growth rates have, uh, exploded in the 20th century

in China.

Um, up until 1950.

Anyway, so how do we explain this pattern?

Right.

Is this population growth right?

Or are we just looking at numbers relative to each

other, but also have a, uh, role in explaining, um,

the huge population of hockey stick that we saw.

Right?

So we're seeing slow and steady population growth rates, uh,

in both Europe and China.

But do they explain how we, you know, broke through

some kind of population ceiling to get the huge explosion?

Um, we've seen on the previous graphs, right.

Or is this.

Volatility?

Is it just in cycles that come and go but

not a huge meaningful trend?

Right.

Because again, if you zoom out and look at only,

uh, nominal figures that I've showed you previously, everything looks

a little bit flat.

Um, so as I said, global population growth unprecedented.

But it was preceded by rising population both in Europe

and in China.

Right.

So how do we explain this?

That's what we need to do.

Um, so no, that's right.

Uh, who is Thomas Malthus, and why should we care

about him?

Right.

Uh, well, here's a good, uh.

The 15th century says there's nothing better in life than

death, war and wine.

Because if no one would die in ten years, there'd

be such misery on earth that everyone would need to

worry about dying of starvation right now.

First wrote his essay On the Principle of Population in

1798.

Right.

And he basically articulated this theory that we'll see that

there's a simple but inexorable mechanical relationship between population and

resources.

Like a pulley.

One goes up, the other goes down, and vice versa.

Interestingly, you know, he wasn't the first person to think

about this.

If you have a 15th century, um, chronicler Articulating, you

know, not the mechanism, perhaps, but the phenomenon that if

people don't die, uh, then all the resources will be

consumed and we'll all be starving, right?

Um, so the Malthusian model that he first articulated 1798,

is this right?

The population and resources are a simple mechanical relationship, and

that, uh, the determinants of population are entirely endogenous, right?

Uh, so we're contrasting endogenous with exogenous.

Right.

Can anybody remember, uh, tell me what we mean when

we say exogenous factor.

What's an exogenous factor?

I think we we talked about this a bit.

Yeah.

That affects the system of.

Something that impacts the system from outside.

Meaning those within the system have no utility over it.

They're just reacting imposed from outside.

That's an exogenous factor.

And if you think about, you know, in binary terms

and this thing is then something that's going to be

from inside the system, right.

Which implies those within the system, humans, uh, have some

agency over it.

Right.

Uh, so this as soon as it gets important right

now, it is assumed that, uh, population resources, uh, are

a simple mechanical relationship, like a pulley, right?

One goes up, the other goes down.

Um, but that they're entirely endogenous, right?

Living standards explain a population.

Population explains living standards.

Uh, he also assumed that, uh, the economy needs.

We're operating at the margins.

Right.

And faced declining marginal returns.

Can anybody tell me what I mean by this?

Anybody want to take a stab at it?

What do I mean by an economy is operating at

the margins?

Yeah.

So as extra resources say, labour is added to economic

processes, the output, extra factories you're finding.

Yeah.

So that you're at the margin.

So every additional input will produce less of an output.

Right.

The best the best example of this I think is

a dishwasher.

I lived for years without a dishwasher.

Then it kind of got to a certain point in

my household where, you know, two roads diverged in a

yellow wood.

It was going to be dishwasher or divorce.

Um, so my wife.

And I got water and it was fantastic.

Saves our marriage.

Um, you don't have to wash dishes anymore.

I don't have to argue about who's going to wash

the dishes.

I don't have to look at dishes.

I think it's fantastic.

Then you think, well, maybe one is good too.

Must be better.

Like, what happens if I have a second dishwasher?

You know, perhaps it's a little bit better every once

in a while when I have friends over.

Um.

And I can clean up more quickly because I can

fit all of the dishes in dishwashers.

The third dishwasher.

Absolutely useless.

Actually, it may be negative because it takes up space

in my kitchen.

Has cost me capital, and it uses energy.

Um, so that's the whole idea, right?

This is what Malthus assumes a colony is that the

margin faces declining marginal returns.

Um, right.

The other thing we have to remember is that this

is all happening before the demographic transition, right?

I didn't know about the demographic transition hasn't really happened

yet.

But that's the other thing we need to think about

here.

All these things.

Malthus said, ah, he's coming from a world of high

birth rates and high death rates.

Yeah.

So, Uh, the central assumptions is that population will increase

geometrically or exponentially.

Right?

Same thing.

You might encounter both terms in the literature.

There's geometric growth.

Exponential growth.

Right.

Um, but, uh, the supply uh, would only increase arithmetically

or linearly.

Right.

Again.

So you see linear or arithmetic means the same thing.

Um, right.

So what do we deduce from these assumptions that, you

know, if population is growing geometrically or exponentially and resources

can only increase arithmetically or linearly?

Uh, at some point population is going to outstrip the

supply of food, and it's going to be a big

problem, uh, because people are going to starve, as the

Chronicle in the 15th century said, right.

The other thing.

That kind of.

You know, spills over from this is that if you

accept this mechanical relationship, right?

Population is geometric, resources are linear.

You're going to reach this crisis point that eventually, if

left to their own devices, humans will reproduce like rabbits

to the point where they don't have enough food.

Then there's a number of things that we need to

think about, right?

Food is going to outrun its supply, but therefore that

also means that any growth in population is going to

trigger a fall in average income.

Right?

More people mean everybody who is there is going to

be worse off.

Um, and the lower your average income might be, uh,

the worse conditions get, right?

Uh, the less the worse things get lower fertility, fewer

babies are going to be born and mortality will be

higher.

Um, and the other kind of Malthusian supposition.

Uh, remember, he's saying the technology is, uh, operating or

economy is operating at the margins.

Technical challenge isn't going to help because it just creates

more people.

Uh, so technological change will just create more food, which

then allows more people, uh, and then more people will

just reduce, uh, the living standards.

Right?

This is the evolution argument.

So, you know.

Simple thing that Malthus articulated.

Population resources can't escape that reality.

One goes up, the other goes down.

You've got these four other, uh, conditions that arise.

Right.

So there's more.

Because we never get to this crisis period, right?

This never happens.

Because before we get there, we have checks operating on

the population that ensure it basically never outstrips the supply

of food.

Two kinds.

Of checks.

One is positive.

If you read positive check quality, what does mortality mean?

People are dying.

That's one kind of way to limit the population so

that we all have enough food to eat.

Uh, other things that constrains population growth.

Malthus calls a preventative check.

And this is basically babies not being born, right?

Um, so positive check kills people that are already alive.

Preventative checks stops new people from being born.

And those things or some combination of them.

Limit the size of the population in an economy or

a society so that it never, uh, outstrips its resources.

You know, creeping death.

Well.

Uh, Albert, there's four horsemen of the apocalypse.

They're all positive.

Check.

Right.

When you think when you read positive, check.

Think.

Think.

They're right.

Horsemen of the apocalypse.

Um.

Or famine?

Um, right.

So, uh, here's what European population trends look like from

1000 to 1800.

We have some differences here, right?

So basically, uh, you know, the Malthusian orthodoxy would say

England has low population and high living standards.

France, relative to England especially, has higher population and lower

living standards.

Right.

So yeah, this is there again.

We have war, we have famine, we have death.

Uh, and, you know, all of these positive checks, uh,

kill kings and commoners alike, you know, along along with

pestilence.

Now, the preventative check.

So this is the opposite of the dir would cut

this thing to stop babies from being born.

Right.

Well, how does that actually work in pre-industrial societies?

How do we control population, especially if there's one of

the Malthusian assumptions is that humans will reproduce unconstrained.

Well, um, any behaviour that lowers fertility rate is a

preventative check.

Preventive check.

So one thing is that, um, one assumption that kind

of looms large in the literature here.

Some blogs, uh, from leading demographers that look at this.

Uh, quite interestingly, they'll be on the Moodle.

Um, one assumption here is that in the pre-industrial world,

sex only occurs within marriage.

Right.

Um, and that's something we have to be a bit

critical of.

Is that a reasonable thing to think?

Now, remember, it might seem totally unreasonable to us.

We live in a largely, you know, um.

Agnostic society.

Uh, I think 2023 might have been the first year

in recorded history that more children were born to unmarried

couples, uh, unmarried, unwed mothers, perhaps, um, than, uh, married

people.

So, you know, we probably don't think of childbirth as

being particularly correlated to marriage, but in the past.

Right.

There's no such thing as an agnostic.

Everybody is religious.

The church is very important, you know.

So marriage actually does have an effect on fertility.

Of course, people are having sex outside of marriage.

Um, but actually one thing that's very, very interesting is

that you can look and see that even in the

past, a really high proportion of preindustrial marriages, uh, obviously

happened after a child had been conceived.

Um, so anyway, but contraception, whatever form that might have

taken in the pre-industrial world, they don't have oral contraception.

There are other ways.

Uh, and then, you know, uh, celibacy, which is non-trivial,

right?

There's a lot of people who remain celibate, not only,

um, part of this is, you know, unwillingness, you know,

unintentional people who just cannot find mates.

Um, and, you know, uh, the kind of more sinister

things of, uh, like infanticide play a role here as

well.

You might think that infanticide, which is like, you know,

purposely killing a native born, should be a positive check.

But we find that under the preventive system.

Right?

Um, so there's a lot of different ways this can

play out.

Uh, so, you know, once we look at the relationship

between population and resources, right, the birth rate or the

death rate goes up.

Right?

We get a range of different equilibria, right?

If we fix the birth rate and the death rate

and technology, we get a stagnant population, right?

Um, but, you know, if you start graphing how all

of this stuff works out and you think about, well,

uh, if we're below the long term equilibrium, the population

will grow until the period that income falls to subsistence

levels, and the birth rate is then going to equal

the death rate, right?

Don't worry about these graphs too much.

Right.

This is just, uh, some of us probably think, you

know, in words.

Thousands of others.

You might be conditioned to think in graphs.

Uh, this is for the camp.

Um, you know, I'm not going to ask you to

recreate these on an exam.

Uh, but you can send them, uh, as a resource

if they're useful for the way your brain works.

Right.

But you can just see in graphical form how the

these, uh, this mechanical relationship plays out in different scenarios.

Right?

Here is how this, you know, kind of element of

the Malthusian orthodoxy works and an improvement in technology lead

to population increase again until income falls back to subsistence

levels and the birth rate equals the death rate once

more.

Right.

Um, you know, so.

Um, this sum everything up, right, is what Malthus thought

in 1798, right.

It gives an account of populations that were experiencing stagnant

living standards.

Uh, he says that the levels of population will be

controlled endogenously, either through preventive or positive checks.

And he assumes that economic growth is absent.

So.

It's happened, you know, since Malthus wrote this, uh, you

know, Malthus is very much like an armchair intellectual.

It's very, very interesting how kind of like the canon

of Western thought.

There's a lot of very powerful and persuasive models that

were written by white men in a particular period of

time.

Right.

Malthus still looms large in our thinking of demography.

Right.

Freud would probably be another one.

Uh, anyway, um, was Malthus right?

That's what we need to think about.

Uh, well, if we want to proxy living Standards using

wage data, which is something that we'll get into.

You know, considering down the road, let's say we accept

that, uh, with population and real wages as a proxy

for living standards, we see that they move together kind

of more or less.

Um, here's a graphical Greg Clark that, you know, isn't

showing linearly, but it shows population on one side, um,

uh, real wage levels as a proxy for living standards.

You basically see the population and living standards move together.

Now, Malthus thought he had a universal system here, right?

That his model should apply.

Uh, everywhere.

At any time.

Um, so how does that actually work?

Right?

Uh, you know, and this is this is coming directly

from the source.

Right.

So he says Europe, uh, can accommodate more population.

Uh, and he says, you know, basically saying here that

things are nice and rosy in Europe.

Um, but in other places, uh, the population is, has

been forced.

Right.

Uh, because people are living on lower living standards and

not eating very much food.

Right.

He said this must be due to increasing the population

when the means of subsistence did not.

Uh, he says the right seems to answer this description.

Now, here, here's the critical thing.

Right.

If accounts if the accounts we have of it are

to be trusted.

So he never worked on that, much less having any

kind of robust statistics from China.

Uh, he says people are, uh, living off the smallest

quantity of food.

Uh, and they will accept anything that Europeans wouldn't have

eaten.

Right.

Um, and this is why famines happen in China.

But this is like, you know, starting to sound like,

uh, the 18th century situation.

Like my, my dad watching stupid YouTube videos.

Fake news.

Right?

Um, basically, this did not have a handle on what

was going on in China necessarily.

So should we believe, uh, that, uh, his system, um,

was right.

Probably not.

Um, that said, there's a lot of scholars who, in

good faith have come along since Malthus and said, well,

let's test this.

Right.

Let's see how this works.

And what there tends to be now is a bifurcation

in the literature, right?

A group of people who say, yeah, actually, it's slightly

more complicated than Malthus first articulated.

There's some variants, but more of that population resources holds.

Right.

And this is how it works.

And there's other people that will say, okay, no, uh,

this doesn't work at all.

Uh, and I'll show you a chart that kind of

out.

But within the mythology world.

So assuming, you know, these are the decisions you start

have to, you know, have to start making in this

course.

Are you a malthusian?

Are you not?

Malthus.

Genius, right.

But if you want to remain a malthusian ist, but

you need to be able to make your system fit,

uh, you know, both in England and in continental Europe

and in China.

How do you do that?

We have dramatically different levels of living standards, dramatically different

sizes of populations.

Well, here we get the idea that we have Malthusian

systems that just live at different equilibria.

Right.

So how this works in England is an illusion, a

system, but a low pressure Malthusian system.

Right?

Low pressure.

Right.

There's basically population remains low.

There's enough resources to go around.

So how might the population be adjusted?

Because remember going to the system living standards explained population.

Population explains living standards.

How does it work?

Well, it works by adjustment on the preventive check right?

Population is regulated by fertility, regulated by the number of

babies being born or not.

That's the account.

How do we explain then lower living standards in Europe?

Well, Malthusian to say actually this is a higher pressure

Malthusian system.

Right here the population is regulated primarily by mortality.

There's more warnings in Europe.

Um, living standards are lower.

And in Asia.

Right.

The orthodox Malthus, you know, say this is the highest

pressure regime adjustment, almost totally by mortality, very low living

standards.

So this is basically how it works.

This is one of very many flowcharts or decision trees.

Right to decide pathogen Population Resources model is one of

the big one of the three big explanatory super models

that you're going to see, right?

In saying that this is the prime mover that explains,

uh, the trajectories of different economies, right?

Well, if you're a malthusian, you subscribe to that logic.

You have to decide then, whether the case you're looking

at is pressure or a low pressure regime.

Right.

And then if you want to think about, uh, you

know, some further nuances, you can just file yourself as

a neo malthusian, or you might say, hey, this binary,

you know, kind of two factor model population resources doesn't

really work.

All right.

You know, population, um, actually creates innovation.

And technical change is more important than Malthus gave us

credit for.

Or the economy isn't actually operating at the margins Or

that mortality is exogenous rather than endogenous.

You know, then you leave the Malthusian camp, right?

So what is this low pressure regime?

Are there any is there any evidence for this preventive

check working in the way that Malthusian note that I'm

saying Malthusian is here and not Malthus himself.

We've moved on from Malthus articulated pontificated to people who

are working with data and testing Malthus theories and models.

Right?

Um, so Tony Wrigley and Roger Scofield, and then their

work later taken up by Clark, are all proponents of

this low pressure regime, right?

Uh, Wrigley.

Schofield we're working with Cambridge, um, Cambridge Centre, Cambridge group

for the history of population, social structure.

Um.

They say low pressure regime adjustment by nationality, which is

just a word for rates of marriage.

Uh, you know, and then there's this assumption that people

don't have babies in their married quality and fertility are

highly intertwined, creates high living standards.

You know, mortality only has a very small role to

play here.

Um.

They say population remains low and living standards high because

fertility, the number of babies being born, is regulated and

kept low from the European marriage pattern.

Right.

Uh, so this is why we the English situation unfolds

like this.

Um, and so what is this European marriage pattern?

Well, it's a kind of explanation to explain this phenomenon,

right?

Um, that marriage rates of marriage seem to respond to

living standards.

When incomes are high, more people get married.

When incomes are low, a few people get married.

How does this work?

Right.

And how?

Well, what happens here is that you have a pool

in any society or economy of women of childbearing age

who could be having children and raising the population and

therefore lowering living standards, etc., etc..

Um, the readings on this that you can look at

almost.

Discussed in the seminar.

Um, there's a long literature of the European marriage pattern.

The idea basically is, is that if given the opportunity,

women will choose To not get married or get married

later and have fewer children later.

Um, if they aren't economically forced into getting marriage right.

So in some places you have inheritance, you know, that

can only happen once you're married, uh, etc., etc. so

women get, you know, there's no opportunities, few opportunities for

most women to expand their human capital, go to school,

uh, become an apprentice, join the guild.

So their only path, uh, to prosperity, you know, is

to get married.

You know, uh, Daniel first observed.

And he's working at Cambridge as well, you know, 1962,

1965 around there is that in northwestern Europe you see

women getting later or married later or not at all,

uh, because there were more opportunities, more economic agency for

them Then it was in south eastern Europe.

And when you, you know, some women don't marry or

the ones we do that don't get married until later,

ultimately they have fewer children, right?

Because all the children that we're getting could conceivably been

born here or here don't get born.

So this is the European marriage pattern, right?

Women get married later or not at all, have fewer

children.

Um, and we want to wonder, like, how convincing is

this?

Right.

Well, some of the cracks in the facade that might

appear is that mortality in England might be more so

a factor than these scholars thought.

Right.

One of the things is that the sources that these

scholars use to articulate this don't really start being created

until the early modern period, meaning that they don't or

can't.

Uh.

Mr..

They're locked up, right?

So they're saying he's not that big of a deal

anymore, but conveniently they're not looking at, you know, 60%

reduction in the population in 15, 48 to 50.

So that's kind of convenient for this argument, right?

Perhaps not their fault, but it is their problem.

Um, because if you expand your temporal horizons, the Black

Death, there's no way of escaping that mortality must have

been important.

Um, right.

Uh, and the range of other things.

The other the other thing is that they're saying on

average, living standards were high in England.

But actually behind that average, there's quite a lot of

variance is the whole distribution for poor people who might

be obscured by a single number and a single year

for an average might actually have been living under very

low pressure conditions.

Um, even if we exclude the Black Death.

We can also still see that mortality is not, uh,

inconsequential in England.

Right?

Um, so does this model work?

Right?

Well, we're seeing some, uh, you know, a broad consensus

for the preventive check working pretty well in England, but

perhaps, uh, mortality hasn't been taken seriously enough.

Right?

The other problem with thinking about mortality in this positive

check is that Malthus assumed it worked both ways.

Right?

Malthusian.

Most of them probably accepted it.

Work both ways, right.

That obviously, um, population is affected by famine and disease.

Right.

But, you know, it didn't work both ways.

So, uh, another issue here is that it's not necessarily

an endogenous thing, as Malthus assumed, right?

Famines might be created by exogenous climactic effects.

Uh, you know, the Black Death we just talked about

was a, you know, exogenous impacted plane, right?

The whole if you're a malthusian, yes, this has to

be in godliness, right?

Mortality is not always endogenous, right.

Sometimes it's very exogenous.

Um, so we have to think about think about that.

Right.

We're seeing, you know, uh, quite a big swing in

living standards.

You know, in 1350, 60% of the population dies.

Therefore, there's more, you know, fewer slices of the pie.

And therefore, uh, living standards go up, um, after the

Black Death comes.

Right.

We might look at China and also as a kind

of zero in the quiver of mortality being an exogenous,

possibly exogenous event.

Um, this here is, you know, a case where War

rather than causation.

But somebody has pointed out, you know, low periods of

temperature, kind of climate anomalies tend to coincide with the

end of dynasties.

Uh, you could look at this Kelly and O'Grady article,

uh, which actually shows that the relationship of, uh, living

standards and, um, mortality quite different for peasants rather than

lords.

Right.

So obviously that's again the tyranny of averages thing.

Right?

Uh, if we put all of these people together, we

get a story.

But you have, you know, a certain group of people

living much better than other people.

Right?

So before we can talk about the causality definitively, we

need to think about how this positive check system works.

Right.

And the problem here is that Malthus thought it works

both ways, but actually there's not as much of a

link between nutrition and susceptibility to disease, as Malthus thought.

Right.

Um, famine deaths, often due to migration or trade.

Right.

So in that way, it's kind of business as well.

If foreign merchants bring the, you know, the pestilence to

your community, there's nothing about your endogenous system like low

living standards that created those famine deaths and mortality differentiated

by status, as we've just seen.

So write this positive check system.

Remember the whole purpose here to test the Malthusian logic?

Um, mortality works because high mortality will obviously create low

population.

Lots of people dying populations is lower.

Lower population will create high living standards.

And this is basically what happens in the Black Death.

There's less empirical evidence for high population creating low living

standards that then creates high mortality rate.

So the causation might not work both ways.

And actually a lot of mortality is exogenous.

Right.

So where does that leave us.

Well we're trying to test the Malthusian system.

We might say, uh, that this doesn't work uh, as

well.

Um, so the last thing to think about here, I

showed you that flowchart, um, that said, are you an

author?

Yes.

Okay.

Well, then is it a high pressure or is it

a low pressure regime?

I said, well, actually, if you decide you're not the

Malthusian, this, uh, and we've seen some evidence here, uh,

that suggests that there's some cracks in the logic doesn't

work.

It's not definitely not as universal as a malthusian self

assumed it would be.

One of the examples, uh, is Esther.

Both are upright.

Um, because she will say Malthus assumed that technology couldn't

live, raise living standards.

Right?

Um, and even if it did raise living standards, gains

were only temporary.

The living standards would rise and then population would rise,

and then it would bring living standards down again.

Right.

But what she actually argues that population, when it increases,

will also proportionally increase levels of innovation.

Right.

So the more population you have, the more innovation you

have.

And that breaks out of this cycle of involution.

Um, and is it just one of the potential alternatives

that we will explore, uh, in.

Some subsequent.

Weeks.

Right.

And this is the idea that necessity is the mother

of invention.

Okay.

So we've talked about population trends in the very long

run, established that there's like two sides to this, you

know, demographic transition or before and after.

We've talked about what the long run population trends are.

We try to understand what shapes determines population.

And then we try to understand what the implication of

the changes between population and resources are.

We've used methods of the lens.

Right.

Um, he had these ideas in the in the 18th

century.

They're still very persuasive at the time.

They're still very prominent today.

However, there's been a lot of empirical testing and the

literature and things are still divided.

Right?

This is still contested right up until, uh, this very

moment.

Right there are, uh, very, uh, you know, successful famous

economic historians who say Malthus is mostly right.

There's others who will say, uh, this doesn't work nearly

as well as, uh, Malthus or his followers thought it

did.

The first kind of supermodel that I've introduced you to

write, and what you need to do going forward now

is to, you know, weigh the evidence and the persuasiveness

of this explanation, you know, on its own merits and

then against the other things.

Right, because we need to think more about technology, right?

We need to think more about the role of exogenous

factors that we, you know, talked a bit about last

week and you'll read about in your, uh, seminars.

Um, and you know, what we're going to talk about

next week is kind of surrounds another supermodel, the kind

of Marxist surplus extraction model.

We showed a little bit today about how the effects

of mortality were not, uh, the same, uh, between the

upper and lower classes.

So, you know, Malthus says it's determined by the relationship

of population and resources.

Right?

Well, we'll talk about next week is another argument that

says that doesn't matter.

It's a secondary, maybe even a tertiary issue.

What actually matters is how much, uh, surplus elites are

extracting, um, from non-athletes.

All right.

Thank you.

Let's.

See?

Finally.

So I hope to see you.

No one's.

Going back.

I'm not coming back.

Don't you.

See that?

Uh, yeah.

Uh, because we only released lecture recordings at the end

of every turn.

So you'll have them for revision.

But we want all of you to be coming to

class during the term.

Black Friday.

I am.

From the second and last, I hear it.

Thank you.

It's been a long night.

In February I had yesterday.

I would love to go again.

And you can buy a coffee past two every day.

And.

I know there are some people who can't have anything

like.

That for Christmas it's like 7:00.

Send me a phone number, like five minutes.

Like they told me about the person.

What did they say?

It was more generic, so.

I'm like, well, do you know what I'm wanting to

know?

And the stupid thing is, they send me the email

saying, fix the problem.

So I spent one day prepping for fixing.

What did you apply for?

Fixed income.

Oh, that's why I.

So what do you see in commodities?

So commodities are just replacing the generic stuff about Iran

and oil.

Oh really?

I didn't like another one, but now I'm betting on

them too.

Look, I.

Know they don't have anything like.

That.

The thing is, how much of the.

Thanks.

So much for.

Lecture 3:

I found the whole time as well.

Just like you wasted my money.

Just start going on.

Wait, but what was his justification for coming in so

late?

He just lost track of time.

Yes.

Yes, yes.

That's so good.

Yeah, I guess.

Wait, so what did he do in, like, ten minutes

of time?

Oh, we just wanted to.

See, the movie just went.

Through, like, five slides.

He had it.

So he was like, I gotta go.

To be fair, I can understand the sentiment.

Oh, hello.

Yeah, I would be best to come.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

Just now.

Yeah, I did, yeah.

I saw you around.

The.

Way.

Oh, right.

Right.

I just.

Want you to trust That.

Took me so long.

Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah.

It's like a bit like.

Oh it's the first time I'm sweating you.

Can't imagine this guy.

Basically there'll be a documentary to.

Show you interact through slides.

So that's kind of why.

He even apologise to somebody else.

You might also be like, I'm not like, I think

I've seen those movies.

They went and they're like, unspeakable.

Oh my God.

Are you.

Oh yeah.

Wait, I.

He's not.

Sure.

I'm sure.

That's.

Not like asking for that.

I mean, I.

Guess that's just that.

I think that goes by that.

We just got five lectures.

Yeah.

So, like.

We go to the left hand side, and I want

to make my left.

After 20 minutes, you go to the.

I just came up here, I found my wrist.

He was eating lunch.

I didn't like check.

You know, like I had a good nap.

Like.

But I was like no one.

I wasn't.

Going to be.

Like, what are you doing?

Oh, you mean.

Oh, I really can't even get up there.

I'm like, oh, my.

God.

You know.

But I think that was that was.

Just, you go.

I know, but we decided to.

Come.

Like I told you.

That's interesting.

Like, what are you going.

To.

Where were you before?

You know how?

Many times.

Everyone left by then.

So we.

Might actually get there.

We'll go together.

It's.

Like she could not.

Thank you.

Thank you.

For.

The magnificent seven ring ring.

It's 7 a.m..

Move it down to go.

Get cold water in the face.

Brings you back to this awful place.

Now go Murphys and your bankers to get out of

those rooms.

Wait a minute.

The crazy chief once said something worse.

I am referring to turning out that bully.

Look at you.

I fight against you.

Out!

But how long.

Can you keep it.

Up?

Give me Honda.

Give me Sonic so cheap.

And But before they hung up on me and said.

Miss Townsend, ask.

Him, okay, what do you do?

What do you what do you do?

Do you know what you're looking for?

Right?

But it might.

Not be the sophistication.

Genius.

Cause my fellow work for us.

Never mind that.

It's time we got to work.

No one of us must go slow in the place

of work.

But it's dragging the hours.

Just.

Wait for by to the bus stop.

This is lovely.

But anyway.

The lunch bell rang.

Take one out to your.

Fine.

What's the reason?

Why do we have more entertainment content.

On the page?

Now the news has left to it that you can

rely on.

The Italian mobster.

The lobster seafood restaurant gets out of hand.

Can't bring a friend to the car like.

Cowboys and TV.

Thank you.

Anybody know this one?

You know what?

Oh my God.

Take my hand.

I reward you extra.

Points, but, uh, you get all the kudos from the

crowd.

Underrated.

But also, perhaps I could sweat some more for someone

so you can get out the door.

It's no good.

Um, trying to find a song about.

Idealism and.

People's social structure was a bit of a challenge.

Uh, but this one name dropped both Marx and Engels,

so I thought it was a clear winner.

Um, still waiting for any of you to contribute to

our song of the week, so please do your ideas.

Uh, all right, so we talked last week about the

relationship between population and resources.

Right.

Uh, we contrasted this with what we discussed the week

before that.

We.

Played primacy to exogenous factors.

Right.

Things that happen outside weather, climate comments, all that stuff.

Then we said, well, actually, maybe it's more endogenous.

The relationship between the number of people and the ability

they have to support themselves is clearly important, right?

This is a population resources model.

Um, one of the main, you know, uh, this Malthusian

model is one of the main kind of explanatory lenses

that, uh, economic historians use.

We're going to introduce another one today.

Another supermodel.

Right.

And people do not live in both worlds.

Very hard to be a malthusian.

Ist.

And simultaneously be a Marxist.

Um, although I am maybe trying to be the first

person to kind of, uh, walk that, uh, tightrope.

Um, but what we are going to see here is

another theoretical model, and I think I'm putting words in

people's mouths here, but the idea is that people who

look at class relations call them Marxists, um, we'll say,

look, it's more complicated than just the number of people.

We need to actually think about how all of those

people organise themselves.

Uh, and how that works.

The organisation of the people into a society is more

important than their raw numbers and the amount of food

they can produce.

All right.

Um, so before we get into that debate, which, uh,

will end our lecture on, and then you'll have your

class next week, having read, um, more about this and

have some fruitful discussion.

We need to talk about how medieval society was organised.

Right.

So we'll talk about this feudal system, um, its logic

and then the relationship between feudalism and another jargony term

called materialism.

Right.

So who has heard of the term feudal before?

Hands up some of us.

So what do we think feudalism is?

How do you describe it?

Um, it's a system that divides society into different groups.

Yes.

Which are, uh, groups.

All the ones that don't.

Possess and.

Have to pay the possessor.

Absolutely.

So you have kind of the haves and the have

nots.

The have nots work for the haves.

That's a pretty good starting place.

Before we get there, we have to understand or try

to understand how medieval people conceived the natural order of

things, um, themselves.

Right?

I told you this before.

I'm telling you it again.

Um.

There was no such thing as an agnostic person in

medieval Europe, right?

Everybody was a believer.

Even the heretics believed in something.

Um, and contemporary medieval people basically thought the society was

comprised of three parts.

Right?

Can anybody tell me what these three parts are?

Anybody read Latin?

If you can read Latin, then you'll know exactly what

I'm talking about here.

What do we see here?

Let's start at the top, right.

The halo is a bit of a giveaway.

Jesus.

Jesus.

God, right.

This would have been to the Monarch Museum in Barcelona.

We'll put that on.

That's the thing to do.

Fantastic exhibit of Romanesque art.

But you always see the guy with the thing, right?

Like some looks, mundi.

Right?

I am the light of the world.

That's this guy.

That's God.

Uh, what are these people doing?

What it look like they're doing.

Or.

Toiling?

Uh, what does this guy look like?

Sorry.

Yeah, yeah, he's doing that for sure.

The pointy hat is a bit of a giveaway, right?

People praying.

We've got people fighting, right?

So the Like.

Hierarchy.

First estate orators, people who pray.

These are the clergy, say, those who fight.

These are the nobility.

These are the knights.

These are the halves that you were talking about.

Top of the feudal hierarchy.

And then you have the third estate that portrays those

who work.

We'll call those the peasants.

Right?

The peasantry are doing this kind of stuff.

Um, the first estates, I mean, they obviously had to

work as well.

Uh, prayer was not entirely, uh, without its labour.

I'm kind of like a retired Catholic myself.

Um, but even if I wouldn't be very impressed with

having to wake up at, uh, you know, middle of

the night to go pray, but that's what these guys

did.

Um, and, uh, you mean my medieval colleagues often have

debates?

Um, this is what lies in wait for you.

If you choose a career in medieval history of how

we would survive if we were time travelled back to

the medieval period.

Right.

And I think my strategy is I need to get

myself to the nearest monastery very quickly.

Um, but then I'd have to kind of get comfortable

with this lifestyle.

Uh, anyway, then you have the second estate, right?

Those who fight these are probably the people that come

to mind most frequently when people think about the Middle

Ages.

We've got the nights, we've got battles, all of that

stuff.

Right.

So that is how medieval people thought the natural order

of the world was.

Obviously not everybody fits neatly.

So we have to add scholars and intellectuals.

They go into the First Estate, largely because universities exist

to teach, uh, members of the clergy, urban nobility.

Right?

They fit in with the knights.

Merchants, um, are a bit harder to classify.

They probably fit in the Third Estate as well.

Um, So lots of contemporary medieval, uh, you know, cultural

artefacts like these pieces of art demonstrate that this was

this isn't something that modern scholars have dreamed up as

a paradigm and imposed on the past.

This is what medieval people thought, uh, how things should

be organised.

Right?

Okay, so we have that, but then we have this

feudalism thing.

Well, the first thing we have to, you know, remember

about medieval Europe, especially after the western half of the

Roman Empire falls.

Right?

Uh, does anybody know why I keep saying the western

half of the Roman Empire fell?

Anybody know what happened to the eastern half of the

Roman Empire?

Yes.

I.

Mean.

Yeah, it carries out this Byzantium basically.

Right.

So when people say Rome fell, it's only the western

part, but very, very broad strokes here, very broad strokes.

The western half of the Roman Empire collapses, right?

Kind of, you know, 300, 400, 500.

That period of time, Western Europe descends into anarchy, right?

There's no cohesive ruling structure.

There's a bunch of clans fighting with each other, constantly

trying, frequently succeeding to expand their territory, succeeding for a

time.

What that means for the kind of median medieval person

is that life is unpredictable and it's very, very violent.

You might be living in your village, and this is

where, like, Hollywood probably gets it right in some way.

You're living with a constant fear of some marauding army

coming through your village, burning into the ground.

Right?

There's obviously isn't a contemporary illustration.

Um, but this one is right.

It's a very chaotic, uh, anarchic, if that's even a

word.

Place.

Right.

So.

Institutional economic history is one another Nobel Prize this past

week.

These are the rules of the game, right?

What do we need?

We need an institutional solution to solve the rules of

the game and the rules of the game.

What medieval European is create is feudalism.

It's a solution to a problem, right?

It's a solution to a problem.

The demise of the Roman Empire created anarchy.

These societies, these people, they need to find a solution.

What they create is feudalism.

This is another way to demonstrate that anarchy.

Right?

Um, this is the ninth and 10th century you can

see.

Right, uh, coming out of modern Hungary, having quite a

lot of success in central, southern and even into Western

Europe.

The Vikings, of course, are familiar with most of this

country was settled by Vikings.

Right.

But they actually get all the way down into Portugal

and Spain, places like that.

Uh, Saracens coming out of, uh, Northern Africa.

They have quite a bit of success, right?

Constant, um, warfare by these little mini empires that are

trying to establish themselves in the vacuum that the Romans

have left.

Uh, going a bit earlier, back in the time.

Probably should have put this one first.

We have the Franks, right?

Charlemagne.

Um, really successful in establishing, uh, his own little empire

for a time.

But that required quite a lot of conquest as well.

Right?

So people need protection For all of this violence.

Anybody who's been travelling around Europe.

Um, if you haven't been to Croatia, it's fantastic.

Uh, but walled cities, right?

You don't have to go very far to see walled

towns.

Walled cities.

Uh.

You know, if that town existed in the eighth, ninth

or 10th century, you can be pretty confident that the

walls existed to, uh, protect people from these violent incursions.

There's some, you know, exceptions to this rule.

It might be in Norwich.

There's an East Anglia two hours east of here.

Uh, East Anglia didn't experience, you know, in, um, you

know, any violent incursions?

Maybe the odd Viking raid.

Like centuries ago, those city walls in Norwich are probably

for the prestige of a wealthy, uh, city.

But often, you know, they that here in France, they're

probably not so worried here when they're building these walls

about Vikings or Saracens or Magyars.

They're probably more worried about French Catholics because obviously Carcassonne

is the home of a famous heretical group in France.

Call me.

Any ideas?

Yeah.

Sorry.

Um, I'm not familiar with that one.

Who am I thinking of?

Greg castles.

The Cathars.

Right.

This is the, uh, Albert al Justinian crusade.

Anyway, you're in England.

Two hours north of here.

Fantastic city walls.

Uh, anyway, so that's one thing that comes out of

it.

The other thing that comes out of it is this

social structure of feudalism.

Right?

Uh, so to lay this on top, uh, with some

economic theory.

Right.

In this state of anarchy.

Right.

The rules of the game are anarchy.

The only people who can exercise property rights are those

who can claim them.

Do you want to condense this into something you can

remember easily?

This is like the might equals rights uh, thing, right?

It's playground politics.

Um, so, uh, what you need here to defend these

property rights?

What are property rights to something that allows you to

exclude others from goods or services?

Maybe exchange these goods or services later once you can

exclude others, right?

So basically, in game theory, a powerful actor can improve

their position if they both respect and protect the property

rights of others.

So what they do is they draw up these protection

contracts, right?

Uh, which, you know, you might think about, you know,

some kind of, uh, playground alliance, right?

Uh, if you're very small and you have another friend

who's small, maybe you make an alliance to stand up

against the big bully.

This is what happens, right?

So all of these.

People from the most powerful kings down to the humblest

peasant in this theory of feudalism, are in some kind

of protection arrangement, right?

They need protection.

Drawing up, uh, a contract to exchange something, uh, for

protection with somebody else above them.

Right.

Now, this gets a bit complicated, but what needs to

come out of here is that nobody has a monopoly

of force in this system, right?

It's very, very fragmented.

So the feudal system that I'm describing in medieval Europe,

in the context of medieval Europe.

Uh, you could have powerful feudal lords who hold a

lot of property, but it is not the state, right?

Stakes are something that come later.

We'll deal with them later in the course.

What is the defining characteristic of a state defined characteristic

of a state?

Is somebody that has a monopoly of violence.

It does not exist in a feudal environment.

Right?

Um, so these people, these, you know, need soldiers in

order to fight, right?

Uh, so how do they get these soldiers?

Well, you get this hierarchy starting to form, right?

Like I said, this is an institutional solution to the

problem of anarchy.

Uh, you have, um, you know, this three orders of

society.

These are these second estate, these organising themselves.

Right?

This feudal system is driven primarily by that second estate.

So you have at the top a king.

This king believes, right?

And everybody under him more or less also believes he

has been ordained by God.

It's a queen.

It's.

She has been ordained by God.

Chosen to rule.

Right?

Whatever that kingdom might be.

Um.

Underneath the king, he has some friends who probably helped

him fight to overturn the left king.

Maybe if you didn't inherit it.

Uh, so the king said, look, I'll make you a

baron.

I'll make you a noble.

If you come and fight for me.

They have a little deal.

Uh, the Baron, in turn, has arrangements with a lower

layer of this aristocracy saying, hey, I need soldiers to

fight for the king.

So I'll give you some of my land that I've

received from the king.

If you come and fight for me.

And it goes on and on and on, kind of

spiralling out from there.

In terms to define if you encounter in the, uh,

feet, five feet, um, or the right this is the

property, um, that a vessel, you know, take from a

lord.

The underling takes on an overlay in order to cement

allegiance.

I'm getting some property from you, which I can use

to derive wealth in order for my pledge to you

to fight when you call upon me.

Also cemented by your homage, right?

This is an oath, usually militarily, when the Lord needs

it.

But this is like what?

What do they say in Game of Thrones?

Bend the knee.

Right.

That's what this is, bending the knee.

Um, it's a performative oath.

And I mean, if you read about the Hundred Years

War, right?

You know, these, uh, all of these things that become

so insulting when the king of France says, look, You

know, Henry, I want you to come from England.

I want you to come to France.

I want you to, uh, you know, bend the knee.

Essentially.

That's what this is.

Uh, so this is how the relationship, the contract gets

sealed, right?

Um, important to remember that Lawrence can have multiple vassals.

It's not an exclusive relationship.

Um, vassals, in turn, have their own vassals.

Right.

Um.

So the case study here that I think explains this

really well, it shows you, you know, just how complicated

this can become.

Um, is.

You have William the Conqueror, but he wasn't always William

the Conqueror.

Right.

1035.

He inherits peacefully, uh, part of France, uh, the Duchy

of Normandy.

He becomes the Duke of Normandy.

And he rules this a little bit of France.

Nice part of France.

Uh.

Now in this feudal world, Quixote's lands from the king

of France, exactly two of them in his lifetime.

Henry the first, Philip the first.

Right.

So he's the underling, right?

He's the Duke.

He holds his land, the King of France, in exchange

for the chance to go and fight for the King

of France.

When the King of France tells him to.

Uh, but I guess it's a bit bored living in

Normandy.

Not much to do.

Um, so.

So he decides to invade England, and he's successful in

doing that.

He mobilises, you know, some of his aristocratic friends.

Loyal knights from Normandy.

They sail to England, and in 1066, they defeat Harold

Godwinson at the Battle of Hastings.

And then he becomes the king of England.

Right.

So.

And this is what happens to, um.

And.

He divides the recently conquered lands amongst his loyal knights

right in that hierarchy again.

So he's in he's, you know, uh, in the second

layer of the feudal hierarchy in France.

Right?

He owes fealty to the king of France, and he

has knights under him, old fealty to both William and

the King of France, indirectly, um, but he simultaneously the

king of England, where he's the top of the rung.

And these loyal knights, uh, form the second order.

Right.

So it gets very, very complicated.

Everything that's complicated.

Right?

I said before that lords can have multiple vassals.

Well, you can take the lords.

Um, and then this is an example.

Um.

Of Just how complicated these things could be, right?

If you're a vessel that has multiple lords.

Uh, here's this guy saying, look, I'm John, right?

Uh, I owe fealty to my lord, Lady Beatrice and

her son Theobald, who is a count of champagne against

every creature.

Right?

Everybody on earth, living or dead, except, uh, for Andromeda.

Who, uh, this other guy, Joan of Arc and the

count of grandparents.

So I owe fealty, uh, to Beatrice and her son.

Uh, except the except these other three guys.

Now, what happens if one of these three guys go

to war with each other?

Well, now there's another clause, right?

The count of Grand Paris should go to war with

the Countess.

Then I'll be on the, uh, counter grandpa side.

Um, but if the count of grandparent makes war on

the Countess other way around, and he doesn't have adequate

support.

And on and on and on and on and on.

I mean, this is actually really, really entertaining, I think.

But you can just see how intertwined these relationships become.

Right.

Um.

Questions?

Any questions?

Kind of blitzing through this right now.

Okay.

So this is the.

Upper end of society, right?

This is the pointy end, very narrow band of elites

who are basically born to the right parents.

Um, and they're seeing these military contracts.

Uh, but if you want to be able to fulfil

this contract, if you actually want to be able to

go and fight for, uh, your feudal overlord when he

or she calls upon you.

What, you need money to do that, right?

You need to.

They need to provide the war horses weapons.

Those are expensive.

Keep in mind, you're also an aristocrat, right?

Like you have to consume conspicuously.

Um, you know, it's the medieval equivalent of having the

requisite supercar to make laps around Harrods.

Slowly, um, with your friends when you need to.

It's very expensive.

So enter the peasants, right.

That third estate, the laboratory.

Uh, where do they come in?

These lords, these aristocratic knights, have been given land.

Or the permission to use land granted land by their

feudal overlords, uh, in exchange for a pledge of, of

um military service in order to finance aristocratic lifestyles and

that military Obligation.

Uh, they farm that land.

How do they farm that land?

Well, they keep some money for themselves.

And they use peasants to do the work on it.

You're going to encounter the term peasant and the term

tenant, uh, in the literature.

There's a long history of the use of these terms.

We peasant is more of like a class, you know,

kind of semi pejorative.

Um, you know, similar to the Latin rustic.

Uh, rustic.

Um, tenant is a more narrowly defined legal term that

means you are a person.

90% of the time, you know, a non noble for

the Third estate who is farming the land of an

aristocrat, right?

But we can think of them as essentially synonymous.

Is that all right?

Yeah.

Tenant from.

From the Latin.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Tenant?

Uh, from the Latin.

Uh.

10 a.m..

Yeah.

Tenants.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Ten.

Um, the whole plan right now, in exchange for the

land that they hold.

They rent it to the Lord right now, that rent,

uh, pays for two things.

Pays for the land that they're going to farm to

use to provide for themselves, but also for their lord,

um, and for the military protection that they are, at

least in theory, receiving from the Lord.

As we get through from the kind of early Middle

Ages, think 500, Western Rome is just collapsed to the

late Middle Ages.

Think 1400, right?

Wars of the roses, especially in England.

But overall this protection element becomes less and less relevant,

right?

The anarchy tapers off.

Um, and this whole military, uh, necessity of a military

solution to an environment of anarchy is kind of like

the reason that the system exists.

Uh, it's the ultimate cases, like path dependence.

Right?

The system persists.

The original need or the original necessity to create the

system is no longer so relevant, but the system itself

persists.

It becomes more of an economic relationship unless the military.

These peasants remember, this is like 90% of any of

these societies, or a few exceptions in Italy, and later

a few exceptions, maybe in the Low Countries, modern day

Belgium and Netherlands.

Right.

They're paying their aristocratic landlord in a range of services

and payments.

Right?

So they might pay with their work.

They might pay with a share of their own harvest

that would be in-kind paying.

You might pay in money.

You know, these are metal coins.

This is the eventually becomes the predominant method.

That's right.

There's a whole bunch of other things that peasants need

to pay for themselves, right?

If you read about fines in the leading theory literature,

when we think about a fine, we think about a

punitive payment.

You parked your car in the wrong place without permission,

and now you have to pay a fine.

Fine in the kind of manorial, uh, feudal context is

usually something, um, to get yourself out of an obligation

or for permission.

Right?

Uh, maybe you're an unfree tenant.

You know, something that resembles what you might understand as

a serve.

The Lord, uh, technically requires, uh, for his permission.

In order for you to make your daughter not to

marry your daughter yourself, but to marry your daughter off

to a third party.

Uh.

Emily.

Um, and so you pay him, like, a fund to

do that.

Or if you want to go live somewhere else, you

pay a fine.

Um.

Tithe, 10% of your income, goes to the church.

Now, taxes paid to the state, the kind of profile

state I did say earlier that the feudal world.

There are no states in this feudal world.

So I should probably put stakes in scare quotes or

out of state or something there.

Um, but basically at the top of this feudal hierarchy,

you still have kings.

What do kings do?

They wage war.

Waging war is expensive.

If they haven't been able to derive enough income from

their peasants paying rent, uh, they basically go and tax

the peasants and say, well, I need to go to

war with France.

I want 1/18 of everybody's.

Uh, well, that's what it looks like anyway.

So there's a range of payments.

So basically, this portfolio of obligations that these third estate,

the peasants at the bottom of this feudal hierarchy, need

to pay forms the crux of this Marxist public relations

model that we're looking at today.

We want to kind of meld these things together.

Here's what it looks like.

You have a Lord.

The Lord has his vassals.

These are the knights.

Second, to state these Bellatrix, who fight to pay for

that fighting.

They all hold these pieces of land which we'll call

manors.

And on the manors live the peasants.

Right.

It gets a little bit more complicated.

Another term you're going to encounter in the readings is

an estate.

I told you about manors.

Manners.

An estate is simply a conglomeration of manners.

They're not always in the same place at the same

time.

Um, especially in England.

So the Bishop of Winchester is one of these feudal

lords, right?

He's from the First Estate.

Right.

He's a clergyman.

Um, but he's also a feudal landlord.

His estate, the Bishopric of Winchester, is comprised of 57

manors in 1301 two.

These matters are distributed across the south of England.

Um.

Each of these manors is divided into two parts.

Right.

The demesne lands.

Right.

This is a kind of Middle French word, uh, for

which we get our domain, which is what the bishop

will use to drive income himself, and he'll farm it

himself in the main drawing over here.

Um, and the rest of it he'll give to his

peasant tenants to farm for themselves in exchange for some

kind of rent.

So the Lord is deriving income from his manor in

two ways manors right by farming it directly or by

charging rents.

Um, I'm drawing broad strokes here.

Uh, Greg's whole PhD is about the management.

Well, of this particular landlord and his domain lands.

Uh, so looks like this, right?

The Lord keeps these yellow strips for himself.

Lets the peasant tenants live on the the white strips

in exchange for rent.

So it looks like this.

Sums up this whole system.

The feudal system.

I think this is the distinction I would like to

draw.

And, Greg, feel free if you want to add a

layer of nuance to this.

If you read feudalism, think great medieval artistic crafts, riding

around on expensive horses and armour, fighting each other, going

to tournaments, all of that stuff, right?

Think, think most of the people you encounter in Game

of Thrones.

You guys watch Game of Thrones or am I dating

myself?

I'm not seeing too many who's watched Game of Thrones

ends up fewer than I would have anticipated.

I thought Game of Thrones was like cutting edge, but

apparently not.

Um, you should go and watch it.

It's fantastic.

Uh, anyway, um.

Yeah, I think knights in our is very few people.

Um, that's the feudal aspect of this.

When you start reading about manners, materialism, forms of labour,

uh, coercion.

Like serfdom, thinking peasants.

It's not really feudalism anymore, because they're so far removed

from the reality is that the aristocrats at the top.

Yes, in theory, they're part of this system.

In order to give the feudal lords, uh, the resources

that they require to provide the safety that the peasants

benefit from themselves.

But because the medieval world is becoming less and less,

uh, crazy, the, you know, need for that protection, um,

especially in England, which after 1066 isn't invaded again successfully.

Uh, it just becomes primarily an economic relationship.

So feudalism is about the elites.

You know, materialism is about the peasants who fund the

elites there.

Yeah.

Just that it has that organisational angle as well.

It's it's how, how how you could organise and make

that system work.

Yeah.

So yeah, this is what starts out as kind of

a military arrangement to provide.

Protection.

Protectionism ends up being something that organises both the society

and the economy.

Right?

This is what we absolutely will encounter in this Marxist

literature is the feudal mode of production.

So now we're getting into the nuts and bolts of

this economic supermodel of class relations.

Okay.

Um.

And I'm drawing very broad strokes here.

You'll discuss this in class.

Uh, but I started this lecture by saying I'm introducing

you to.

Another.

Supermodel.

Right.

You've read something probably from that half term Bailey book,

and they talk about three supermodels.

Uh, the first one is proper.

The first one.

Is population and resources.

We talked about the last week that Malthusian, mechanical kind

of poly relationship.

You have people, they have a need for food.

One increases geometrically, another only increases arithmetically.

So everything about the path an economy takes, whether it

grows, whether it states whatever, whether the people thrive or

not, is based on the relationship mechanical relationship between population

and resources.

That's one model, right?

The Marxist who we're introducing today.

They do not think that the population resources model, uh,

explains, uh, enough.

They think that it's the extractive relationship of these.

Elites.

From, uh, the peasants who work on the land that,

uh, actually is the prime mover that shapes most of

the trajectories of economies.

Right.

So how does this work?

And this comes back.

Sorry.

What's your name?

Okay.

This is what you were talking about earlier.

It's a relationship between the Lords who own the land.

I put that in kind of air.

Quotes.

Um, because they don't actually own the land.

They hold it from the king, but de facto they

own it.

Um, and the peasants who farm it.

Right.

This relationship is inexorably, inescapably conflictual because it is feudal

mode of production, where the lords and the peasants are

engaged in a never ending constant struggle over rent.

Um, put simply, lords, according to this Marxist explanatory model,

will always overburden their peasant tenants with rental obligations.

Right?

These rents could take several forms.

As we've seen, the Lords, according to Marxists, are rent

seekers.

What do I mean by being a rent seeker.

This is an economic theory.

Jargon term.

What's a rent seeker?

Anybody?

Okay, I see a sea of laptops, somebody's Google rent

seeker.

And tell me, put your hand up once you've got

the definition for rent seeking.

This is the term we're going to encounter over and

over again.

Sorry.

What's your name?

Chris.

Okay.

Great.

Seeking.

Seeking is the.

Opposite of growing one's existing wealth by manipulating the social

political environment about creating wealth.

Okay, okay, I could probably strip that down to its

most essential parts.

Um, just say so.

Growing your what?

Growing ones?

Existing wealth.

Growing your existing wealth by manipulating.

The social or political environment without creating new.

Skip that growing your own wealth without creating new wealth.

So the way to think about this is you're a

rent seeker.

You're trying.

To.

Get a bigger share of the pie.

Right.

Everybody's had a pie before.

Um, without increasing the diameter of said pie.

This would be the diameter or the thickness, but without

increasing the size of the pie.

Trying to capture a bigger share.

More for you, less for everybody else.

Right.

Economic hits are trying to seek the origins of economic

growth.

Why do we care about economic growth?

Because economic growth is not all about economic growth makes

the pie bigger.

If you're a red seeker, you're not creating economic growth.

You might even be stopping it or, um, vibrancy.

So this is what Marxist theory they say Lawrence, if

left unchecked, are rent seekers who take a bigger share

of the pie without enlarging the pie, right?

Why is that important for economic growth?

Why will that relationship, that tendency for Lloyd's to exploit,

they call it surplus extraction, right.

Why does that shape the trajectory of economies?

Well, the argument is that they will over extract from

those who do not hold the property.

Those who have to do the work right to the

point where there is not enough left for the peasants

to invest in themselves.

Why does that matter for the overall health of the

economy?

Well, remember that most of the population are peasants, right?

If their rental obligations are so high.

This could manifest itself in a number of ways.

Right?

Let's say they're paying the rent on labour services, but

they're working on their Lord's farm three days a week,

leaving them only two days a week to work on

their own farm.

So their own farm gets neglected.

It doesn't produce as much grain as otherwise could if

they were allowed to spend more of their time on

it, so the local community ultimately produces less grain.

What happens then?

The peasant and his family have less food to eat.

Therefore they're not as healthy.

They're not as strong.

This cycle here, they can't do as much work because

they're small and they're weak and they're not healthy.

So when exogenous things come like the plague, they're more

vulnerable.

The most extreme articulation of this Marxist class structure, one

would say the class structure and the surplus extraction of

elites is more important Then the Black Death as an

exogenous shock, right?

They will acknowledge that the Black Death happened, but they'll

say that it's not as important in determining the direction

of the economy in the society as the extraction of

elites.

And the argument would be that the society was more

vulnerable to the plague because elites had been over extracting

there.

Yeah, that would be the most.

So that is why the class relations model determines the

trajectory of pre-industrial economies, right?

Now, you might see now, um, why, uh, it's very,

very difficult to live simultaneously in a matthewson world and

in a Marxist world, right?

It's probably not impossible, but it's very, very difficult to

live.

Most people choose one or the other, right?

They see the world one way where it's just.

Populating the.

Resources or they see it another way.

Not very many, not very many situations of these two

worldviews being, um, fine.

Uh, but as with most things, you know, will be

sympathetic with elements of both arguments.

Um, and class structure clearly matter, right?

What comes, I think, where the research is going.

Um, and this is what I said earlier, that maybe

I tried to be the first person who could exist

in both worlds.

Uh.

The Marxist arguments, you know.

Well, they come from a highly politicised place, right?

Most of the scholars who articulated this class relations paradigm

started writing after World War Two.

Many of them were, you know, Russians coming out of

the Soviet Union.

Um, you know, they were perhaps guilty of some, um,

uh, what is the term?

Um, I was going to give you another jargon term,

anachronism.

An anachronism.

Right.

Anybody know that term anachronism?

That is when a historian projects the present onto the

past, right?

Am I correct?

Uh, that's what critiques critics of the Marxist system would

say, is that these were people who were clearly influenced

by the mid 20th century milieu of communism, and they

projected those things onto the past.

And what this usually looks.

Like.

Is saying, look, yes, Lawrence had these rights in theory.

And if you actually say if you assume that the

Lords extracted everything that they were, in theory, entitled to,

um, that would be a very high burden on peasants.

What historians coming from other theoretical models have done over

the past several decades.

And this is painstaking work because it involves reading thousands

of medieval manuscripts and trying to count, you know, little

things and add them up.

What these empirical studies have found, uh, in many cases,

is that Lords didn't actually extract as much as they

Marxist would contend that they were theoretically entitled to.

So one example, right?

Marxist might say, hey, the Lord has the right to

confound Everybody who lives on his manor to grind their

grain from grain into flour in order to make bread

at his mill.

The Lord guests in the mill, and everybody is forced

to use it.

It's a monopsony, a monopoly.

Monopoly, right?

Um, yeah.

There's only one printer in LSC.

There's only one printer that you were allowed to use

in this class.

And I own that printer, and I, uh, charge you

$0.10 a page to use my printer.

I'm the Lord in this scenario, right?

Um, that would be how they see it.

Uh.

The reality might be, conversely, that peasants appreciated having the

infrastructure of a mill nearby, and that although lords were

theoretically entitled to find or punish people for not using

their mill, they rarely did.

So it's not necessary.

You know, one view sees it as an opportunity to

extract the other view, conversely, sees it as the provision

of a public good, right?

So that's how this argument has kind of unfolded in

the historiography.

Um, and that's why you have people who will argue

very persuasively in one mode or another.

But our task is critical economic historians is to ask

how strong the evidence is.

Is this overdetermined?

Right.

That's what we are here to do.

And on that note, first paper.

Right.

Uh, upcoming is a book.

Plus.

Article review.

Well, we're going to ask you to be critical of

something that you have read.

Right.

It probably has been very persuasive.

But we want you to try to find, uh, all

the points to critique.

It is due.

November 1st, Friday, 2 p.m..

So the day after Halloween.

Um.

I don't know what your Halloween plans are.

Uh, but.

The reading only 500 words.

You're going to find that that's not that long.

It probably is, uh, informative.

It doesn't count.

But what we want you to do is take your

first step in developing your capacity.

To.

Think critically about these articles, to persuade you.

Physically, to try to.

See through, you know, the facade.

Right?

So there's some points here.

What makes a successful review?

Um, class teachers, we'll talk.

About more.

In class.

The other thing here is that you are going to

mark these with your peers, right.

So we're going.

To give you some insight Into.

The.

Structure and schema that we use to assess your later

essays.

You're going to use that same framework to assess each

other.

The idea for that is that you become very familiar

with what we're going to ask of you, right?

That's the idea.

Anything to add.

Text, whether it's reading something.

Ah yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

And and you know, you're going to have to, uh,

I mean, all of the stuff you've obviously read for

class, so, but you maybe pick the one that you

found most exciting.

Read it closely.

Maybe one.

That's the first essay in about two weeks time, I

guess.

All right.

Thank you.

See you next week.

Page 66 to 1.

Are you interested?

Oh, yeah.

I think it's like this week or something.

You want to do that?

Yeah I will.

Say this.

As well.

I don't know how to say it.

But.

I keep getting paid to lecture.

So.

You No, I've already checked.

That.

Yeah, I've seen the library.

I will take.

A break and then.

I got everything.

Oh, no.

No, I got no problem.

Yes.

Yes, yes.

It's not economics or something.

You know, sometimes I'll be like, okay, what time is

that?

Ask you what?

I need.

I don't know how.

Minute late.

Why?

Huh?

Huh?

Why did you leave him?

I forgot my coat.

Oh, it wasn't my fault.

She got kicked out.

By the bouncer.

So she goes over there, and I was like.

He was like, go get your friend.

Oh, I was like, get her out.

Like she's not into the game.

So I came at like half an hour later when

there was a different event, like 230.

Yes.

Because she was saying I lost you guys.

I didn't find that.

When I couldn't find you, I left.

I was, you know, I left with Christina.

It.

Was Christina.

How was it there?

Oh.

The Russian.

No, not that time.

There's two.

Christina's in our club.

Are you talking about the tiger?

He's very courteous.

Oh, he's in back.

Uh, We're very.

That was Christina.

Oh, yeah.

Why did you like.

Why?

Because she she's she's Gordon as well.

Um, but, yeah, I wouldn't have stayed away.

I almost got an opening in.

The middle of the road.

I mean, what time did you leave?

We left a lot for.

Because I was embedded for.

And you were outside there.

And did Christina come down?

Because.

Because because someone had an American accent.

I swear Christina was downstairs.

Oh, she's your roommate.

Yeah, because Mark was mocking other Christina toolkit.

I don't know, I don't know, I haven't spoken to

him.

I just got up and left.

I think there was a field, but.

So basically, she was moving to summer.

Is that dude?

Who tried to fight?

He was trying to fight.

Oh.

Was he?

Was she interested?

I don't think she was interested.

She's in Situationship.

So I don't know.

She could be.

And then she likes brown guys.

Just.

She walked off in a completely different.

She walked up wet.

Dreadful.

Like.

I don't know why she insisted on walking away from

God and who we ended up at.

I was kind of walking away from that.

She would just get on by herself.

With that.

Thing.

Lecture 4:

Yes yes yes.

Yes.

I feel like I need to do.

Something now.

Hi.

Everyone.

This is essential reading.

You know, I say.

If you're reading this, I think.

I don't want you picking something that I've never heard

of.

For sure, but it doesn't have to mean it's essential.

I would choose something that has an argument.

Yeah, because that's what I was thinking about.

Well, one.

When you're in Bali, for example.

It's very interesting to see, but it's more descriptive.

Yeah.

So um, argument.

So maybe with some original data, Hatcher and Bailey are

telling you what other people are.

But yeah.

This is the easy one.

It's not a new rule.

No.

Um.

I.

Would, I would.

Just let me tell my story.

Yeah.

And I have 200 people.

So this could be the other extreme.

Yeah, yeah.

So I think you you don't mind?

Yeah, yeah.

I have a chair for you right there.

Just like last week.

So why would you do that?

I didn't want to.

Yeah.

So slow down.

It's fine.

Wait.

What is it?

It's.

Not like I don't know.

But I see what they have.

Oh, I see.

How did it go?

It's not good to go in the back.

Because I wanted to take a picture of this.

How do you know?

When the farmer comes to.

Town with his wagon broken down.

Oh, the farmer is the man who feeds them all.

If you'll only look and see, I think you will

agree that the farmer is the man who feeds them

all.

For the farmer is the man.

The farmer is the man.

Lives on credit till the fall.

Then they take him by the hand.

And they lead him from the land.

And the middle man's the one who gets it all.

I know your hangs around.

And the butcher cuts a pound.

Or the farmer is the man who feeds them all.

And the preacher and the cook go strolling by the

brook.

But the farmer is the man who feeds them all.

Oh, the farmer is the man.

The farmer is the man.

Lives on credit till the fall.

For the interest rate so high.

It's a wonder he don't die.

So the mortgage man's the one who gets it on.

When the banker says he's broke and the merchants up

in smoke, they forget forgets the farmer feeds them all.

It would put them to the test.

If the farmer took a rest, then they'd know that

if the farmer.

Feeds and all of a sudden.

The farmer is the man.

The farmer is the man who's on credit till the

fall.

Whenever, whenever.

You and his pants are wearing things, his condition.

It's a sin.

He's picked up and he's the.

Man who feeds it.

I used to be the guy.

Because it took me, like an hour or two.

Heard that one before.

Is that a hand up?

For sure?

Oh, actually.

Oh, wow.

Fantastic.

You're on a roll here.

Quick is going to be.

More difficult.

Though.

Um, So this week is about the importance of agriculture,

right?

The song, uh, from an album about industrial ballads, bucked

the trend, but also about the importance of farmers.

So where are we so far?

Uh, we have talked about Malthus.

Well, first, we actually started by kind of teasing this

models, uh, which in some ways, you know, maybe should

have come later.

But we started by thinking.

About.

What if the environment determines everything, right?

And then we moved into population resources, Malthusian models, which

is like, well, maybe it's not so much the environment

or the climate as it is just the mechanical relationship

between population and Resources.

And then last week he said, well, perhaps a little

bit crass to think about population as one homogenous entity.

Obviously there are hierarchies in that population.

There's inequality and there's dynamics within that population that are

happening.

And that's that Marxist model that's looking at social dynamics,

right.

And we're trying to decide, uh, what, you know, model

explains most of the variation that we see or the

trajectories of, uh, the medieval economy.

Right.

Well, now I'm going to kind of step aside a

little bit from one of these orthodox models.

Uh, if there is a theoretical undercurrent for today's lecture,

it's probably technological determinism.

We'll talk about that in a bit.

Um, the point I want to reinforce is last week

we talked about.

Social.

Structure, feudalism, serfdom, manorial isms.

And there's a reciprocal relationship between the social structure and

the form and structure of the agricultural system and its

reciprocal society.

The social structure informs the way that agriculture is organised.

The organisation of agriculture shapes or reinforces the social structure.

So there's something going on there.

Um, yeah.

Why, uh, do I want to talk about agriculture?

Here's that parallel I said last week.

This is the structure, uh, the characteristics of medieval society.

It's also the defining characteristics of medieval agriculture.

Right.

We cannot lose sight of the fact that in the

entirety of the period we cover.

Agriculture is the dominant sector, right?

In the medieval period, in most places it's like 90%

of the population.

Um, of course, Italian city states and the urban areas

in the Low Countries might buck that trend.

But there are exceptions to the rule, right?

Most people work in agriculture.

Why is that?

Well, because the kind of per capita productivity of agriculture

is so low relative to more contemporary periods, that we

need most of the labour force in agriculture in order

to feed the entire population.

If you want some theory to underpin this, a good

way to look at it is the Louis model, right,

which is a two system economy.

Uh, assume we have an agricultural Cultural sector and manufacturing

sector.

One of the things I mean, if you haven't heard

it in 101, you'll be 101 soon.

Uh, is that with economic growth, you get structural change,

right?

They're very, very highly correlated.

The causation is perhaps less clear, but as economies develop,

the labour force increasingly shifts out of the agricultural sector

and into the manufacturing sector.

Primary sector.

Secondary sector.

As growth continues, we shift out of the manufacturing sector

and into the tertiary sector, which is services.

Most of us are going to end up working in

services, right.

Um, and then there's, you know, in some paradigms, even

the fourth sector.

Uh, but what I want to demonstrate and later on

in the course, we're going to start talking about the

shift of to manufacturing in the pre-industrial world.

This is a higher productivity sector, right?

It's a key to unlocking economic growth.

If you can boost your manufacturing sector because it's more

productive than agriculture.

And but in order for you to experience the sectoral

shift into the manufacturing sector and reap the economic growth

that it brings, your agriculture has to become increasingly productive

as well, because you need labourers to be released from

the agricultural sector to then work in the manufacturing sector.

If you're taking labour away from the agricultural sector, it

has to become more productive, right?

You need to be able to produce at least the

same amount of food with fewer labourers.

In order for those labourers to move into manufacturing and

bring your economy economic growth.

Right.

So through this Lewis model, right?

Agricultural sector is characterised by low wages and an abundance

of labour and very labour intensive production process right manufacturing

characterised by higher wages and higher productivity.

Obviously there's capital involved in manufacturing.

Um, and the Lewis model also assumes that marginal productivity

isn't really a thing in agriculture.

Right?

Uh, now the cultural sector is also assumed to have

a limited amount of land.

Malthus assumed this as well.

Right.

Um, also assume that the marginal product of an additional

farmer was zero because of diminishing returns, right?

The model assumes that you can't increase productivity.

And I want you to think keep this in the

back of your mind as we progress through this.

You won't be examined on the Lewis model, right?

This is just a useful theoretical paradigm to think through

what we're going to talk about.

So this The economy develops, you might move from what

you would characterise, uh, as a traditional economy where, you

know, most of the people are working in agriculture, right?

For much of our period, in many of the places,

the proportion of agricultural labour would have even been higher

than this.

And then you might think of a, well, a secondary

manufacturing economy or a transitionary economy has fewer people in

agriculture, more people in services, in manufacturing.

And then the tertiary world where we all live has

few people in agriculture, most people in services.

Right.

This is the world where we live in, in most

like G7 countries today, right?

What we cannot lose sight of is that for this

to happen, the agricultural sector has to increase its productivity

significantly.

You have to do the same amount to create the

same amount of food with 10% of the workforce, as

you had done previously, with 70% of the workforce.

And the it's probably even more than that, because if

you think about England as a case study, right, this

is a if we think about medieval England, even before

the Black Death, the population of like 5 million, right.

The population has increased significantly in that period.

So you have it's even the effect is even greater.

So you can never escape agriculture.

Now, I've shown you a number of graphs like these

kind of hockey stick curves.

Sometimes their GDP, sometimes their population.

Um, and if I was to graph the productivity of

agriculture, it would look similar.

Um, so a cow, 100 gallons of milk in 1270,

by 1750, that had increased by three times.

Right.

That's a significant amount today.

It's like almost an order of magnitude from what it

was the 1750s.

Right.

So, um, this is a very, very significant change.

But the point I want to, you know, the same

thing would be true for beef.

But what I want to draw your attention to, this

isn't a graph, but you might visualise one in your

head is that even though relative to more modern times,

the product of agriculture was low, right?

Especially if you compare it to today.

There's still significant change going on, right?

So if you zoom in to pre 1800 or 101

star 1870 or something for some reason, um, right.

There's still significant productivity increases.

Right?

So although levels are low relative to the modern era,

we do get significant agricultural productivity increases in the Middle

Ages and Early modern period.

Okay.

Any questions?

All right.

So we talked about this last week again.

Right.

The structure society is basically the structure of, uh, agriculture.

Right.

Um, you have these aristocratic elites who hold their land.

So some kind of head lord, typically a monarch in

exchange for military service.

Military service is expensive.

They need to make money.

So they make money from the lands they've been given.

Do that by farming part of their lands themselves and

renting out other parts to peasants.

And it's peasants who do most of the work.

And the theory goes that the peasants receive both economic

and military security, uh, through their tendency from their lord.

Most of these matters places are divided into three parts.

And this is going to become really, really important because

this kind of tripartite division, the holy trinity of medieval

agriculture, changes in a very short amount of time.

Right.

So you have the demean.

That's what the Lord derives income from himself.

However he might do that the peasants who provide for

themselves and their families.

Um, and then there's that third component, common land, which

everybody in the community, lords and peasants alike, have access

to and derive some kind of income from.

Again, this is from last week, but peasants pay for

their land with rent in a variety of ways, sometimes

labour, sometimes a share of the harvest.

I mean, this reinforces how important agriculture is when the

agriculture, agricultural labour and agricultural produce are often, you know,

the main commodities of exchange.

So this is what the bishopric of Winchester looks like.

He has 57 manors and 1301.

And they're comprised of these three parts.

Um, this is also the Bishop of Winchester's estate.

But in 1208, when he only had 27 manors.

Uh, the best map I could find.

Um, but the point is, they're distributed around the country,

right?

The manors are distributed around southern England.

They're not all in one place.

And then each of those manors is going to look

something like this.

Right.

Each of those dots on the map looks like this.

You have the mean land, you have tenant land.

And it's organised in these strips, scattered about.

And then you have the common land which everybody has

access to here.

Right.

More on this in a minute when you get into

your readings.

You know, starting this week and next week.

Um, there's a lot of discussion.

About this unit that we use called a manor.

Right.

What is a manor, exactly?

A manor is like a function of this feudal seniority

system, right?

It's the lands governed by a single lord.

But sometimes a manor is a village.

Right.

That's very straightforward.

Other times the manor might contain several villages.

Um.

And one village might contain several manors or be part

of several matters.

You don't have to worry about this.

This isn't really, um, a major point, that it gets

messy if you encounter it in your readings.

Uh, don't worry about it too much, okay?

Uh, and we saw the strange system, right, of communal

land distribution.

One of the main puzzles for today is to figure

out.

And.

And next week when you discuss it in seminar, is

why medieval manners are organised in such a way.

Right?

Why do they do this?

Because this organisation is very much a function of feudal

society, right?

It also shapes how the economy is going to evolve.

Um, why are they stripped of land?

Well, what I'm going to tell you next is that

it's all about the importance of animals, right?

Um, we'll come back to this in a second.

These lands need to be piled with animals, right?

And you might if you're ploughing your strip, you might

be able to plough your neighbours as well.

Lots of people pay rent with ploughing services.

So the Lord will say.

No peasant, you can plough your strip and plough mine

as well.

And actually works the other way as well.

On some manners it's customary, especially in Sussex, for some

reason, for the Lord to plough the peasants land for

a certain number of days.

This is one explanation, and it kind of foreshadows the

importance of animals.

Now, as we move from kind of high Middle Ages

to the late Middle Ages and certainly into the early

modern period.

What we'll see again and again.

It's kind of a stylised fact that we think what

happens is that the economic gravity, medieval Europe shifts from

the southern Europe, Mediterranean area, kind of, you know, what

remains of Rome after collapsed in about the year 500

Western Roman Empire.

It shifts to north western Europe.

The England experiences the industrial revolution.

First, there's the Dutch Golden Age, right in 1750.

That North Sea area is the most vibrant parts of

medieval Europe, right?

The economic epicentre moves from the Mediterranean to the North

Sea area.

Um, how does that happen?

Why does that happen?

Um, well, a lot of it has to do with

developments in agriculture, right?

Remember that, you know, even the manufacturing and service sectors

are more productive.

If you were, like able to see in the future

you want to plan an economy like that's what you

want to do.

You want to get your manufacturing and services sectors as

productive up and running as possible, right?

Um, to do that, you need productivity in agriculture.

In the Mediterranean.

The Romans had farmed in a certain way.

There was a portfolio of Roman agricultural technologies, and that

is all that anybody knew.

Right?

But there's some fundamental differences between the Mediterranean and the

North Sea area.

So first of all, it's hot and dry, right?

Only really rains in the winter.

Um, which is why everybody loves to visit Italy, Right.

And why nobody wants to come to London in the

winter.

Um, but what this means is that there's insufficient rainfall

to grow multiple crops a year.

Right.

So only 50% of the land at any given time

in this Roman model of agriculture, the ancient Mediterranean dry

farming, only 50% of your land can be used, right?

So remember that all of these models, the Malthusian model,

the Lewis model, they say land is fixed.

Right.

But you could only use 50% of it.

So, you know, I have two squares, but actually I

can only productively use one in any given year.

What you get, let's say, from this, you know, seventh

century onward.

Catalysed by a series of innovations that you'll read about

in the seminar are a series of technological innovations that

unlock the keys to farming in the North Sea area,

northwestern Europe.

So these are wet, heavy clay soils, right?

Lots and lots of rainfall.

Um.

You can't farm these lands with the portfolio of technologies

that the Romans had.

So you got a series of innovations that starts to

allow farming in northern Europe to take advantage of perhaps

superior climactic, uh, geographic resource endowments.

This is the Jared Diamond idea.

Jared Diamond is saying, well, you know, north western Europe

went on to conquer the world, you know, basically because

they had a better environment.

It takes us all the way back to first week

when we're saying determines everything.

Um, but in order to unlock the kind of inherent

advantages that northwestern Europe had and its agricultural, um, possibilities

needed a series of innovations.

So that basically is the extension of the heavy plough,

uh, the horse collar, um, and the three field rotation.

So before we get to that.

We want to think a little bit more about why

manners were organised in such a weird way.

Right.

I said, um, you know, kind of, uh, foreshadowing what

we're going to talk about next week when we talk

about agricultural technology comprehensively.

Um, they're organised in strips and these strips are scattered

throughout the community.

So first question, why strips seams?

Why long narrow strips?

Why not?

Nice big square.

I mean, I'm from western Canada, right?

Everything is a grid.

Why do you think the land is divided up into

these narrow strips?

Yeah.

For water.

So that's an interesting idea.

That's true.

In some cases, like in Canada where I'm from and

the kind of alluvial regions of Quebec, you get long

and narrow strips.

So everybody has access to water.

Um, and that can be the case.

There's a matter in Suffolk, um, study that Mark Bailey

mentioned once where all the strips seem to be, you

know, in a circular pattern.

And it turns out that there's a kind of natural

spring.

Um, but that's not the main reason why else?

Yeah.

It's easier for cattle to walk straight.

It's easier for cattle to walk straight.

Yes, to some degree.

But where?

I think there's another half to this.

What are the cattle doing?

For walking straight.

Uh, yeah.

Yeah.

So I think it's about communal ploughing, right?

I said the innovation.

We're going to talk more about technology comprehensively next week.

Uh, but one of the major innovations unlocks the possibilities

of farming in north western Europe.

That's a really catalyses all the economic growth is going

to come later.

It all requires ploughing.

You have a team of maybe eight oxen or maybe

six horses.

Right.

It's very, very hard to turn them around.

Right.

Um.

We should.

You can still go to these, like, anthropological museums where

you can plough with oxen or horses.

I think maybe we should do a field trip.

Anybody wants to put on their wellies and go horse

ploughing?

Um, I know, for example, I don't even know that.

Uh, but it's very hard to turn them around.

So this land is like, you know, is, uh, shapes

the landscape because everything is organised around the necessity to

use these animal ploughs, um, in this long, narrow way,

which is different from how the Romans used it, because

they're only used a light plough that just scratches on

the surface, and they go crisscross here.

Um, because we need more animals, we need to pull

in these long, narrow strips.

Now, again, like I'm from the New World.

So those of you who are from the Old World,

perhaps, um, are used to seeing ancient things, but this

totally blows my mind.

This is what That looks like in real life this

region for us.

Has anybody seen Ridge and Furrow before?

Hands up.

Yeah.

Where?

Where have you seen it from?

Yorkshire.

Exactly.

You're from Yorkshire?

Who else has seen it?

Hands up.

I saw some hands over here.

So basically you can still see this Yorkshire if you

take the train to Bristol and wherever that goes, you

can look up the train window and see it.

And this is like the medieval landscape, right?

This is the medieval landscape plough with a heavy plough

creating this ridge and furrow system.

Right.

Maybe these were the Lord strips and these were like

Joe peasants or whatever, but that just blows my mind.

You can see this today.

Um, so there's another couple of things we need to

think about.

They organise them into strips.

Right.

Uh, use transit animals more efficiently.

Um, but wireless strips scattered.

Anybody with eagle eyes might have just seen.

I went too far on the flights.

But why are the strips scattered?

Why are the Lord's strips not all here?

And Joe peasant strips, not all here.

And the local church strips?

Not all here.

Why are the strips scattered?

Yeah.

So you have to do with, like, control one, one

of like, if you have lots of strips from a

very large land and you can the peasants can kind

of emancipate themselves.

Almost.

Okay.

That's interesting.

Um.

I think where you're going in terms of the diversification

or spread, uh, idea is correct.

Um, a wealthy peasant could acquire more strips.

Um, so I think we're part of the way there.

Yeah, I see something to do.

With each of the different cases.

I mean, like different soils and stuff.

So it'd be like different areas growing different things.

Yeah.

That's also.

Some.

Innovation.

So that way everyone has kind of perception like good

soil.

Yeah.

So that's a different articulations of the same thing.

This is it basically right.

This is a diversification strategy.

So let's say this is more fertile here.

Uh what it means is that everybody has some of

their strips in that fertile land, maybe over here near

the waist.

This would be marginal land.

So these strips probably aren't very good, right?

Everybody has to take a share of those.

Um, also, you know, if this pond floods every five

years, you know, everybody is exposed to that risk.

And it's not just, you know, uh, Joe Peasant who's

getting his crops flooded every year.

Right?

So it's a system of both risk diversification and kind

of a regulatory and, um, spread of, uh, differences in

soil types, fertility and exposure to risk.

Do you want to come in here and say anything?

I think the diversification arguably benefits both.

Both.

So even the Lord would want something like this application.

Yeah.

Because there could be things that could affect his people

if he concentrated.

So yeah.

So both ends of the spectrum want diversification and they

get it right.

Um, so, uh, you'll read McCloskey.

Deirdre McCloskey most famously articulated this idea, right?

That this is risk aversion, right, everybody?

Uh, yeah.

They want to take advantage of differences in fertility, but

perhaps a stronger motivation is risk aversion, right?

So remember I said that everybody in the, you know,

preindustrial world, uh, except for a select few, I'm working

in agriculture.

The other thing is, is most of these people working

in agriculture are living near the subsistence line, sometimes below.

If there's been some very, very bad year, right, like

the Black Death was, you know, a plague kills people,

Y pestis.

Right.

Uh, but in 13, 15 to 17, you just had

three back to back to back horrible harvests.

And maybe 20 or 30% of the population died then

as well.

Right.

So you have a risk averse mentality.

I'm drawing very broad strokes here.

Um, seeing Greg maybe bristle a bit because his research

has nuance to this.

But we think of this as a do you want

to buy this model?

You know, buy all the way in.

You're dealing with a very risk averse mentality of people

who want to avoid the next catastrophe, but not necessarily,

uh, increased productivity accrue, you know, capital and expand operations.

Right.

Um, so that is social structure of serfdom and materialism,

right?

Remember, that was a society that responded to a need

to protect itself from the anarchy prevailed in the early

medieval period, and then, even after those dangers had a

kind of faded away.

Uh, you know, a second, uh, maintained itself, uh, you

have a different existential threat in a variable climate.

Low productivity agriculture, um, very few opportunities to store, you

know, surplus.

So this is another social response, um, as a function

of the social structure, uh, to hedge against an existential

threat.

Yeah.

You were farming.

Was the communal farming like, would peasants at harvest time

only go and harvest that strip of land, or would

they all harvest together?

Yeah.

Good question.

Um.

I think.

It varies.

From community to community, but to generalise, most of the

community would have been expected to, um, work on the

Lord's land, especially during harvest.

But the Lord also has a higher in external people.

So they're not, you know, they're not simply clearing the

Lord's land until it's done.

And while their own crops rots in the field.

Um, did peasants help each other out in harvest?

I actually don't know.

Uh, there's probably studies and evidence of this.

Do you have any inkling, Greg?

I mean, it's something the sources are typically silent on.

Um.

I would imagine it probably helped.

I mean, people would hire each other as well.

So there was, like, a labour market to functions reasonably

well.

Um, but the communal when we talk about communal here,

we're talking about the nature that everybody's land is mixed

together.

And the bottleneck is that It's very difficult to farm

rationally.

And by rationally I mean however, one individual wants to

do it in this risk reducing kind of social enterprise.

Right.

So this is what's coming next.

There are competing theories.

So it's not like McCloskey is the orthodoxy that we

have to accept.

Darwin has some theories.

It talks about, um, balancing the needs to grow crops

with balancing, uh, pastoral farming, you know, raising animals.

As we discussed, it becomes more important.

Balancing those pieces explains it in some way.

The problem with communal farming and this risk averse attitude,

um, is that it.

Inhibits economic growth.

So the argument goes right.

And one of the reasons is, is that it's very,

very difficult for an entrepreneurial innovator.

What's the term that gets used now?

Disruptor.

Right.

Um, to make any kind of major changes.

Right.

So imagine you're living in this world and Greg says

you've been growing barley.

Um, I feel that it's going to be warm next

year.

You know, my hip has been ageing, so that tells

me it's about to get warm.

And, uh, I've seen the prices.

I think we should for wheat.

Next year is good.

The prices are going to be high.

Right.

Let's sow wheat.

Great catch is so weak on hipsters because.

Right.

Maybe this is the field that typically grows wheat.

And this is the one that grows barley.

Or, you know, it's hard to sow different crops on

these strips.

What can I say?

You know what, Greg?

Like, seriously an idea.

But I grow barley.

My my daddy.

Daddy grew barley on this man.

We grow barley, so get lost.

You know, we're growing barley like we always do.

So Greg's innovation doesn't get to reap the benefits.

Um, that's the conservatism, um, of needing communal consent.

So it's a model that distributes the risk, but perhaps

sacrifices potential productivity gains in this communal enterprise.

Right.

And that's just on the peasant land.

Remember, one third roughly of these strips are owned by

the Lord as well.

Um, and you might think, well, the Lord is the

Lord.

He can do whatever he wants, right?

But he doesn't either, because, remember, these lords have many

manners.

They can't be in every place at once.

Um, and indeed, most of them are off, you know,

doing lordly things either generally either partying or fighting or

something like that.

Right?

They're not farmers.

Um, so what they do is they appoint officers at

every one of their manors, um, to manage their lands

for them.

But it's a bit of a perverse incentive for these

officers, uh, who manage the Lord's land.

Now, you're really getting into Greg's territory here, so you

should throw something at me if I'm getting this wrong.

But basically, the manorial officers are risk averse as well,

because the accounting system is set up in a way

that they have to meet the benchmark.

We grew 100 quarters of barley last year.

Um, therefore, I expect you to grow 100 quarters of

barley this year.

If you do not throw 100 quarters of barley this

year, or you spend too much on labour or two

months on horses in growing 100 quarters of barley that

I expect you to grow.

I am going to penalise you, right?

But I'm a very good farmer.

And prices are high.

Weather is good.

Uh, I'm a very shrewd manager, and I managed to

grow 120 horses, probably, uh, with less labour inputs.

I get to share in the profits.

So the Lord's lambs are being managed in the same

risk averse way, perhaps for slightly different reasons.

One doesn't want to avoid the next catastrophe.

Right.

But they're not trying to increase productivity.

Is that fair?

Do you want to do something?

Or.

Let me just say that there is a there's an

even even times of binding constraint, given the rotation from

fallow to winter sown to spring sown.

So you don't necessarily get the choice between wheat, wheat

or barley because that's you've got a winter and spring

choice.

So it's actually an even an even more constrained choice

than you had.

Good.

We'll talk about the innovation of the three crop rotation

next week.

We'll talk about that.

Uh, um, impinges as well.

Um, so you get this.

Feudalism creates materialism and serfdom.

This in an paradigm of low productivity farming, right?

Um.

Is a barrier to growth.

But the one thing to remember is that even with

this bottleneck, the irrationality of risk averse communal farming is

still higher productivity than what was possible in the South.

Right.

That's important to remember.

Um, but these constraints weren't eased after the Black Death,

kind of in the later 14th, 15th century.

And after that, these bottlenecks were avoided, um, with the

leasing of land and.

The leasing of land and enclosure.

Right.

Uh, so this is this is the Greg Salter slide.

Um, he didn't really angry with me.

If this might be, I might be making it far

too simple.

Um, but.

I remember he said one third of the land is

held by the Lord.

Right?

During this high period when, you know, uh, we've adopted

new technologies that we'll talk about next week, and we've

increased.

We've made farming possible in a way that produces, uh,

high levels of productivity, the lawns, reforming their own lands

for themselves.

Right.

But they start after the Black Death and in some

cases, even before leasing them out.

Um, so basically they're saying, well, instead of growing barley,

selling it, reaping the rewards, I'm going to just rent

this out to somebody, uh, for £3 a year, because

all I want to do is buy nice food, nice

clothes and nice horses.

It's actually too much trouble to manage this, so I'll

leave it out to you for some period of time,

and, uh, I'll get my money.

But what that means, at least theoretically, I'm not sure

if it's been empirically tested yet.

Uh, until Greg's PhD is, um, on flies.

Uh, but the evidence doesn't really exist to test this.

Uh, but the idea would be that if the Lord

leases his land, uh, that principal agent problem I just

talked about, his risk averse manager.

It disappears because Dispenses with his risk averse agent.

He leases his land to Greg, who we know wanted

to grow wheat because he knew the prices were going

to be good.

Now Greg has all of the Lord's land, and perhaps

he can manage it more effectively.

So we've got rid of one constraint, right?

The problem is we're still in the increment intermingled strips.

So now, Greg, still, you know, he might have more

land.

He might be free of this principal agent problem.

Right.

He wants to increase productivity.

He wants to maybe increase its income.

But he still has to argue with me about what

he wants to do.

Um, so we don't have to worry about this.

We'll talk about it next week because I'm running out

of time.

But what we get is this inclusion movement.

So this is what so the argument goes, catalyses this

early modern agricultural revolution the Mark Overton talks about, but

the specifically comes from the work of Art Allen.

So remember we have peasant lands, the mean lands owned

by the Lord.

Right?

Maybe these demesne lands are now, in the 15th century,

starting to be managed by more rational farmers, who probably

came from the peasants themselves or peasants ancestry.

But you still had these common lands, right?

This is going to be a meadow the people use

for grazing their animals, or a woodland where they let

their pigs go to eat acorns and get fat.

Um, collect firewood to burn.

Right.

Everybody had access to them, you know.

Uh, well, what happens is the Lords, you know, they

lease their manors.

Maybe they see that the productivity starts to increase a

bit, uh, when there is more rationally.

But then they start to exercise their property rights, um,

more forcefully.

And basically what they do is they kick the peasants

off of the common land.

You may no longer graze your sheep here.

You may no longer let your pigs eat acorns.

You may no longer collect firewood.

What else do peasants do on common land?

Uh, there's all sorts of customs about.

Like, could you collect the firewood that had naturally fallen

from a strong wind, as opposed to, like, ripping it

out of the tree yourself?

But anyway, the peasants don't have access to this land

anymore.

The Lord plants around it.

The purpose is to extinguish communal rights, right.

And convert these into individual private property rights.

Um, yeah.

So enclosure in the commons is the main one.

Um, they might kick some.

They might take back some of those strips and turn

them into one contiguous farm, or they might expand into

marginal land, although this is, uh, a distant third.

Uh, because the population pressure isn't usually so high.

Um, this happens in East Anglia.

Once you get hydraulic technology to drain the fence.

Um, but what this means is that peasant tenants lose

their access to common land, and sometimes they lose access

to the land that they had previously rented from the

Lord.

But let's just focus on the loss of common access

rights.

There's some debates about this, right?

But why does this enclosure happened when it did?

Well, the argument is generally a demographic one, that population

pressure recedes, although the timing doesn't quite work because enclosure

doesn't start happening into 1460.

It's like a century after the Black Death.

I'm not sure if anybody's really resolved this.

Um, probably this has to do with price levels not

becoming optimal to do this until, uh, later 15th century.

Um, but the most important thing that happens here, and

this is very much drawing on the work of Bob

Allen, is that all of a sudden you get rid

of that constraint, that bottleneck of requiring communal consent to

manage these matters.

All of a sudden, one person has most of the

land.

He or she makes the decisions, right?

It lubricates the land market, exchange of land, and was

possible and had been going on for centuries before this.

But this makes the land market, um, a bit more

liberalised.

Um, I mean, if you want to get used economics

jargon, you might say that this is a capturing of

Ricardian rents, right?

Um, but what this does is if that risk averse,

feudal manorial system of communal agriculture, which was so good

at hedging, you know, the existential risks that everybody faced,

but not very good at raising productivity, this, in aggregate

raises productivity by removing the constraints.

Now, an exogenous person like a Bruce Campbell would probably

also say that the weather, the climate had to improve

in order for this to happen.

So there wasn't so many catastrophic climactic events.

So perhaps the risk hedging became less necessary.

But the idea is this land can be formed in

a more rational way, and that leads to a step

change, another increase in productivity.

So in the long run, you move out of this

Roman farming into the northern European farming takes advantage of

the wet, uh, climate with technology.

We'll talk about next week that increases productivity.

Um, then, uh, after the Black Death in the 15th

century, you extinguished these common rights which had evolved in

order to raise productivity yet again.

What does that do that releases labour out of agriculture

and frees it up to move into the more productive

areas of, uh, manufacturing?

Right.

I don't know why.

My.

Yeah.

Um.

There's another phase of enclosure that happens in the 18th

and 19th centuries, right?

That might be the more historically famous enclosure movement.

Um, but the main difference is, and this is kind

of getting to the end of our period, uh, the

state, so much as you could call it, a state

in the Tudor period, was mostly opposed to enclosure.

The state that has definitively emerged by the 18th and

19th century is very much an advocate of it.

This is another one of those things that is, we're

talking about an aggregate phenomenon.

We're talking about agricultural productivity.

We've reduced it basically, I think.

Think about a graph in your mind of agricultural productivity,

whatever the units might be.

It's increasing.

Behind that line is like a tyranny averages.

Right.

Because More rational farming might have raised aggregate productivity, but

for single individual peasant families, the loss of access to

this common land could have been catastrophic.

Right?

Imagine you had only six acres of land, and that

is, you know, not enough to keep you and your

four children and your wife, um, in food and clothes.

So you've been relying on letting the kids, you know,

uh, out into the local woods.

They eat the acorns.

I mean, pigs eat anything, right?

That's why you should watch the Guy Ritchie movie.

Never trust the man who keeps pigs because they eat

anything.

But anyway, uh, and pigs also have lots of babies,

so it's a very useful animal to keep.

But basically, this pig which lived off of the communal

resources, was providing you with enough food or income in

one way or another to kind of keep your distance.

You know, you lose that.

All of a sudden you and your children are starving,

right?

So tyranny of averages aggregate productivity increases, but with it,

so does inequality.

Um, I'll end there.

Uh, and I'll see you next week for a more

in-depth discussion of agricultural technology.

Thank you.

Hey.

Come on.

So this is what.

I was looking.

For.

You know.

I.

Well.

It's very.

Tough when I say that.

I'm sorry.

I just.

Feel like I was.

I felt like I was.

Hey, you.

I'm not.

Leaving you.

What are you wasting an hour of my life?

Have you seen it?

Actually, no, I don't think.

You don't think?

She said you.

Yeah.

That's it.

How long did he spend on that?

How did I.

Not talk about that?

You know, I'm just really.

Not doing it.

Yeah.

No, it's like you don't tell your girls.

I'm like, I'm so sorry.

Like I was gonna be poisoning.

Oh, I.

You got that long.

Somebody you got to walk.

I said.

Nobody here work for me.

He got what I said.

The last 24 hours.

She was silent.

No, no, no.

All right.

Let's get started.

Um, I did ask, uh, about a different room.

Um, and the only other option, uh, is equally, if

not more suboptimal than this one.

So, uh, we're just going to persevere with this room,

uh, for a few weeks remaining after reading week.

And, uh, then we're going to move to a nice

new one next term.

So, uh, last week, uh, I started off by talking

about the inescapable importance of agriculture.

Right.

We forget about agriculture in the modern day.

Uh, and it's important to the vitality of any economy

in society.

Uh, and that's increasingly true the more you go back

in time.

Right?

Uh, plug my guy in.

Um, right.

Because the first day we go back in time, the

lower productivity agriculture is and more people tied to the

land in order just to earn subsistence incomes for all

of society to earn a subsistence income.

But even once you get sectoral shift, uh, into manufacturing

and into services, the only way that happens is if

the productivity of agriculture increases.

Right?

Per worker, per unit of land.

Um, productivity of agriculture has to increase for us to

experience economic growth, right?

So let's not forget that, uh, I talked about how

the structure of medieval society geared that to the organisation

of medieval agriculture.

In some ways, they're constantly informing each other.

Um, and we talked about the organisation, uh, of medieval

settlements that obviously are primary agricultural and why they distributed

land in such a strange way.

Right.

Um, but over the pre-industrial period, Agricultural productivity.

I said it needs to increase and it does.

Right?

Um, what we want to talk about today, uh, is

how, uh, European, primarily European agriculture managed to increase its

productivity over the course of the pre-industrial period.

And then at the end, we're going to compare this,

uh, to what happened in pre-industrial China, which kind of

foreshadows a bit this great divergence debate.

Right?

The great I mean, I started off this course saying,

we're here in this department at LSE to understand why

some places are rich, why some are poor, why that

has been the case in the past, why it continues

to be the case today, you know, why is it

the whole world developed, etc. etc.?

Well, what we're trying to understand is why this whole

course is pointing towards why, you know, the industrial Revolution

ultimately happened in Britain right in 201.

You'll get the why did it happen in Britain and

not in France?

For medievalist, I think the more compelling question is why

did the Industrial Revolution not happened in China 500 years

earlier?

So we'll talk a bit about how agricultural technology looks

in China as well.

Um.

Two of my favourite books, uh.

Um, underpin much of what we're going to talk about

today.

Uh, Lynn White, junior, 1962, publishes Medieval Technology and Social

Change.

Uh, this book, um.

Looks at, uh, the application of horse power.

Medieval England, published in like 1985.

Uh, this book basically says, uh, horses must have been

important for, uh, social.

The establishment of the feudal social order and economic growth

in northwestern Europe.

Um, this book provides the evidentiary base kind of validity,

validating White's theories.

Right.

So.

This book, depending on who you talk to, is either

the most important book in the history of technology or

the worst history book anybody has ever really, really polarises

opinion.

Um, but basically, where do we go?

Uh, sorry.

Yeah.

Lynn White in 1962 says that feudalism, this European social

order, Is the result of the use, spread, or the

invention and diffusion of a simple piece of technology.

Right?

The horse stirrup.

Everything.

We've talked about feudalism with lords at the top and

peasants at the bottom.

This social order that define, uh, you know, most of

Europe for centuries is all the result of a very

cheap and simple piece of technology.

The horse stirrup.

Right.

So the horse stirrup arrived in western Europe from Central

Asia in the eighth century.

The logic is very simple.

Uh, you know, let's try.

The continental Europe realised that the stirrup created a huge

military advantage, right?

All of a sudden you previously had.

I mean, does anybody here.

Right?

Yes.

Uh, have you ever ridden without stirrups?

Yeah.

Yeah.

I'm not a horsey person.

Um, well, I imagine it's difficult because you're kind of

flopping around and, you know, whatever the stirrup allows you

to stand, right?

Um, and all of a sudden, you're more stable.

You can carry more armour.

Critically, you are now stable enough to hold a long

lance, etc., etc..

So the invention of the stirrup is a huge military,

uh, technological advancement.

All of a sudden, once you have the stirrup, everybody

wants horses because you're undefeatable on the battlefield, right?

Uh, but the argument goes, you need to pay for

those horses.

And they're expensive.

Horses are expensive.

So what, uh, leaders do, starting with Charles Martell, uh,

is that they create a new social system by seizing

church lands, giving them to their fellow nobles.

The knights remember, in order to endow with enough income

that they can all afford to turn up at battle

with horses and stirrups.

Right?

That's the idea.

Um, like the Anglo-Saxons in England, who we argued that

they did not embrace the stirrup, and that maybe is

why they lost in 1066 to William the Conqueror and

why they became utilised.

Right.

That's the first chapter.

Right.

You think that would be enough?

That's a pretty big idea.

Uh, pretty significant implications.

Um, but for economic historians, the second chapter of this

book is perhaps even more interesting Because he says, well,

there's another portfolio of horse technologies.

And that's the heavy cloud in northwestern Europe, right?

Not only one revolution, you know, horses and stirrups, this

military feudal revolution.

But there's also a revolution in farming in that, uh,

the northwestern Europe is wet and it has clay soils.

Um, over the course of the premium industrial period, the

economic gravity of Europe moves from the Mediterranean northwest to

the North Sea area.

This doesn't happen unless the heavy plough is applied as

a technological development, because it unlocks the potential of farming

in northwestern Europe.

So you get the heavy plough and then, you know,

you get another technological innovation that allows us to use

horses, right?

The stirrup allows us to use horses in battle.

That happens in like, the eighth or ninth century.

The horse collar allows us to use horses in agriculture.

Previously we had to use oxen.

They are slow and, uh, not as strong and not

nearly as versatile as horses are.

So the idea here is that, you know, you can't

just tie a rope around a horse's neck, because if

it tries to pull something, it'll strangle itself and cut

off its blood flow.

So another simple piece of, of technology is a part

of the horse's collar that sits on the horse's shoulders

and allows them to pull right without struggling.

And then, you know, once you have the heavy plough

and pulled by horses.

Third layer of technological innovation is the three field rotation.

All right.

Romans had to leave half of their land Follow every

year to regenerate soil fertility.

Once you have the heavy plough, hold the horses.

You have a three field instead of a two field

rotation that allows you to use well, two thirds of

your land as opposed to just half, right.

So these are, you know, I mean, I joke because

I, uh, have researched medieval horses for so long.

Um, as soon as it comes out, I can add

my own book, and there'll be three of them here

in a little triptych.

But, uh, everything that, uh.

If agriculture needs to increase its productivity in order for

industrialisation to occur.

Then you can argue that that, you know, the agricultural

productivity doesn't increase without these innovations, you know, around surrounding

animal power.

Uh, ergo, the Industrial Revolution doesn't happen.

You're embracing animal power.

So let's get into the details here a bit.

Um.

Before all of these innovations, we had what you might

characterise as Mediterranean dry farming, right?

You have a very light sheep plough pulled by one

ox.

It works in a crisscross pattern, like, you know, thinkable

graph paper.

Um.

Now, in northwestern Europe, very different climate, very different geography.

Right.

This is why we go on holiday in Italy, because

it's nice and hot and dry.

Generally here it's wet and miserable.

Um, but the soils are either heavy clay soils or,

you know, alluvial river valley soils.

What it means is to farm on those lines.

You need a heavier plough.

Any stronger draft animals.

Right?

And what ultimately happens, hearkening back to our discussion of

social order in the Roman world, you have scattered hamlets,

no feudalism, you know, here northern northwest Europe you get

the spread of manorial and serfdom all tied up with

this form of society that's been created by the war

horse, um, and supplemented by the innovations of the heavy

plough.

Right.

So this heavy plough in Latin America, um, it was

definitely unknown to the Romans, probably invented in the sixth

century.

In the Slavic world, it's not always wheeled, but often

is.

But basically what happens is it has, uh, a very

large knife that cuts deeply into the soil and this

mould board that pushes it over to one side, right,

and creates this ridge and furrow surface to the fields

that permit proper drainage when we're training moisture, right, which

basically takes advantage, it leverages the climactic conditions of northwestern

Europe, very wet, uh, to create and retain soil fertility

that allows two thirds of the land to form in

any year as opposed to just one.

Right.

Um, so this is what that looks like.

Very cheap, simple thing goes over, uh, in this crisscross

pattern, right?

Whereas you have this long, uh, heavy plough flowing in

long strips.

Right, which creates that strict, uh, settlement pattern that we

talked about last week.

Right.

Looks like this.

Once it is going forwards and backwards, it creates these

furrows.

Right.

What do the ridges and furrows do?

Well, they allow drainage and then they allow the collection

of organic material.

I didn't really understand nitrogen fixing, but they did understand

that if you have proper drainage and allow organic material

to work, it increases the fertility of the land.

Uh, and it looks like this, right.

Which you can still see today in furrow agriculture.

Um, and, you know, if you I think there's some,

like, open air anthropological museums, uh, where you could still,

uh.

Yes, I do.

Um.

It's September, and after a few days settling in, now

the team really have to get to work.

This is oxen rather than horses.

We still.

Study both.

Just walk on gently.

But this.

Come on.

Off we go.

That's where we go and do this.

I don't know who would be interested.

Uh, but.

These are English longhorn oxen.

And these stories, you can see, are about about a

ton of peace, which is a lot fatter than they

should be.

But they wouldn't let them get too thin because they

needed the meat at the end of the day.

But Arthur Lancelot here are about to write.

We should be finished by lunchtime.

Walk on.

Come on.

It's fantastic.

We've got.

Good boys.

Okay, we're coming to your turn round.

Right.

Check out.

Oh.

Come on.

We'll see how.

Successful day ploughing by late afternoon.

So.

That's the that's situation.

Right.

Eight oxen.

Right.

Uh, or maybe two horses and some other oxen.

Uh, but basically horsepower is very significant.

Uh, animals in general are absolutely essential to increasing agricultural

productivity and facilitating the economic growth that Europe experiences in

the pre-industrial period.

Uh, as a subset of that, you know, wholesale embracing

of animal power sources are particularly important, right, because they

become an economic rather than a military asset.

Um, so over the 10 to 13 centuries, you know,

oxen are increasingly replaced by horses, right?

By the time you get to the 16th century, outside

of a few places with particularly heavy soils, um, horses

have totally dominated the world of work.

Animals.

Right.

Uh, and that's the case right up until, uh, the

19th century.

Um, the advantage of horses of their.

Faster, they're stronger, they're more durable.

This has a whole set of cascading positive externalities.

Right?

Increases market integration.

If you use horses for transport, you can get somewhere

faster.

Uh, therefore, it increases your effective radius that you can

buy and sell, right?

Increases market integration.

It increases the velocity of money.

Right.

For those of you that are, uh, you know, about

to embark on, you know, financial careers or have an

interest in financial economics, you know, you might think about

the velocity of money is a modern phenomenon, but it's

very much a consideration in the medieval period as well.

All money is, you know, coins, right?

If I have to pay Gregg a pound for something,

I have to bring him a pound of pennies, more

or less.

Uh, if I can move that pound of pennies faster,

it increases the velocity of money, which we know has,

uh, Benefits for economic growth.

Horses are also crucial for Mark for the engagement of

peasants and economic activity.

Horses are cheap, so peasants can, uh, experience increasing market

integration if they use them as well.

So in theory, there's supposed to be more costly to

breed than oxen.

Um, this is based on a 14th century agricultural treatise

who I think will turn out to have been incorrect

about this.

They're also, in theory, more costly to feed.

Um, but that might not be as significant.

Horses are generally stronger than oxen, but they don't have

as much torque.

Right?

Does anybody here into cars?

Does anybody know the difference between torque and horsepower?

Well, basically you think about low gear in a car,

right?

Or a tractor or a big diesel.

The epitome of torque, right?

The ability to start moving something.

A heavy load, right?

Uh, horsepower is more important, like high RPM.

Uh, anyway, so if you have particularly heavy soils, you

might want to keep oxen, because the horses just aren't

strong enough to get the thing moving.

Um, or you have a mixed team where you have

oxen that act as kind of a low gear, and

then horses that chip in to pace later on.

Um, but in order to embrace horsepower, right, you need

to have an iron horse shoe.

Uh.

Which we haven't talked about yet.

But what kind of puts this alongside the stirrup?

Uh, as another innovation?

Um, the horse collar briefly allows horses to use the

heavy plough without cutting off the windpipe or their blood

supply.

Um, And.

So you get this agricultural revolution of the early Middle

Ages, right?

Now, the term agricultural revolution is something that's used so

frequently that it loses a lot of its explanatory power

because there's one that occurred like, let's say, 12,000 BCE,

right?

That's the Fertile Crescent Neolithic transition where humans originally moved

from foragers into farming.

That's not this.

There's also a famous one, you know, in the early

modern period, uh, that is maybe most famous, articulated by

Mark Overton.

White argues that there is, you know, another one that

happens before the early modern one, uh, that says, like,

look, you get the heavy plough, you get horsepower.

Uh, all of that facilitates three field crop rotation.

This is what allows, um, agricultural Productivity to increase the

growing population.

And there's many, many spill-over effects here, right?

Because you increase the productivity of your agriculture, you create

the possibility of releasing some of those labourers into manufacturing.

Right?

Manufacturing is more productive, therefore creates economic growth.

So there's a lot of contemporary illustrations that demonstrate this.

Right.

So here's the British Library.

This is what ox ploughing looks like.

But here's the wheeled plough.

Right.

Uh, so this centre, he's holding the plough to hold.

This guy is called a few guitar.

He's flogging the oxen to keep them moving.

Um, here is this isn't the plough.

This is a harrows kind of additional agricultural tax that

breaks up clods of soil, but you can see that

padded horse collar here.

If you look very closely, you can see the horseshoe.

Um, this guy, you know, kind of doing the ten

tour and figure tour job at once.

He's a hero to this guy, interestingly.

Not at all to do with horses, but he's called

a rook herd.

He's scaring rooks away from newly seeded corn with a,

like, slingshot.

Um, now, I said, another thing that has been thought

about is that horses actually increase.

Uh, well, they increase agricultural productivity.

Um, but the one thing we have to remember here

that's crucial to explain this is that while military horses

are quite expensive.

Um, everybody therefore assumes that horses are a luxury.

Good.

But actually, you get this bifurcation in the market for

horses.

Uh, you know, in medieval England or agricultural horses are

actually quite cheap.

War horses remain expensive.

Agricultural horses are cheap.

So you.

This is a technology that creates a positive productivity shock.

And it's widely available.

Right.

Why are there two market segments for horses?

Well, first of all, this is a feudal world, right?

So there's no middle class.

You have very rich people and very poor people.

So there's no middle class.

Um, agricultural horses are cheap, uh, primarily because low quality

animals.

Right.

They're not selectively bred in the Middle Ages.

They're they don't improve.

But there's a from the eighth century, there's a basically

a papal proclamation that Christians are not allowed to eat

horse meat.

Right.

Even where horse eating horse meat is common nowadays, like

in France, that only got reinstated in, like, the 19th

century, right?

Um, and that's basically a move by intelligentsia to say

it doesn't make sense to not eat horses if people

are starving.

Um, so the value of an animal, especially as it

ages, right?

There's three components.

The work it can do for you, it's meat and

it's hide.

Right.

Well, an older horse that, um, maybe doesn't have many

years of working life left in them.

Um, and you can't eat it because it's prohibited.

It's basically only worth as much as it's hide.

So this allows peasants to buy, uh, you know, engage

in a used car market of the Middle Ages.

And so the point is that this technology is available

to all of society, and peasants as well as lords

can benefit from, uh, the positive, productivity enhancing effects of

this technology.

And it's actually peasants who end up breathing and kind

of cornering the market for this commodity.

Uh, horses are expensive because the Lords who buy them

are wealthier.

But also, you know, there's other things driving things here,

right?

These medieval aristocrats are, you know, obsessed with conspicuous consumption.

So it's not exactly like economic decision making made on

the margin.

It's like I need a fancy horse to impress my

friends, you know, think of, you know, Ferraris, Lamborghinis around

Harrods.

It's that kind of economy.

Um, of course, if your whole agricultural paradigm is based

around, uh, the use of animal power, your human labour,

uh, kind of has to conform to that.

So most of the agricultural labour in England, um is

composed of ploughman.

That person who's either holding the plough or the person

who is flogging the animals.

Right.

Um, here's an example of horses being used in transport

from a contemporary illustration.

Uh, this is somebody taking a bag of corn, uh,

to a miller to the ground.

Or maybe he's taking flour away, although then you think

you'd be pointing in the opposite direction, you know?

Um, every time I show this picture, people ask, why

is there a monkey driving the, uh, wagon?

I do not know.

Um, equally perplexing is why this horse is blue.

I've never seen it before.

Have you seen a blue horse before?

Yeah.

There are, like, blue ribbons, and they kind of.

They kind of are bluish grey.

You learn something every day.

Um, monkeys drive carts, right?

Some horses are blue.

Uh, but here you are, three law scholars, right?

Um, and, uh, well, this is like the the the

other thing you don't get is this is like the

peak of medieval, uh, vehicle design.

It doesn't look like the kind of, you know, uh,

this is like a fancy chariot.

Carts with front wheels are an innovation of the early

modern period.

But anyway, here is horses being used.

You know, they're much faster than oxen.

So whatever goods the monkey is transporting are going to

get to their destination much faster than if they were

pulled by oxen.

Right?

There's another, yet another externality from embracing animal power right

now.

Horses don't have, uh, much value, uh, as meat or

any value is meat.

And they don't actually produce that many secondary Products.

Um, so they don't fit into this arable pastoral paradigm.

And I've never tried horse milk.

Um, but it doesn't have that much fat, right?

Relative to other kinds of milk.

You know, they start off using oxen.

Those are just castrated bulls.

Those can be fattened and sold.

Uh, you know, female cows obviously produce cow's milk.

Um, all animals, when they get used to start, uh,

produce manure, which increases the fertility of soil.

Right.

Um, so there's a kind of cascading effect of this

embracing of animal power.

Uh, and that the land starts to need to be

devoted in part to sustaining animal populations.

But you derive secondary products from, uh, this.

All right.

And we're dealing with industrial products, high protein food, uh,

soil enhancing fertilisers.

Um, now Jared Diamond has this, you know, kind of

persistent persistence argument that one of the advantages that Europe

had over the rest of the world, uh, and one

of the reasons that perhaps it industrialised is simply that

there was a wider variety of animals, a geography and

a climate that was more suited to their, uh, domestication

and exploitation.

Right.

So this is what we're going to see here as

we start to compare with other parts of the world.

Um, this is, you know, a very, very macro level

argument, right?

Um, but there's more specific economic history arguments that in

some ways, Uh.

Articulate this idea with more evidence.

Um, you know, I said we get out of power,

pulling this heavy plough, right?

Facilitates this three field rotation that instead of requiring half

of your land to remain unused every year to regenerate

fertility, only one third of it is.

So it looks like this, right?

Uh, there's a certain portfolio of crops that get planted

in the fall.

Right?

And they're harvested late in spring, and then you have

a second crop that are planted in the spring and

then harvested in the fall.

Right.

And it looks, um, increases the amount of land under

cultivation from one half to two thirds.

And it also facilitates certain portfolio of crops that can

provide for all these animals that you're using for, uh,

labour and food, right?

Um, and anyway, it looks like this, uh.

This is that kind of third layer of technological innovation,

um, triggered by the introduction of a portfolio of technologies

that allows animals in general, but horses in particular, to

be harnessed.

Right?

Uh, technology, technological innovations aren't always things right.

So, like, what is Henry Ford most famous for?

Henry Ford is most famous for the model T, but

it's not really that.

The model T was a, you know, particularly fantastic automobile.

Um, it was the process of production, namely the interchangeable

parts and the assembly line, and only making it available

in black.

Um, that is the more important process than innovation of

process.

That's what this three field rotation is, right?

It is a technological innovation.

It's just not a tangible thing.

It's a process.

Um, looks like this.

Um, I mean, my missing anything about the three field

rotation?

No.

Uh, so this is only found in north western Europe,

right?

It's not found in, uh, the Mediterranean world.

Uh, if you recall, if you encounter the term mixed

husbandry, uh, in the literature, that's what this is referring

to, you know, embracing animal power, balancing it with arable,

typically a three field system.

Okay.

So how does this work with Asia?

Right.

This is derived from primarily from the work of Sugihara,

Japanese scholar.

Um.

And much like Dion says, look, Europe was just endowed

with more animals or more easily domesticated.

It could be used both for food and for energy.

Right?

Very, very broad.

And hearkens back to what we talked about in the

very first week.

It says, look like all of this is just determined

by luck endowments, right.

What things do you have?

What is the climate like?

Da da da da da.

Um.

Sugihara says uh.

That Asia and Europe, you know, from as far back

as the Black Death and I would probably argue, even

before became kind of locked in to two different paths.

Right.

I said earlier that agriculture, you know, you can't escape

the realities of agriculture, even if your economy is largely

driven by higher productivity sectors, you still need to feed

the people, and therefore it's utterly dependent on the productivity

of your agriculture.

What happens is that England exploits animal power.

Because of this portfolio of technological innovations that I discussed

that allows them to grow this portfolio of crops.

Um, but with land, extensive harnessing of animal power, the

most economically, agriculturally and economically productive, productive parts of Asia

is the Yangzi Delta, right?

The Yangzi Delta, uh, grows only rice, basically, and has

much higher yields per acre, actually, than Western Europe does,

but critically is utterly dependent on the intensive use of

human labour.

So the comparative point here between Europe and Asia is

that that productive part, the highest productivity part of Northwestern

Europe, right uses animal power, animal and energy in a

land extensive model.

Asia.

Uh, it's locked into the labour intensive use, um, uh,

of human labour.

Why are we focusing on the Yangzi Delta?

Well, China is huge compared to Europe, right?

This is what Kenneth Pomeranz does or did in the

year 2000, which was a methodological innovation.

He said, well, let's compare England.

The most productive part of Europe is the most productive

part of Asia.

And that's where this stuff comes from.

Right.

So you end up with a land to labour ratio

and the Yangzi Delta, there's only 1/20 of England's right.

But Sugihara says.

I think it's a bit slow.

Uh, come on, you can do it.

There we go.

Um.

Crop rotation, you know, that's a massive boom in Europe.

Doesn't happen in East Asia.

Um, we reach this kind of equilibrium where pasture is

balanced with arable land in Europe.

Doesn't happen in Asia.

Um, so Sugihara says these are two different paths of

development.

Western Europe crop pasture path right.

Has a crop rotation system, produces a mix of grains,

uh, suitable for both humans and animals.

Right.

Also has a positive externalities of producing wool.

Right.

Dairy products, meat.

Big farms.

Right.

East Asia, he calls the crop crop path smaller farms.

Right.

Hardly any reliance upon draft animals.

Not completely absent.

But it's mostly human labour, right?

Um, that is not to say I've coached this whole

thing in saying there's a really impressive Slate of technological

innovations that allow northwestern Europe, which is going to basically

take over the world at the end of our period,

um, to harness animal power, use it in a land

extensive model and reap all of the rewards.

Right.

If you read the classical economists, Malthus, etc., they would

tell you that China was a backwater.

Well, it's actually the opposite.

So don't leave this room thinking that the technological innovation

of Europe were in any way superior to that of

China.

China has its own portfolio of technological advances.

They're entirely different.

They're mostly hydraulic, you know, artificial irrigation.

Um, they're they have their own portfolio of fertilisers.

They use soybean cakes.

Right.

They're much more advanced in, um, technologies that lower the

cost of access to knowledge.

So they have a printing press.

Basically, we've got printing so they can, um, print and

circulate agricultural knowhow.

As early as the 19th century.

Right.

So China doesn't stagnate, you know, so you might think

well about technology and how technology led to growth.

And then, uh, you know, we know you're the first

area to industrialise.

Right.

What is going on here?

Um, if it's not about technology, you know, why did

the Industrial Revolution not happen in China 500 years before?

Well, it hearkens back a bit to what we were

talking about previously in our week on population resources, because

there's a similar strand.

Come back to the idea of involution, which is a

term coined, um, by.

Uh, Clifford Geertz, a very famous anthropologist.

Uh, so There is an assumption here where technology is

basically static.

Now that is strictly speaking, not true.

There are technological innovations in Asia, but basically they get

to a state, uh, where the innovations can raise productivity

per unit of land, but they cannot raise productivity per

labourer.

So the land gets increasingly divided, population rises, more farmers

work.

Each day is on each hectare.

Right.

Um, and the output per hectare rises through that intensive

growth model.

Right.

Where there's lots there's more humans.

Right.

We put more humans on the land.

We increase the productivity per acre, but actually the productivity

per person, right, will fall.

Uh, right.

Because labour run into, uh, the law of diminishing returns,

right?

I've given everybody my washing machine story.

No.

Dishwasher story.

Yes.

Same principle here.

And lower labour productivity than meets the lower real income

for farming.

Right.

So the point is two stories of technology here.

Right?

Europe.

Has this suite of technologies that allow it to use

animals for work and animals for war.

Uh, and it unlocks the productivity of northwestern European agriculture,

which then, you know, creates an opportunity for that labour

force to be released later in manufacturing.

And you get the Industrial Revolution.

Um, it's not that there was any kind of inadequacy

necessarily in East Asian technology.

They have a different portfolio of agricultural technologies.

But, you know, as Sugihara says, there's two paths of

development.

Asia's so reliant on human labour for its agricultural productivity

that it faces these diminishing returns experienced in Europe.

Right.

Um, so there's this range of, uh, agricultural innovations in

China, right?

Knowledge is better, uh, use of being paid to manure,

river lime and as fertiliser, better seeds, better water management.

Right.

But all of this requires a lot of human labour

inputs.

Right?

Um, the bean cake revolution as a fertiliser, as a

technological positive technological shock is very, uh, important in East

Asian agriculture.

But it comes quite late, right?

Uh, the Yang Zi Delta, which we're focusing on here,

only receives it, uh, when trade is liberalised in the

17th century.

Right.

Um, and, you know, I think the argument would be

that the population, it's enough to maintain low living standards,

but not to fundamentally reverse, uh, the trend of evolution.

Right.

Um, talk about this already.

So this comes from the work of Alan, right?

Chinese, uh, agricultural productivity.

Uh, it's actually quite high, but remains basically static.

Right.

Um, and if we compare, you know, England at the

end of our period in the 19th century with kind

of two cross-sections of China in, uh, the 17th century

and the 19th century.

What do you see?

Uh, you basically see the output per acre is quite

a bit higher, but it's not really improving over two

centuries.

But the labour input that's required significantly higher in the

Yangzi Delta than it was in England, right by like

almost an order of magnitude.

So 13 days per acre of human labour versus 112.

And actually the amount of human labour that's required required

to moderately increase the output is significant.

So what you get is the output per day is

lower in the 19th century than it was in the

17th century in China.

Right.

So, um, stagnating living standards.

And this is basically why is that you get it's

an alluring path to development because the returns on additional

units of labour are higher than they are for other

crops.

But you still have a threshold where you saturate, um,

the saturate the, uh, land with labourers and the returns

diminish.

Um.

I'll leave it there because I want to.

It's our last week.

Next week is reading week, and I just want to,

uh, touch base kind of administratively where everybody is.

Remind us of where we are.

So.

Where's my schedule?

Uh.

Yeah.

Uh, so we have our, uh, 500 word essay, which

is due tomorrow.

Uh, this is going to be marked, um, I think

starting after reading week.

During reading during reading week, Greg great.

Send them.

Right.

Send them around.

Um, so that's our first opportunity for you to familiarise

yourself with cultivating an argument.

Um, and then, uh, our next paper is not due

until the end of the term.

So you have a little bit of breathing room, but

that's going to be your first kind of substantive piece,

uh, of work.

Release the questions for those, uh, after reading week's break,

everybody.

So we have, you know.

To be fair, it's only five.

You know.

Yeah.

Yeah, we do have one.

Yeah.

You can never get back.

So you want to make that.

Matter so.

That people.

Yeah, because I got something.

I'll see you later.

What's that supposed.

To mean?

This time of having to reread some 60 pages?

Yeah.

I still want to revisit.

Just like I didn't want to accidentally like myself.

But this is like, the notes are summaries, but I'm

not going to put everything on.

Anything I say.

Are you going back?

I was like, yeah, I want you to look.

It's time to go.

No, no, know, the guy said, like it's coming from.

Wait.

No.

No.

Don't.

Go past.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Yeah.

Uh, yes, I think.

I'm.

Going back down.

I'll be stopping.

How about you?

Uh.

Um.

Oh, yeah.

Yeah, I'll probably be that quick, and.

Then, uh.

Thank you.

Lecture 6:

This happens every week.

It is absurd.

I like thinking.

I have enough time.

In.

One year of my life.

Why don't you just.

My love won't release a smile on me.

It's just me.

Now with Sam.

Now we say.

Now we're inside.

Water is just my love.

Whatever it says, my love.

Won't you believe my love won't be wrong.

It's just my love.

Not where it's at.

I wish I had no reason.

To feel Also, what will your eyes look in your

eyes?

You got one thing on.

Your eyes again.

I don't know what to believe.

You're nothing again.

Now it's time.

Now listen.

Now listen.

Now listen.

Now listen.

Now we tell ourselves.

Now.

No, I won't anymore.

Let's go back.

Inside of my production.

I'm just spend some time.

Here.

I just think.

I don't know, I just like, plays in my space.

They could have called it indifference curves in production.

Right?

It.

Felt like a.

Dream.

Oh.

Thanks, Roger.

I got there in ten minutes.

One of the things.

that.

I during the summer and I'm not really sure about

it, but I don't know.

This is the thing.

During the interview.

I mentioned.

Good luck.

Yeah.

I'm like, yeah, I got yeah.

I'm still gonna get fired because I was, I had.

I don't know.

This year.

And I'm thinking.

Oh I'm like.

Yeah it's a different time now.

Like yeah.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I think my favourite one.

Yeah, I don't know.

I try to do something like.

It's like.

If you're gonna do it.

I try to do it.

Yeah.

And then you do it.

Yeah.

Oh I think.

So.

Yeah, I.

Like that.

I.

Like it.

Yeah.

The other one.

Yeah.

You have to like what it's been like.

Yeah.

No.

Yeah.

Like.

I'm not like.

It's like.

It's like.

Oh, well.

It's like sort of.

Finished.

Nice I.

Just finished.

Just.

Another I.

Hope you all had a, uh.

Productive reading week.

Was a productive and rest and recuperation or productive in

reading.

And I know those of you with courses in the

economics department still have stuff to do.

Um, but yeah, I spent a lovely weekend in medieval

Belgium.

So the medieval parts of Belgium, Belgium is still medieval.

Uh, at least not in every way.

Um, so today I want to talk about urban manufacturing.

Um, and as a phenomenon and a kind of question

of interpretation is about the role of guilds in urban

manufacturing, um, which will give us a lot of potential,

uh, things to discuss.

Um, on an opportunity in your next essay, which I'll

talk about at the end of the class.

Right.

So far, so far this term, we've talked about the

rural world predominantly.

Right.

Uh, we've talked about this factors.

But those exogenous factors like climate and geography have typically

been linked to outcomes in agriculture.

Um, we talked about population and resources, right?

Albeit and most of the population was rural agricultural farmers.

Um, and uh, people are, uh, you know, most of

these farmers are producing the, the food.

Uh, so that has been a question which is focussed

on the rural part of the world as well, although

obviously the population included some, uh, urban dwellers, uh, but

basically been working on the primary sector.

Right.

The agricultural economy.

And I underlined the importance of that, whether you're talking

about the medieval period or most people work in agriculture,

and therefore it's very important because it provides the food

and the employment, but also, you know, for later periods

of history when we get sectoral shifts, structural change, we

workforce moves out of agriculture and into manufacturing and then

later into services.

Agriculture remains important because it needs to increase its productivity

in order to create the same, at least the same

amount of agricultural produce with fewer labourers.

But anyway, the point is, now we're moving into the

urban world, right?

So stop thinking about the countryside.

As interesting as it is for people like myself and

Greg, and let's start thinking about the urban world.

Um, you visited a very nice part of the medieval

urban world, and, uh, Jen and Bruce this weekend.

So if anybody wants to get a sense of what

medieval urban environments were like, those are two good examples

of places you can visit easily on the train.

Um, so we want to talk about that secondary sector,

thinking about the manufacturing industry now.

Right.

So this is important because it's a more productive part

of the economy.

Right.

Productive than agriculture.

It produces, you know, the agricultural economy produces food.

The manufacturing economy produces things which in many ways might

be no less essential.

Right.

Clothing, shoes.

Um, they also produce some foodstuffs and things.

So urban manufacturing is clearly important.

Um, but most of the urban manufacturing, uh, was controlled

by an institution in the pre-modern period called craft guilds.

Right.

Not entirely.

You know, urban manufacturing is not totally equivalent to guild

manufacturing, but they were the institution.

Um, definitely in Europe, but also in Asia that governed

urban manufacturing, most manufacturing done in urban environments.

So you know that what productive manufacturing sector that we're

exploring for the first time, you know, controlled by an

institution called gilts.

Right.

But what you'll see when you start reading the literature

is that historians are entirely conflicted about how good or

bad guilds were for the medieval economy.

Right?

Um, I mean, this is why, you know, Greg and

I are still employed because despite lots and lots of

time and lots and lots of manuscripts read, historians can

still not decide, can still not get on the same

page about whether a totally, uh, fundamental aspect of medieval

life in early modern life, with good or bad right

opinions are polarised.

So set the scene a bit.

Right.

Urban manufacturing in the pre-industrial world is, you know, we're

moving out of the agricultural rural world into cities and

towns and manufacturing, but is still very, very different than

the picture we probably get in our heads when we

think of manufacturing as kind of products of the modern

world.

Right?

So most urban manufacturing is done by craftsmen in small

workshops of like one and a half people.

Right.

So, you know, think about working in the garage with

your dad, something I spent lots of my, uh, childhood

doing.

Um, that's basically the scale of, you know, urban manufacturing

in the pre-industrial period, right?

Relative to the manufacturing, you know, we're more probably familiar

with, uh, of the 19th and 20th century and definitely

of the kind of industrial revolution that you're all, you

know, learning about in 101 and kind of where we'll

get to at the end of our course.

Right.

Let's capital.

there's very relatively fewer, uh, labour saving technologies.

Um, there's very few of these macro inventions which you

might call a general purpose technology or GPT, but, uh,

technology over the period, kind of in Europe especially, um,

increases, uh, slowly, slowly, slowly but steadily.

Right.

So over the course of the early modern period, we

get incremental improvements, which actually, you know, contribute quite a

bit to the in the day.

It's a bit like savings, right?

Even, you know, a couple pounds a week, uh, can

become a big number at the end of your life.

Um, much use of tacit knowledge.

Right.

So this is an era we're living in before the

printing press has created, and even after it's created, still

a lot of knowledge is spread, uh, tacitly, right along

with the important knowledge the Productivity is tacit knowledge.

What is tacit knowledge is basically learning by doing, right?

Why is that important for our story about urban manufacturing

and guilds?

Because guilds transfer this tacit knowledge.

They train human capital or provide, uh, you know, a

service to human capital, to raising human capital by training

the next generation of skilled artisans in this apprenticeship business

apprenticeship system.

It's a seven year contract.

You start as an apprentice and you learn the trade

over time and eventually become a journeyman.

And then maybe a master yourself, right.

So I think Greg is doing a PhD right now.

That's kind of like an academic, uh, apprenticeship.

Um, although, uh, Greg is lucky that they only last

three years as opposed to seven.

Otherwise you'd have to spend another four years with me.

Um, but they also exist today, right?

Lots of craft apprenticeships, plumbers, electricians, tattoo artists.

Uh, anyway, so that's.

But what we're transitioning from is something that looks like

this in Europe, or maybe this in Asia to the

kind of factory system we're more familiar with, right?

Um, yeah.

Some theory.

Right.

We've talked about a few, uh, neoclassical concepts to pin

our empirical historical discussion on.

Right.

And the issue of technology.

Uh, you know, within agriculture, which you talked about last

week, but especially within manufacturing, um, that opens up a

new channel, a new neoclassical thinker we have to think

about.

Right.

Uh, and the issue is that other forms, you know,

non technological forms, uh, economic growth and neoclassical world, uh,

have bottlenecks or problems.

Right.

So if we increase the capital to labour ratio, trigger

growth, but because capital goods depreciate this is temporary.

Marginal returns on investment always fall.

So you can't, you know, invest your way to growth

ad infinitum because Sylveon growth basically that's the theoretical model

which is a temporary right.

Um, we haven't talked about trade yet.

We will.

But that's another channel.

If you're, you know, playing, you know, the medieval game

and your goal is to grow your economy, right.

Trade is an obvious one.

Settlers of Catan.

You've ever played it?

Uh, but basically this is specialisation.

Um, and it increases the effectiveness of labour.

Uh, and this is something to grow.

Right.

But there's a lot of things required for smithing growth

that don't always exist.

Every where in the pre-modern economy, you need free markets

and labour, capital and commodities, right?

Hard to move things over long distances in the medieval

period.

Transport.

Isn't that great?

Um, but what you can do is increase the effectiveness

of that capital.

This is what we call innovation.

So if you if you're thinking about technology and you

want to pin it on a neoclassical thinker, we are

probably talking about Schumpeter here.

It's the one neoclassical model that considers technological innovation a

prime mover.

Right?

What is the key?

What is Schumpeter its most famous concept?

I hear somebody whispering it talk to the sea.

Two words.

Schumpeter is most famous for creative destruction.

Right?

Am I right?

Um.

Creative destruction.

Right.

So this is, uh, I think the, um, modern people

probably call it being a disruptor or something.

Right.

But the idea is you don't provide the iteration of

the horse harness.

Instead, you destroy the horse transport industry by creating the

automobile.

Um, but that is creative destruction.

Okay.

So why is he working for economic development?

Well, that foreshadowed a lot of this, right?

Uh, modern economies have large manufacturing and services sectors.

Right.

How do we get there from the agricultural world that

we spent so many weeks describing?

Um, and there's a range of theories here, right.

You might think about is there a push, uh, from

three industrial manufacturers, entrepreneurs or firms, right.

That nudge it in that direction, which, uh, is something

we would call proto industrialisation, which has a lecture onto

itself coming later.

Um, or is it a change in the levels of

supply?

The stock of knowledge.

Right.

Does transitioning.

Getting your economy to move at low productivity agriculture into

high productivity manufacturing?

Does that depend on knowledge and human capital?

Right.

And if it does, then we need to think about

how human capital varies across Eurasia.

Right.

And this is basically what endogenous growth theory is about.

Um, human capital, you know, was important in the Middle

Ages, as we'll see.

Uh, it remains important because all of us in this

room, in one way or another, are here at this

spot in London right now to increase our human capital.

Right.

Um, and then there's obviously questions about when it makes

sense to invest in capital intensive production.

The factor prices.

So E 101.

Right.

You know, if you haven't talked about it yet, you

will talk about it.

There's a debate about why the Industrial revolution happens in

England rather than France.

And you, you know, presented with the two competing supply

side explanation, one made most famous by John Walker, saying

it's all about the stock of knowledge that it happened

to appear in England at that time versus Paul Allen,

who says it's about relative prices, economic incentives.

It's just simply, uh, was more incentive.

People were more incentivised to replace human labour with mechanical

labour in England because wages were higher.

Right.

That's why.

Um, technology is important.

I mean, this is another thing that people still can't

agree on, right?

Guilds are one thing.

This is another thing.

Um, of course we're not thinking we're going to get

to the Industrial Revolution again.

That's kind of the natural end of our our narrative.

More pressing question for us is probably not why the

Industrial Revolution happened in England rather than France.

Why?

It didn't happen in China 500 years earlier.

Um, so all these ask, like systems of production and

related questions like technological development, uh, how do we link

that with economic growth?

Um, so pre-industrial production, you know, how is characterised, uh,

by, you know, a number of things that may be

slightly foreign to our, you know, modern sensibilities, right?

Um, so people tend to produce in small units.

As I said, these workshops are often built around families,

although the family might expand its operation by subcontracting out

to another, uh, thing on the job training.

Right.

This is apprenticeship.

Now, most of us are here learning a bunch of

stuff, acquiring some skills, and then we're going to take

it to the workplace.

You're going to take it to the workplace.

You know, I think the idea goes, uh, pretty trained

and ready to go.

This is the opposite, right?

It's on the job training.

Um, there's no there's no university to get you into

a craft guild.

Um, but also producers of manufactured goods in urban environments,

often, uh, businesses.

Right.

These are either guilds or states.

So some single entity controls access to and methods of

production.

I don't know if we have an example of that

today.

Is there, you know, a modern producer monopsony for anything

that anybody can think of.

I mean, if Elon Musk is heading there with rocketry,

I suppose, but even he doesn't have monopsony yet.

Um, yeah.

You don't say the NHS in the UK?

Uh, yeah.

I guess the NHS probably restrict the labour market to

the UK, but there's still like some private trade that

could go on, but that might be a good example.

Um, anything else is monopsony as well.

Anybody has another one that springs into mind over the

remainder of the lecture.

Please stick up your hand.

Um, yeah.

Why are we talking about urban environment here?

Right?

Well, I guess because we'll talk about rural manufacturing later.

But high skilled industry is mostly urban.

Um, basically, it's very labour intensive.

Not that much capital involved, right?

The thing to remember here, in terms of manufacturing and

many other things, is that in the preindustrial period, Europe

and England in particular lags behind China and India.

Right.

A few time travelled yourself back to the 13th century

because they don't.

All right.

Elon Musk asks you if you want to be the

first person to go back to medieval Europe.

Uh, in his new time travel machine.

Don't do it.

Uh, very dangerous place.

But if you did, you're not thinking Europe as a

place that would go on to conquer the rest of

the world, right?

I first experienced modern economic growth because they lag behind

in most manufactured goods.

Most areas of technology, they struggle to match the quality

of Asian goods.

Um, the one thing they are good at this early

in the period is producing weapons.

Right?

Which again, we'll talk about in a later lecture on

war.

Um, so, uh.

Despite the fact that they aren't making things that are

as nice, they do have a long history of artisans.

Uh, and the breadth of the things they're engaged in

is more expensive, more extensive than in Europe, which might

be a benefit in the long run.

So that is urban manufacturing, right?

That's the historical context.

Um, I don't want to talk about this institutional kind

of theoretical stuff.

Theoretical, but the institutional layer that controlled manufacturing.

Um, any questions so far?

Okay.

So most manufacturing, right, uh, is organised.

Production is organised in urban centres by schools.

Right.

We need to understand what these institutions are and what

effect they have.

So organisations in the literature you might hear about corporations,

um, but they're groups of artisans that regulate trade and

provide social but interestingly also religious services to their members.

Right.

Um, so the very common from the 11th to 19th

century, uh, in most urban areas in Europe, but even

some rural areas, uh, they're entirely self-governing, right?

There's very little intervention in the state for most of

the period.

And actually, guilds become so powerful and so influential in

certain places that they can actually become urban governments.

Right?

Uh, there have coercive powers.

Right.

Remember, we use the political science definition of a state,

and that was anybody that, you know, controlled the monopoly

of violence.

Um, you don't quite get to that state level, but

they have coercive powers to punish their members.

Uh, essentially because these have courts and powers have been

granted by authorities, but because they serve that function and

also provide religious services, religious services are important, remember, because

I said there's no such thing as a medieval or

early modern agnostic, right?

Everybody believes in something.

Um, so they're providing all of these services that sometimes

they become the urban government.

Um, and See, there's no legally codify or enforce notion

of equality in the preindustrial world, especially, you know.

I mean, we're thinking what medieval Europe, whatever rights you

had, depended on the role you found yourself in society.

Uh, so this is what they do.

Um, they are fundamentally different from modern business association, right?

Uh, and at least on the continent, slightly different.

As I said, they have their own measures of coercion.

Um, so, I mean, I asked if anybody, uh, can

think of a modern monopsony.

Um, the provision of medical services is one thing that

has been floated.

Uh, doctors, you know, modern world in certain places, uh,

have organised themselves into guilds.

So it's probably a pretty, pretty good example.

And that's why can anybody think of a modern institution

that sounds at all like how I'm describing these guilds?

Yeah.

Now it is an interesting contraption.

Which is a better option.

Oh, OPEC, uh, coalition of oil producers.

Um, yeah, I think I mean, if you have any

kind of supranational, you know, in the Middle Eastern world,

you have a coalition of people who produce oil, and

they can actually fix the price of oil by manipulating

how much or how little they produce.

Um, would that be a guild?

I mean, I think a lot of, a lot of

the similar things that are going on here in terms

of collusive cause I'm monopolistic power that can influence the

market, uh, the ability to exclude others.

Um, so maybe not a perfect map, but very, very

close.

Yeah.

Trade unions.

Trade unions.

That is an interesting one.

Right.

So big difference here is that these are employers who,

uh, are putting together the control of the market.

Um, labour unions are groups of labourers who often directly

impose the employer.

So in some ways, labour unions are like the antithesis,

uh, to guilds.

And I don't think, do you think any early modern

guild would have tolerated a labour union?

Right.

I mean, these guys are worse than Amazon, and Amazon

doesn't tolerate labour unions.

But in terms of some of the guiding principles of,

uh, you know, getting the labour of a certain craft,

we'll get together to form a labour union like the

Auto Workers Union and collective action to champion, um, the

right of a, you know, collective body.

In that way.

They're similar.

So the kind of simultaneously, uh, similar, I think, because

you're dealing with monopsony and trade unions are labourers.

Um, they're all Simultaneously and as the antithesis.

Okay, so what do they do?

Right?

Also, if they see things.

They often come and purchase, uh, raw materials.

Right.

So they all pool their capital together to, um, source

and probably get a good price for whatever you love.

Or if you're a leather worker.

You know, silver if you're a silversmith.

Um, the interesting thing is that they share common methods

of production.

Right?

So if you're a silversmith and you're in the, you

know, London silversmiths guild, there's only so many ways you

can make a silver bowl.

Method of production is controlled by the guild.

Now what does that mean for innovation or the potential

for innovation.

Right.

That's something we need to think about.

Um, the output, the, you know, frontier.

It means indirect frontier production is at least indirectly restricted.

Um, because, as I said, the types of products are

defined.

Uh, the working hours are limited.

Which.

Right.

I mean, we think in the modern era is probably

generally good for labourers.

Um, but then what it does do is serve to

keep prices at a certain level.

Uh, the number of workshops per town and the number

of staff in a workshop.

And the training is also defined.

So they're controlling every facet of, uh, production.

But as you can see, like what this will do,

uh, is eliminate competition or even the potential for competition,

which will obviously keep prices high.

So it is, you know, game theory good if you're

in, bad if you're out.

Um, and at some points they'll even can tell can

dictate where finished goods can be bought and sold.

Um, speaking of game theory, right.

There are lots of ways you can model a guild.

Uh, as you know, in prisoner's dilemma situations.

And don't worry too much about this because it will

not be on the exam.

Um, but if you're into game theory, uh, there's a

lot of ways to model this.

But basically the issue is that in prisoner's dilemma situation,

defecting is always a dominant strategy, right?

Uh, and the solutions to this are to kind of

have open ended repeated games, um, or you have sanctions.

Right.

And that is basically what guilds do.

They have the ability to sanction their members so that

everybody cooperates in a way that's conducive for the interests

of the group.

The other thing here is that the membership is very,

very restrictive.

They're the opposite of inclusive institutions.

Right.

Um, restricted by birth.

Right.

Who you are, family come from.

Maybe you could marry into, you know, a guild family.

Um.

It's exclusive.

You know, also, because it required this on the job

training in the apprenticeship form.

You know, even if you had a natural ability, uh,

shoemaking, if shoemaking was controlled by a guild in your

town, you are not allowed to make and sell shoes.

Right.

So that is exclusive as well.

Um, which, you know, there's conflicting forces.

You you typically think about human capital being good, fostering

that must be positive.

But any situation that requires a certain level of qualification

is exclusive by definition.

Um, in some places you could buy membership in the

guild, or at least buy your way in to be

taken on as an apprentice because you pay a fee

to enter.

Right.

Uh, guilds typically don't admit.

Right?

Uh, so Restricts, you know, half of the labour force

immediately.

But obviously if this is a cheap route for the

for acquiring human capital, that might provide social mobility, then

this has huge effects on differential levels of social mobility

experienced by men.

Um, so this here, uh, you know, shows, uh, the

amount you have to pay to get in and the

years of traded trade provided in different cities, uh, for

both Sons of masters and, uh, outsiders.

So, you know, what you see here is that if

you're an outsider, you have to pay more to get

in and typically have to do more years of training

in order to become, uh, journeyman.

So the cost to, you know, enter the credits.

It's higher for outsiders than it is for insiders.

Just one way you can show how exclusive guilds are.

um, no.

This restricted membership is obviously in the interests of, you

know, the people who are heavily invested in the guild.

Um, but it's not disapproved of by society.

Right.

Far from it, actually.

You're dealing in a society which, you know, thinks in

orders.

Remember we talked about the three estates, those who fight,

those who work, uh, those who prey.

Right.

That was a very natural order of things.

The urban world, you know, uh, you know, so in

the medieval world, guilds existed within that paradigm.

Right.

Um, but there's a distinctive belief system around around all

of this stuff.

I think that good economic behaviour depends on regulation.

Right.

People thought that markets needed external ordering.

Um, skilled workers have acquired, uh, you know, some kind

of property in their occupation, right?

I mean, in some ways, that's what you were doing

here.

You're going to get a degree that gives you something

tangible you can take out into the world.

Right?

And obviously, you know, you probably feel like, you know,

though, you want to have fully earned that degree, uh,

and whatever that might bring, people thought the same way.

Um, so that's not entirely foreign to our, our modern

world.

Um, but these cities, by and large, in Western Europe

anyway, is kind of a self-governing thing, right?

We'll talk about free cities.

So they kind of exist as countries within countries in

many ways, but basically they have exclusive rights to trade.

Many of them do so, given that the city have

been granted exclusive rights to trade.

People didn't think it was that weird that certain groups

would be granted exclusive rights to engage in, uh, production.

So we talked about how guilds control who can work

in trade.

And we also talked about how they controlled, you know,

the production.

Uh, here's an example.

Goldsmiths of London producers going place.

This guy named John, uh, in the stocks.

Does anybody know what stocks are?

Right.

There's things where like a stick your head in your

hands through and somebody clamps you in, and then, like,

you're not free to defend yourself so you can throw

rotten food or whatever.

Um, anyway, uh, in the stocks with the bulls, uh,

these must be gold bulls he'd made.

He had deceitfully manufacturing hanging around his neck.

So he'd done something wrong with these bulls, right?

Deceitfully made.

Maybe he hadn't made them to the common standards.

Maybe he had made them when he wasn't qualified to

do so.

Uh, right.

Because he's not yet, uh, a journeyman.

Um, maybe he had sourced the gold, you know, outside

from outside the guild.

Anyway.

He did something wrong.

He was supposed to feel shame with his deceitfully produced

balls.

But also, they have the.

They have the power right to inflict physical humiliation, physical

punishment on a member of the Guild.

Right.

Like those of you who go on to work in

investment banking.

Like.

I'm not sure.

I'm not sure.

I mean, you might get work very hard.

I'm not sure anybody will put you in the stocks

at JP Morgan.

Oh, right.

Um, anyway.

How did this come down?

Uh, guilds come to their demise in the continent is

basically a political decision.

Um, in most of Europe at the end of the

18th century.

Um, and it happens even earlier in England, right?

Uh, basically, you're starting to get the rise of states.

And I think once you get to states, they realised

that the guilds had so much power, that they decided

that it wasn't a very good idea anymore.

But of course, the timing is interesting.

If we start to think about when, you know, we've

looked at a number of those hockey stick curves before,

when does, um, modern economic growth start to occur?

Well, right.

Maybe right around this time.

So therefore it is the abolition of guilds and perhaps

the, you know, therefore the introduction of economic freedom, coincidentally

timed.

I think a lot of people who focus on the

negative aspects of guilds would subscribe to the, uh, coincidental

or to the timing of this, um, and it not

being particularly coincidental.

Uh, does anybody ever been to Riga?

It's another.

Yeah.

It's fantastic medieval city.

Um, but a very good story here.

So this is the, you know, the Guild House?

Um, sorry, it's not the Guild House.

This is across the street from the Guild House.

I don't recall which guild it is.

Um, I have a walking tour planned to take us

on, um, before we're finished here this year.

We'll go past a number of guild headquarters in London,

but this is a building across the street from a

guild.

But the story is there were some guy who wasn't

permitted to enter the guild because he didn't come from

the right family or didn't possess enough money to buy

his membership, but nonetheless, he becomes very, uh, successful.

So he gets his revenge by building a very impressive

property across the street from the Guild.

He didn't admit him putting a cat weathervane at the

top with the cat's bumble pointed directly to wouldn't admit

him.

Um, anyway, so the sanction members, we talked about this,

but they also often offer a number of, uh, Carrots

rather than sticks.

Right?

Charitable assistance.

So, you know, maybe to see a member through a

particularly tough time, they provide a religious community.

Right.

That is very strange to us.

Religious community.

The communities are still very important, uh, in our society

today.

But to somebody that was entirely religious, they would have

been even more important.

So, uh, they're doing all sorts of other things, like

feast.

You know, everybody likes a party.

Uh, processions.

Right.

You get to feel important.

Maybe you put on some fancy clothes and be paraded

through town.

Everybody admires you.

Um, and so you're basically getting an identity now, you

know, when the Reformation happens, uh, people need to.

The Protestants look less favourably on all of this fancy

stuff.

Um, but anyway, so you can see, uh, when you

go to the Netherlands, um, places like that very prosperous

early modern urban centres.

You'll see guilds being a focus of a lot of

artwork at the time.

Right?

Um, and there are different trajectories, uh, for the foundations

of these guilds.

Uh, so you can see, you know, they're more common

in North Italy than they are in south Italy.

Right?

Northern Ireland today is still more prosperous in southern Italy.

Um, but looking at, well, modern day Belgium and modern

day Netherlands, uh, you see here something clearly happening in

the Dutch Golden Age.

So what do they do?

Well, uh, the other thing they do is lower transaction

costs, right?

In a very risky environment.

Right.

And we could, um.

Game theory.

Model this with game theory again.

Um, but here is where historians start to disagree.

So our good, our guild's good.

One interpretation would be that they're a very important political

intermediary in a kind of unpredictable world.

They lower transaction costs in an unstable environment.

Right.

We talked about smithing, and growth is achieved through trade.

We'll focus again on that later when we talk about

trade specifically.

That obviously unlocks some potential for economic growth.

Um, although it's maybe most famous by Larry Epstein, um,

late of this very Paris, uh, idea is a human

capital, one that yields increase the stock of knowledge, the

stock of skills Facilitate its transmission, um, uh, and enforcing

these training contracts by requiring anybody who wants to become

a goldsmith to undergo the same seven years of training,

um, ensures that knowledge surrounding the craft of, you know,

goal setting is maintained and passed on to the next

generation.

Right.

And the other thing they do is facilitate mobility, right.

Why is this human capital function, do you think, particularly

important in the early modern world?

Why is this important maybe more important then than it

might be now?

Anybody have any ideas?

What's fundamentally different about the acquisition or transferring of knowledge

in the medieval and early modern world.

There's less formalised education, so it gives the pathway.

Less formalised education.

Right.

Exactly.

So first of all, that's a very good one, right?

Um, universities exist at this time.

Uh, but they're primarily teaching monks and other religious people,

maybe in the 14th century there, you know, a bit

of canon law, but they're not teaching science, right?

There's no Caltech.

Uh, no MIT in the university world.

What else?

What else are you saying?

There's no formalised education.

So guilds provide the only thing going.

Yeah.

Most people couldn't read and write.

Most people are.

Illiterate.

And for most of our period, there's no printing press.

Right.

So knowledge isn't really codified.

The only way to ensure that knowledge is passed down

and maintained, let alone grown, uh, is by ensuring that

humans continue to learn the things we already know and

that that's passed on and facilitating mobility, right?

If you want to take knowledge from one place to

another.

In the pre-modern world, it requires humans themselves to move.

So guilt good by, uh, lowering transaction costs, uh, increasing,

facilitating human capital.

But that is counteracted by an argument most famously articulated

by Sheila Ogilvy.

Right.

Um, she says that guilds are rent seekers, uh, because

they restrict competition.

So we talked about rent seeking in a lecture.

Yet remember, we have so we know what rent thinker

is.

Right.

So.

Forcing them, you know, a bigger share of the pie

for themselves without growing the pie at all.

Uh.

always look.

Yeah, they maintain human capital, but they don't allow any

innovation.

If you're a person who has a good idea about

how to make better shoes more efficiently, um, you know,

you're probably not allowed in to deal.

But even if you are, you're not allowed to, you

know, bring out innovation necessarily.

They restrict the number of shops, they restrict the number

of people who can work in trade.

Therefore there's no competition.

All they're trying to do is ensure that all of

the money spent on shoes goes to them.

Right.

Probably thinks guilt that um, and I mean, these are

kind of an interesting institution because the bond between people

is occupation rather than kinship, although this overlapped.

Um, so yeah, historians might struggle to evaluate, uh, manufacturing,

um, productivity.

Uh, and you'll get into this in, in your class

and things, but a lot of ways that people try

to look at the sector is by measuring levels of

human capital, uh, measuring the mobility of labour, obviously important

for moving knowledge and a pre knowledge codification world.

Uh, and people only also use wages which can proxy

human capital through skill premium.

Right.

Um, so this is just looking at how much one

wage, uh, you know, a real wage.

So it's, you know, we're controlling for cost of living,

uh, earns rather than another.

Because if you look at such a skilled premium, we

should be able to see how much rent seeking there

was.

Uh, and what the efficiency of these training things are.

Right.

Uh, so this becomes really important when we start thinking

about, like, very long run, things like the Great Divergence,

why Western Europe grew rich before East Asia did.

Uh.

When Vanden says that Europe has an abundant supply of

skill, uh, rather relative to both southern Europe and East

Asia.

Right.

So explains both the great and little divergences.

Um, why does this happen?

Right.

Well, one argument is, you know, in, you know, in

this introduced first by Epstein and taken up by my

colleagues, uh, Chris Minns and Patrick Wallace, you know, might

be showing how, uh, guilds continue to enforce these training

contracts once you sign up.

It's very hard to get out.

Uh, so that is, you know, doing a lot of

positive things for human capital, right?

Um.

The thing here is, you know, engages directly with what

we talked about earlier, Arlen Spectre prices and incentives argument

that real wages and cheap energy stimulate industrialisation.

Right?

Um, but a lot of the high wages were explained

by the commercial success.

The success that the English had, um, experienced.

So high real wages actually reflect very high human capital

and productivity.

Right?

So we're looking at long run yields play an important

role in this.

So this was just a quick introduction, um, to the

kind of urban world for the first time to manufacturing,

you know, instead of farming again, um, we talked about

the structure of early modern manufacturing.

Uh, and we've talked about, uh, guilds.

Right.

Still very much an open debate, although my colleague Patrick

has just published a book on guilds yet.

I haven't read it yet.

I haven't asked him whether he will, and I don't

think he'd give me a straight answer.

Um, but we'll have to wait and see if, uh,

there's a it's a question of it's finally been resolved

in Patrick's book, but there's a lot of debate.

You'll talk about it.

Ultimately.

These historical debates persist long periods of time when it

isn't easy to answer them.

And things that we lack to test this empirically are

like GDP data at the local level.

So it's very hard to test a place that maybe

had a lot of guilds versus a place that had

less, uh, guild intensity.

If you can't get an economic indicator between these two

places.

Um, and actually sometimes at least qualitatively, where this manufacturing

was still strictly regulated in other ways, um, and, and

where they had little influence, uh, there's obviously confounding factors

that sometimes, uh, affect economic performance.

So this is why this has persisted for so long.

Um, but I think you'll really look forward to your

seminar this week because you can get your hands dirty

with these debates.

All right.

So that's all I have.

I just want to highlight a couple of things.

Um, next essay right is due.

Uh, on December 6th, I think.

Um.

It's coming up in a few weeks.

I'm going to release these.

Uh, I want to release these today.

Uh, so you'll have them, but it's a fundamentally different

assignment, right?

So what we did the first time was we asked

you to review an academic article.

So that gives you some practice on picking what somebody

has argued.

Some of you who choose, uh, you know, one of

my favourite books of all time, books with the fact

that that's a different beast to review than somebody like,

let's say, Sheila Ogilvy, who has a very specific argument

about.

So now.

You're good at in.

Evaluating, you know, historiographical descriptive work and others.

Will have done in.

Practice with unpicking specific arguments.

But this next essay, right, this next essay, is asking

you not.

Only to.

Review the work of others, but to answer specific historical

questions.

You are.

The.

Majority.

It should be.

I think.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Oh, you want to I go back and then I

kind of.

Get the.

I'm going to do it.

I get it.

But I.

Haven't made up.

My mind.

I was like, all right.

Teacher.

Okay.

I'll explain.

Statements like the whole I'm going to talk about.

Oh yeah.

I was like, what are you doing?

But it's way easier.

I know you have to write, not about the discipline.

One of the questions is like the opinion is more

like removing private perspective, not.

Logical containment.

So I have to talk about international relations.

View is on technology.

I think I don't know.

I think I'll give you what I think I like,

so I'm.

Starving.

But.

It's a really good.

How do you.

How do you get the boost?

Oh, I read the.

Oh, yeah.

Okay.

Oh my God, we have.

Can you see how.

Can I, can we go learn together.

Oh you're going to teach us.

Oh my god okay.

I'm actually on that.

So anyway like I don't know where it's like wherever

okay.

Wherever is good.

You have to like coordinate.

Just tell me what the book is.

To all of you.

Guys.

I.

Don't know.

You know what we have to do?

We have to let go of my boyfriend, and they

can sleep really well.

So maybe you can get my message.

Lecture 7:

Next.

Yeah.

It wasn't.

Really?

My jacket to you.

But someone has to make everything up.

That's true.

Yeah.

I feel nice.

Let's talk about.

This.

Oh.

This one?

This one?

This one.

Yeah, yeah, it's only one.

It's only like right now.

Interesting how it is.

Oh, really?

Yeah, I've.

Actually been using these.

Yeah.

Yeah.

So many things like that.

I can think of it.

Should I close the tab?

Do you like that?

Okay.

No.

Looks good, but I feel you have to try to

make me.

I can't.

But what happens when you're in a race?

Oh.

It's amazing.

But this week is Black Friday.

No, I don't think so.

What's the record?

Yeah, well, exactly like that.

So.

Like, what happens after I concentrate?

You sort of feel good, but it depends on the

wardrobe and which one looks like.

Imagine if tomorrow.

Yeah, I could see what, like the man goes.

Do you not think there's something heavy like blacks going

to go more?

Maybe.

I don't like a generator.

But, I mean, do you have a lot?

So I kind of like the idea.

And I think it's very true because I was like

a hundred years.

I guess like, yeah.

Because like for me, it was really great to see

this one because.

It's very similar.

It's like as time has gone on I guess.

Yeah.

It's very difficult to like make the same prediction that

people have been making.

So basically all the highlights are yeah, well they might

as well.

But the thing is I'm not sure.

Like this is like well I'm not sure.

What else to finish.

How about you to move into your position.

Ask for well for a place on this label.

They say to you and you.

So combo talent.

That kind of stuff.

You guys know what?

It's like there's so much.

Going on.

I also think it's interesting that.

You didn't.

All right, everyone.

Let's go.

Uh, so I'm gonna reverse things here a bit.

I'm going to talk about, uh, administrative Have concerns first

and then get into the lecture.

I'm going to move these because I will definitely trip

over them.

Um, so the essay questions have been released.

Uh, for your second essay.

Right.

This is a fundamentally different beast than the essay you've

already written, although you'll use, uh, many of the same

skills.

Right?

The first paper, uh, was a critical review of some

literature.

Right.

Which was giving you the idea to read something, synthesise

its information.

Uh, tell us a bit of what you liked about

it.

Maybe a bit about where you think it could have

been improved, or if it acts on some questions that

left others, uh, unresolved.

Right.

Maybe you need something like that.

Um, so that's a skill that we want you to

continue using.

When you start assessing the literature, that's necessary to answer

one of these empirical questions, right?

But the thing you have to add on to that

now is we need you to come up with an

answer to one of these questions.

You'll take the literature, right?

There's more than enough on the reading list between the

core and peripheral or essential and further readings.

Although if you want to bring something in from another

course, or you've done some internet searching and there's some

other scholarly stuff, right, like, uh, you know, don't give

me Joe Blow's blog on Malthus.

That's a wormhole.

You don't want to disappear down.

Um, uh, bring all of that stuff together.

Are there any questions that I can help with on

this paper?

Write the questions you should see.

Right.

As I say throughout the course, if you've been coming

and participating, you will have no surprises.

These are all kind of the motivating questions that we've

used, uh, in various weeks, But is there is there

anything I can, uh, help anybody with?

No.

Everybody is very comfortable.

Okay.

Um, second point, this is, uh.

Well, it would have been some simple citation required in

your first paper, but now we're expecting you to go

into the literature, find some arguments and some evidence for

an empirical question.

Um, and use that evidence to support whatever argument you

make that requires citation.

Right.

Uh, this is how we a, uh, you know, you

prove to us that you haven't plagiarised, which is important,

right?

That you haven't just downloaded something from the internet and

pass it off on your own.

Do not do that.

Uh, it creates more trouble for you.

Uh, and it doesn't really save that much time.

But the other point of citation is for Greg and

I to read these papers and say, oh, okay, that's

an interesting idea where you got this from?

Look to the footnote at the bottom and say like,

oh, okay, that makes sense.

Um, so if you're worried at all about how to

cite.

So it includes, you know, footnotes at the bottom of

your page, uh, and a bibliography at the end, there

is the student resource pack, which has a style guide

tells you how to cite.

And the very convenient thing is the exemplar, actually from

medieval economic history.

So, uh, follow that if you're worried about how to

cite things properly, you know, if you're using word or

probably, you know, you have software, you can go insert

footnote and it does most of it for you.

Um, questions about that.

The important thing to note here also, guys, is that

you have unless you're telling us that the sky is

blue, you have to cite something, right?

If you want to say population fell after the Black

Death.

Yes, Greg knows that.

Yes, I know that you now all know that.

But you have to go and find a source that

tells you that and put a footnote in.

Right.

Um, even if you think it's com and received knowledge,

err on the side of oversight.

Anything to add?

No.

I mean that that is what it should look like.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

Um, okay.

So, I mean, we're teaching you some stuff about pre-industrial

economic history here.

This is also our department's designated, you know, reading and

writing course.

So it's also like an essay boot camp in a

lot of ways.

So the point is you're going to come out of

E 102 having pinned down everything that's necessary for you

to write flawless essays for the rest of your career

and beyond this part of it.

All right.

So that's that, that's that.

Uh, so on to the fun stuff.

So we talked about urban manufacturing, and I probably gave

you a big spiel last week about how we were

moving out of the, uh, archaic, rustic world and into

the modern urban world.

Uh, and that was true.

Uh, but now we're back in the real world, albeit,

uh, perhaps in a more, um, interesting way.

Uh, because we are talking about manufacturing and not agriculture.

So, um.

What we're going to do is talk about some theories

about development.

Uh, talk about, uh, the putting out system, which is

a system of manufacturing outside of cities and largely outside

of the guild system that we talked about last week.

Right.

Uh, and then we're going to talk about a specific

theory that is derived from this putting out system that

tries to explain the role of rural manufacturing in the

transition, uh, from a normal industrial to an industrial economy.

Then we're going to look at some critiques of that

theory, and then we are going to look at, uh,

summary.

So the putting out system, putting out system, uh, is

a system of manufacturing or merchant send raw materials to

workers in the countryside who transform them into manufactured products.

Right.

This is an easily demonstrated historical phenomenon.

This happened.

Right?

We talk about the pre-industrial manufacturing centre sector.

Yes.

A lot of it happened in guilds, in workshops, in

cities.

Um, but a lot of it also happened in the

countryside.

Right.

Um, and we'll talk about that.

What I need to be clear on today is that

the putting up system does not equal industry always pro

industry is a theory that tries to explain the role

of the putting out system in the transition to industrialisation.

This is a theoretical construct.

This is a historical reality.

Okay, so the proto industry theory is that there is

a market oriented transformation by this putting out system.

Right.

Um, and industrialisation is the expansion of this.

Okay.

So development models in the proto industry system.

Um, we need to think about, uh, what this putting

up system is and how proto industrialisation comes out of

this idea.

Uh, so when historians are looking at the pre-industrial world,

uh, and this goes back to the 18th century, right?

There's this dichotomy still is probably, uh, between a backwards

rural world and a progressive urban world.

Um, so, you know, if we return to our discussion

of demographic, uh, concerns and the theories of methods, right.

Managers are saying that peasants reproduce like rabbits.

Essentially, they produce more humans, uh, faster than they produce

food.

And that is bad.

Um, both, you know, Marxist models, um, and kind of

market oriented models of commercialisation, which you might think are

kind of, uh, competing or if not antithetical to each

other.

Both of these will say that it's towns and the

emergence and growth of towns that break these feudal, uh,

bonds that we talked about in previous lecture facilitate socialisation,

increasing market integration and therefore creating economic growth.

Right.

So again, towns, good countryside back.

Um, those who might look at technology as an engine

for economic growth will observe the scientists, whatever those might

be in the pre-industrial period.

Uh, and entrepreneurs, uh, you know, are operating largely from

towns.

So all of these models persuasive in their own way.

They assume that the rural world is stagnant, right?

That you have to escape it if you want growth,

if you want progress.

Um, and that is what this guy Frank Mendel's, uh,

observed as well.

But he tried to articulate it in a way to

demonstrate how, uh, the countryside was actually more important, uh,

than people had given it, um, credit for.

So.

Sorry.

I probably said Mendel's saw it this way.

Mendel's did not see it this way.

What Mendel Mendel's does is he says, look, it's not

all towns.

The countryside is important as well.

In this article, um, and, uh, about proto industrialisation.

Right.

So this is his theoretical construct, right?

The first phase of the industrialisation process.

This is an idea that Mendel's invented, uh, when he

wrote this article, which I, uh, I think it's probably

in the 60s or seven days.

Um, so what is this theory if the theory goes

like this, right, that it's economic growth in the countryside,

not in cities, not in towns, in the countryside that

leads to industrialisation.

Um, why is this important?

Okay, well, Mendel's acknowledges that the so-called pointing out system

exists, right?

That's the historical reality that we all have to deal

with.

Um, a lot of manufacturing occurs outside of towns, despite

everything I told you last week, which is important.

Your talents are clearly important for manufacturing.

Maybe even more important than the countryside.

But, um, a lot of manufacturing is still going on

in rural out in rural households, right?

The other thing is the Industrial revolution, as you'll know,

for me, 101 is a British phenomenon, right?

But these pointing out system happens everywhere, you know, all

across Europe, if not all across Eurasia.

Right.

Um, so what this means for Mendel's is that if

industrialisation is what people, you know, thought brought modern economic

growth, what he says is actually there's this crucial precondition,

um, that happens before industrial industrialisation and therefore modern economic

growth happens not with industrialisation but before it.

Right.

Why is this is important.

Um, well, if you want to try to.

I mean, we're all trying to track that hockey stick,

right?

Um, to figure out what changed the how human economies

and societies to become much richer than they had been

before.

Uh, but also kind of selfishly, if you're a scholar

like Mendel's, if you can change everybody's thinking about a

pivotal point in history, then it probably helps your careers.

Right?

Um, so how does this pudding, um, system work?

Right?

This is the historical reality.

There is.

What would you call this, uh, a coordination problem?

Um, a fact of rural life.

Whatever.

But peasants have a lot of spare time.

Um, my, I come from Alberta, which is like a

pretty agricultural part of Canada.

Uh, a lot of my relatives are farmers.

Uh, they're very busy.

Um, you know, in the spring and very busy in

the autumn, and the rest of the time they play

a lot of cards, actually.

Uh, but peasants have a lot of spare time because

agriculture is seasonal work, right?

And imagine, in a world where you don't have tractors

to repair or things like that.

You know, how much time can you spend fixing your

shovels or sharpening your sky sites?

Um, so they have a lot of spare time that

they could be using productive, um, and in a kind

of low technology environment, most, you know, people in rural

households will also have the requisite skills to engage in

manufacturing.

The problem is, is they're located remotely out in the

countryside, right?

So they're separated by distance from the raw materials that

they might need.

Uh, they also don't have the connections.

They don't know the people.

Right.

Uh, to do this so they're not really able to

easily participate themselves in, And, um, manufacturing.

So the solution that was found to this is that

merchants connect rural households to their own mercantile network.

So you have a merchant who's going to import some

kind of raw material from a foreign market.

That raw material is going to be sent out to

a peasants in the countryside, uh, sent out to another

peasants in the countryside and another peasants in the countryside.

Right.

Uh, and then they send the finished products back, uh,

after they have completed them, you know, in their house.

And then the merchant sends the finished product for market

feed.

So it's really an elegant solution, brings in more of

the labour force, uh, creates additional income for farmers, um,

and provides cheap labour to merchants.

Right.

Um, the cheapness of their labour is key here, uh,

because farmers are deriving some, if not most, of their

income from their farming activities, right?

So they don't need to be provided with so-called living

wage to do this, uh, manufacturing, um, because they only

need a little bit more to kind of augment their

income.

Um, the opportunity cost of their labour is very low

in the off season because there's nothing more productive that

they could be doing.

So the marginal wage of a low subsistence in many

cases.

Right.

Um, and as I said, the situation is that the,

uh, technology requirements in textiles, in metal and leather goods

are very simple, right?

A lot of the spinning of textiles goes on in

rural households with these things called drop spindles.

Right.

Um, uh, leather working, you know, can and still be

done in households, right?

All of this can be produced by peasants in the

countryside, because there's no technological or capital requirements to get

in the way.

Um, so what the situation is, is in the sixth

or seventh 18th century, a lot of national and international

markets are being supplied with manufactured goods that were actually

worked on, at least in part, in the countryside.

Um, so this is where Mendel's conducted his study, uh,

which just the other day, uh, fantastic medieval city to

visit.

Um, so he's basically showing how, uh, the hinterland of,

you know, Bruce is around here somewhere as well, uh,

was producing manufactured goods, right?

Um, so I'm just taking you through this pudding out

system, right.

And we've explained pretty clearly, uh, why?

It was an elegant solution for everybody involved.

The farmers get something to do with their spare time

and a little bit of extra money.

Uh, the market gets some, um, manufactured goods, uh, with

the addition of cheap labour.

Everybody wins.

Right?

So what role does Mendel's have in this?

Why do we need any further explanation of this putting

out system?

Why do we need a kind of theoretical superstructure on

top of it?

Well, uh, the idea is that the early modern rural

manufacturing is for distance markets, right?

Is it?

He says it's a transitional form of manufacturing, which eventually

led to the development of factory based industry.

So yeah, said 60 to 7070.

It is 72.

He says the growth of pre-industrial industry is part of

the process of industrialisation.

Um, or rather a first phase which preceded and prepared

modern industrialisation.

So it's a very elegant kind of rhetorical move to

say, look, we know this historical phenomenon of rural manufacturing,

the putting up system exists.

But what if it wasn't only convenient, uh, for the

early modern world?

But what if it was actually a necessary first step?

So we just have slept on that we didn't realise

we knew what was going on, but we didn't know

how important it was.

What if you do not get the industrialisation that we

all know was to come, um, without first having, uh,

the putting out system in this industrial model that Mendel's

talks about.

Right.

So that is the idea, this is why the proto

industrialisation thing is a theoretical concept inserted into the historiography

to kind of raise the importance of rural industry.

Now, rural manufacturing isn't just something that we all know

happened.

It's now called industrialisation, and it's a necessary first step.

Why is it necessary?

Well, there's a number of mechanisms, but one of them

is that argues that proto industry breaks down the European

marriage pattern and lead the population growth.

Can somebody tell me what the European marriage pattern is?

What is that?

We talked about it in our demography weeks.

Anybody remember?

Yes.

And people got married later.

So potentially they'll have children later.

And then.

Yeah.

So people get married later.

Um, women have fewer children.

Brings down fertility.

Keeps population low.

Mendel says proto industry breaks down this European marriage pattern

and leads to population growth.

Okay.

Why does that matter?

Um.

Well, we'll return to that as a theory of development.

I think there's a lot in common, uh, with proto

industrialisation and Marxist, uh, thinking, which we up until now

have only encountered as this idea of surplus extraction.

Right.

Elites extract from non elites and inhibit everybody's economic growth.

Uh, but this is you know, what the core aims

of, of Marx's thinking is to explain the origins of

capitalism.

Well that's what this does, right.

He metals inserts it as a necessary precondition for industrial

capitalism.

Right.

Um, and the idea is that producers have no control

over the means of production except their labour.

Right.

So much like the Lords held all of that power

in the agricultural kind of Marxist paradigm we talked about.

The same thing is here.

All they have is their labour.

They're separated from the commercial ties that make the putting

out system work.

Um, the means of production are controlled by capitalists, right.

So here the merchants are the capitalists.

It does differ in some kind of subtle ways.

Uh, because this is an evolutionary story, and it isn't

as much about class struggle as the Marxism we've talked

about previously.

Um, now let's compare.

You know, what we know happened, the historical phenomenon and

the theory that tries to insert it as an explanatory

variable.

Right.

There's a division of capital and labour, which we think

is is probably a defining feature of capitalist, uh, organisation.

Right.

So I mean, this is a whole could be a

whole course in itself.

Marx is kind of historical materialism idea, but he thinks

there's three, you know, structural elements land, labour, Were capital,

labour, power, um, and the productive relations are either formal

laws or informal norms that determine how people relate to

these productive forces.

Right?

The superstructure.

If you come to this jargony term literature, anywhere is

anything needed to legitimise and enforce the productive relations.

Number one, um, and these have an inherent tendency to

develop, uh, when they're stable.

Um, you know, for a little while, eventually you get

some kind of contradiction that emerges in these productive forces,

and then there's some kind of revolution, and you have

new productive forces.

But this is not at all dissimilar to Cuny and

ideas of the structure of scientific revolutions.

Right?

Um, but the scholarship since the 1970s sees this theory

of proto industrialisation.

Right.

One we just talked about where it's a necessary first

stage of factory industrialisation.

Um, it breaks down the European marriage pattern and is

therefore responsible for population growth.

Right.

Um, so why is he going to put it at

the epicentre of narratives of economic growth?

Um, we need to know a little bit more about

what caused this industrialisation.

Right.

So Mendel says there's a breakdown of feudal ties.

Those things we've talked about already, uh, due to the

commercialisation of agriculture.

Right.

You know, I keep telling you, we need to escape

agriculture, and we never do.

But that's what happens.

Peasants can themselves dispose of their labour power, right?

All of a sudden, they're not tied to just serving

one Lord, um, or working for one Lord.

Uh, markets have become somewhat liberalised.

Uh, feudal ties are broken down.

Lords no longer have meetings necessary to compel workers to

work for themselves on their own manner.

Um, so peasants do what they want with their labour

power.

Right.

And in this Marxist kind of paradigm, that's all they

have.

Uh, also, there's improvements in transportation, right?

This is due to, uh, development and animal technology and

the wagons that they pulled.

Um, some are going to specialise in agriculture and some

are going to specialise in proto industry.

Right.

So this is that Smithsonian Channel where you're getting the

development and specialisation of certain areas.

Right.

Uh, and at the same time as these transport costs

are, uh, bringing in specialisation, they also will allow, you

know, low cost, high volume goods to be transported more

cheaply.

Right.

So without market integration and improvement in transportation technology and

infrastructure, this putting out system works very well because it

would have broken down with high transport costs.

But by the 17th century this isn't a barrier anymore.

Um, the other thing relates back to what we were

talking about last week, and that there's a lot of

bottlenecks within the urban guild system, right?

Somebody remind you what these bottlenecks are?

What are the you know, what are the bottleneck guilds

create?

Any ideas?

Yeah.

Quality control procedures.

How is that going to create the bottleneck for manufacturing?

Because it means that you actually have to make sure

that your stuff is cleared through those procedures before it

can be sold on to a market.

Yeah.

So you have to do things the way the guild

wants you to do it.

Um, and that makes things slightly more difficult.

What else?

What else might be a bottleneck?

The guild throws up Speculation is welcome.

Gregg almost has his hand up.

He really has some ideas here.

But we're going to.

Don't make me go to Gregg.

Uh, somebody else.

What's another one think human capital.

This might be the biggest bottleneck that it clears, right?

Yeah.

You see wages.

Pardon me.

What?

So how are wages?

The bottleneck are wages.

Yeah.

Because the guild enforces people to pay high wages.

So, uh, you aren't allowed to use the cheap labour

necessarily.

And also.

Right.

Um, if the human capital, if the number of craftsmen,

uh, and workshops are limited, then you don't have a,

you have people who could be participating in manufacturing excluded

because of the guild system.

And that's another bottleneck.

Right.

But so all of a sudden, this can be, uh,

these bottlenecks lights can be cleared and the result is

the urban merchants shift production to the countryside.

Right.

So to summarise, kind of the Mendel's argument is that

he says three things happen almost simultaneously, right.

You get this rural industry.

So that's what we've already talked about, right.

External markets for its products because transport costs have been,

um, reduced to a level, uh, where they can be

accessed and all of a sudden you get specialisation and

the symbiosis of industry and agriculture.

So the idea here is do probably to market integration

is that agriculture and manufacturing aren't competing for the same

labour.

You've got specialisation.

So actually they were complementarity on two different complementarity.

They work in a complementary fashion in two different ways.

You have specialisation.

So like Jordan's farm works on farming.

Greg Farm now works, at least in part on manufacturing.

Right?

That's fine.

But also within Greg's farm, you know, him and his

family spent some of their time farming and some of

their time manufacturing, so nothing's competing.

Greg doesn't have to make a decision about whether his

family farms or his family spins.

Right.

You can do both.

Lots of symbiosis that Mendel is talking about.

Um, so breakdown of these feudal times and their own

labour, falling transport costs and a growth in trade.

Right.

Um, those are the causes, right?

What are the consequences?

Well, now we have peasants which form a large proportion

of the society, the potential workforce.

They're not integrated into the global market.

Right.

We're going to talk later about how globalised in air

quotes is it?

Air quotes are scarecrows.

what you said.

Scare us because you're scared of it.

Maybe I created.

Has anybody else called them air quotes before?

Or is that just like a clear.

You call them air quotes before because you just do

them in the air anyway.

Um, well, now, I mean, you might have peasants in

something creating goods that are consumed, uh, you know, on

another continent, right?

Um, that's, you know, labour market integration.

Um, and this peasant is no longer some irrelevant rustic,

right?

They're engaged in the global market.

So, you know, if you want to have some economic

jargon, you say this is better factory allocation.

Um, for farmers, the labourer is more spread over the

seasons.

Right?

You don't have peak periods of intensive work.

And slack period is nothing to do.

You've got, you know, you can spread your time more

evenly.

This creates an increase in per capita output.

um, bottlenecks, as we discussed, to undermine that creates market

integration as well.

Now crucially for Mendel's and this is a big part

of his story, kind of it's the second strand of

his argument.

In addition to the proto industry is supposed to break

down the European marriage pattern because if he says, well,

peasants acquired this market orientation, right, they basically become good

little capitalists, whereas they were happy but aren't active on

their farms doing dumb farmer things before now they've acquired

discipline.

Uh, they know about the market.

They're aware of what is necessary to, uh, engage with

it, as this is the other thing that makes it

in.

If you buy into the Mendel's theory, a necessary precondition

for the later factory industrialisation that could come.

Peasants didn't simply walk off the farm and into a

factory ready to clock in at 8 a.m. and out

at 4 p.m. or whatever.

They had to necessity.

We had to train through industry to acquire this market

orientation.

Right.

That's the theory.

Um, this creates structural change.

The other strand of his argument is that because pie

apparently breaks down the European marriage pattern.

You get higher fertility creates population growth.

So now you have a surplus labour force, and the

surplus labour force are all trained little proto capitalists because

they've been, you know, making some leather goods in the

corner of their houses for a little while.

Um, and you also on the other side have increased

merchant profits.

The fact that they can employ these people cheaply means

that the capitalist profits increase, and therefore the capitalists have

enough capital to make factories eventually.

Um, I mean, I guess, you know, this is why,

uh, they don't like inheritance taxes.

I suppose we have to pass this on through the

generations.

Um, but also, not only have the workers acquired market

orientation, but the merchants, you know, who will become the

capitalists, will they apparently acquire increased managerial skills?

This could be considered a technological development on its own

right.

If we conceive technological technology very broadly as not only

things, but also processes and institutions.

So for all of this stuff together, the consequences make

proto industry a necessary precondition for factory industrialisation.

Uh, but might not be a great thing for everybody

who experiences it.

Right.

Um, it all kind of leads to this 17th century

crisis, which we'll talk about more, uh, in weeks to

come.

Um, what you get demographic decline or stagnation, uh, which

creates cheap, uh, peasant labour.

And at the same time, you get this, uh, increased

demand for consumer goods.

Uh, you know, consumers want them cheaply, and the market

is searching constantly for low costs.

Right.

So auto industry and a lot of ways is self

exploitation, right?

Now this was a theory.

I mean, who's convinced now with auto industry.

Do you think that this sounds like a sensible, uh,

convincing narrative, uh, about why industrialisation emerged when and when

it didn't or when and where it did?

One person, one believer, two believers.

Okay, so that means the rest of you are sceptical.

Is that because you've looked at my slides already or.

Um, okay.

Greg, where do you come down on this?

And firmly down.

Hand firmly down.

Okay, so.

This is something that comes up, uh, in 1973.

Uh, and the fact that you haven't heard that much

more about it since then might be why I love

your sceptics, but I'm fully on board with those who

raise their hands, because it is a very persuasive argument,

and it makes a lot of intuitive sense.

Right.

There were incentive for people to marry later.

Right?

But now you've increased the income of rural households by

allowing them to engage in manufacturing.

Their incomes go up.

They can now start their own families.

Uh, and, you know, if you maybe believe in the

innate, you know, Malthusian idea of humans to reproduce, then

that all sounds feasible.

And also, if, you know, it's very, very, um, very,

very persuasive.

But.

As is the case with most of these kind of

grand theories, what happens if somebody puts them out there

and then a series of historians over a process of

decades, uh, start to test them?

Right.

You might call this in modern science, like the replication

study, uh, and what people will say.

Okay, well, this was something that Mendel said works in

17th century Flanders doesn't work outside of Belgium.

Um, does it work in other time periods?

Um, so one of the major tenets for proto industry,

right.

If it's going to work as parochial industrialisation, the theory

that links, uh, the rural manufacturing to later industrialisation, if

that's going to work.

There's two things here, right?

There's two things that have to happen.

It has to break down the European marriage pattern.

That's one mechanism.

The other mechanism is that it has to create factory

industrialisation to the acquisition of market orientation by the peasant

labourers and managerial competence by the merchant capitalists.

Right.

So does it actually break down the European marriage pattern?

Well, when this idea starts to get exploited and this

is very, very slow work because it actually trying to

find agent marriage, uh, is a very time consuming, uh,

historical process.

But as the stuff studies start to come out, it's

not always associated with low marriage age in large households

in Europe.

Right.

Um, often people who were engaged in a proto industry

expect to inherit land, uh, because they expect to inherit

land.

Then the MP institutions that link marriage, age and inheritance

are preserved, right?

It doesn't break that down.

So therefore, there's no clear correlation between proto industry and

changes in the European Union.

So that's a problem.

That's a problem to try to universalise proto industry outside

of this one case study in 17th century Flanders.

Um, the second kind of a pillar is that it's

a necessary condition for industrialisation.

Right.

Uh, the problem is many European regions that do have

global industry, and I can't replace this because I've drawn

such a distinction between, um, rural manufacturing and proto industry.

Uh, you should think rural manufacturing here, not professional industry.

Many European regions that do have rural manufacturing don't industrialise.

Some actually lose their that should be loose and loose.

But actually in my hometown is an acquaintance of mine

who got tattooed on him.

No more love to lose.

Anyway, so some loser industry returned to agriculture.

Some continue into the 19th century doing rural industry and

don't ever industrialise.

Right.

So that means evidence doesn't map onto the theory.

Um, the other thing is that factory industrialisation actually isn't

that capital intensive, at least not at first.

So the idea that these merchants are accumulating capital, probably

over generations, that allows them to invest in factories, well,

you didn't need that capital, right?

Um, and also the cheap surplus labour force is not

necessary for an industrial revolution.

Why is that?

Well, because if we don't know anything about the industrial

revolution, anything else?

What we do know is that this is where wages

are high, Right.

It uses relatively cheap workers.

Not absolutely cheap workers.

Right.

And that's probably the nail in the coffin.

I think a proto industry, this one here, because it's

very, uh, empirically, um, uh, grounded.

Um, the other thing is, you know, another third, uh,

pillar, maybe not as important as the other two is

the proto industry was supposed to have undermined it, undermined

guilds, and created more competitive markets.

Um, but, you know, not only was industry existing in

a kind of symbiotic relationship with, uh, farming, it also

exists kind of happily alongside urban manufacturing.

Right?

Um, guilds themselves will engage in proto industry by sending

some of their products outside to be finished in towns

as kind of Subcontractors.

Um, actually, some of these guys, uh, established guilds themselves

in Germany.

Um, and actually some of the merchants, uh, are guilds

themselves, right?

So in these cases, at best, proto industry, you know,

does nothing in some it might actually strengthen the position

of a guild.

Uh, if the, the, the idea here is that we

actually look at the evidence.

It sounds very, very compelling that proto industry, rural manufacturing

would have competed and perhaps undermined and undermined.

What's the past tense of to undermine undermined.

Yes.

Thank you.

Uh, would have undermined.

Guilds.

Undermined.

I don't know.

Um, anyway.

But in reality, uh, that doesn't happen, right?

So What about the prediction the industry theory makes about

the effect of urban institutions?

Right.

So it says we're urban institutions are strong.

And really guilds for urban institutions should be weak.

So pi, uh, you know, would be working in areas

that have weak city privileges.

Uh, right.

So Flanders, where Mendel's study to develop the theory and

in England, um, but actually merchant capital seeks to maintain

urban production and some medieval towns actually do go vigorously.

So that doesn't work very well either.

So ultimately, we get to this place.

Where does proto industry actually offer us something compelling, something

tangible as a transitionary stage in feudalism and capitalism?

Well, it's not sustained, right?

Where proto industry, structural industry does develop, it often develops

vigorously and then kind of fades away.

Um, it is developed in the 14th century in Italy.

It developed later in England and Flanders.

Uh, so what Mendel's is seeing, which he said is

something new, distinct, unique that emerges in the 17th century,

conveniently right before manufacturing.

Well, actually, it was just a resurgence of something that

had long existed.

Right?

Um, so Pomeranz calls it a, uh, proto industrial cul

de sac.

Right.

Uh, ultimately, regions trade less when they turn to producing

their own textiles, so it doesn't work to boost trade.

Um, and actually, Pomeranz, when he's thinking about this in

the Great Divergence debate, uh, sees this, most importantly, in

the context of, uh, colonies that European powers later developed.

But, um, it kind of fails as a theory of

development.

Right?

And that's probably why Mendel isn't more famous.

But it's actually very good to think with.

It's a unique in it's kind of, uh, one of

these big ideas that can actually be empirically tested.

Although, unfortunately for Mendel's, the testing doesn't come off, uh,

very positively for the idea.

Right.

Um, the I however, returning to the theme I started

off with.

Right.

If I want you to remember nothing else from today,

uh, it's that rural industry is not proto industry, right?

Rural industry is a thing that happened.

And we know it was very useful, uh, for certain

economies, a certain time, to definitely integrate rural workforces into

the secondary sector.

The secondary sector is indeed more productive than agriculture.

So it is important for growth.

It's still key to explanations, right?

It's still key to understanding why northwestern Europe was able

to emerge as the economic leader, uh, rather than the

Mediterranean.

Right.

So it's still very important.

Rural industry is still very important for our broad understanding

of economic development.

It's just not the, like, one shot silver bullet, uh,

set the answer to what created industrialisation.

Thank you.

Yes.

I.

Totally.

Yes.

I, I can't say I was like, oh, you think

you're right.

Because.

I think.

I.

Know.

She did it, I like it.

He went to my table.

That makes I mean.

I want some of this time.

I know that if I leave it, I'll be like

pulling at you, thinking.

I feel like I'm forgetting something.

Just so much running outside.

I do miss this a minute.

What are you seeing?

Your master.

I'm at stake here.

Because.

Of raw materials.

That's one way.

Sign up for.

Okay.

What's interesting is, you know, if I don't do what

you're coming.

I'm.

Just so ill like it.

I mean, I think I need a snack.

I think I need a snack.

I need some energy.

So what do you do?

I don't want to think about it.

It's just that I need to perform.

How?

About halfway, my boy.

How did you do that?

Same thing.

It was like I was on a roll, and I

liked it.

Let's make a message.

That's enough.

Maybe you don't get.

It.

Yeah.

Actually, nothing.

But is this camera?

Yes.

Just.

If I did it.

Yesterday, I did not go.

I was calm, I don't know.

I was like.

Yeah, this is important.

I need to address myself on the stairs to the

gym.

That's the next question.

And there is no way.

To know.

Are.

Those actually for president.

That's the point.

Man.

Mama to Napoleon.

Oh.

We are.

It's just a script that.

Maybe.

You.

Don't.

Like it was like.

21.

Are.

You okay?

Yeah.

I want to talk, but.

And then.

I went to my.

Brother's minister.

Yeah.

Well, I.

Know.

My God.

Yeah, yeah.

Yeah.

Lecture 8:

Yeah.

My dad.

Takes.

A while.

You see me now because I got switched out of

your 1 or 2 class.

Yeah, yeah, I got switched to the new class, just

ironically.

There you go.

I don't know, it's weird.

But it's just an early class.

It's fucking God.

What's with him?

And so.

Is this the thing that you just bought?

Well, yeah.

You'll see.

It looks good.

So you ended up getting.

I even tell you.

Yeah.

You were saying you wanted to go for Napier Black.

Oh, by the sound of it, I thought you would

have gone for black.

No, I had to send it back like twice because

the media like that is going on.

Yeah.

But.

I mean, I always crushed it because I can get,

like, a relatively central.

Industrious family.

Or do you get one?

That I can count on.

And I was like, oh my.

Oh.

No, it's just a second.

Were you at lecture two?

Good night.

Oh, yes.

I was just gonna forget him.

I'm not gonna.

Yeah, I was napping a lot.

It's just like that.

I don't want to catch you.

It's crazy.

Right?

Let me tell you something.

He's not functioning.

I think I can, too.

I'm.

Oh, my.

God!

Really?

Well, what's the problem?

Oh, I'm.

Sorry.

No.

You're good.

You don't go to Christmas.

Yeah.

We'll be good to Christmas, mom.

It's not like there's any location.

That one's that rare.

Which one?

Really?

Which one are you going to?

It's one to me.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Basically a restaurant called Serve Food.

I don't know.

I don't know.

Maybe you're just too nice.

minutes after.

I have an idea.

That's pretty much what you have.

To do?

Yeah.

It's just not right.

Because I have nothing to say.

That was my reaction.

When I saw the picture.

That's what I think.

Somebody kissed me.

Someone Tommy.

Are people okay if they don't give me proper credit?

I just walk away down there.

I can't breathe, I can't see the light.

They're trying to sell water with the cold, hard cash

is always Mr. right.

And we're living in the material.

And I am a material girl.

You know, you're living in a material world, and I

am a material world.

Boys don't mind if I'm born sold.

And that's all I really want is my interest.

And I have to let Melanie.

Come on Giants, I'm on high but I don't wanna

let them play.

It's only for a day that can escape my rainy

day.

Cause they are living in a material world.

And I am on my tail.

You know that we are living in a material world.

And I am a material girl.

Living in the material world.

And I am a material girl.

You know that we are living in a material world.

And I am a material girl.

I'm.

Making a material.

To the material world.

I think in a material world we live in a

material world.

But maybe my boys may go and add.

All right, you see.

Experience has made me rich and all that.

I don't mean to cause everybody's benefit in the material

world.

And I am a material.

Now, you know that we are living in a material

world, and I am a material down.

In the material world.

I do what?

I do.

Uh.

All right.

Uh, anybody know that one?

I feel this was a slam dunk slam song of

the week.

Anybody know this one?

Material girl?

Okay.

And the link to our topic today would be what

do you think?

Consumption.

Right.

Uh, song about consuming stuff.

Materiality.

So last week, we moved out of agriculture into manufacturing.

We talked about urban manufacturing and the institutional implications.

Uh, the kind of governance that we're on, some of

these skills.

Then we went into, uh, rural manufacturing.

Uh, we tried to kind of problematise the artificial binary

between, you know, dynamic towns and, you know, uh, stagnant

countryside by talking about manufacturing that did occur in the

in the countryside.

Right.

So you have a shift from agriculture into manufacturing, you

know, in rural environments.

And then we talked about the institutional implications of that

world by, you know, talking about rural industry is one

thing.

And this theory of, uh, proto industry, uh, which then

we kind of problematise, uh, to death.

Right.

Um, well, now we're going to look at the outcome

of all of this manufacturing, uh, and think about instead

of production, everything we've been talking about so far has

been about production.

Right.

Well, we know, uh, you know, consumption is also important,

right?

Um, was important in the past, uh, is important today.

There's lots of, you know, uh, policy designed to stimulate

consumption, right?

This is the Paul Krugman ideas about my spending or

your wages.

And your wages are my spending, right?

Um, so I'm going to present you with another kind

of historical narrative about patterns of consumption in the modern

world, and that's another theoretical superstructure to grapple with in

the concept of the, uh, industrial revolution.

Right.

So much like last week was a historical phenomenon, rural

industry putting out system, uh, and the theoretical superstructure of

the um profile industry thesis.

This is, you know, similar in terms of we have

a historical phenomenon, consumer revolution.

Right.

People start consuming things, a consumer revolution that is empirically

observable in surviving historical evidence.

The theoretical superstructure is.

The Industrial Revolution is a concept that tries to make

this consumer revolution relevant for trajectories of economic growth.

Right.

Um, so questions.

How do we reconcile consumption patterns that we can observe.

That's the empirical historical kind of, uh, truth.

If you think that there is any kind of historical

truth, um, with, uh, standards of living and economic growth.

Right.

So we can measure this, we can measure this, and

we can kind of measure this.

So how do they move?

Um.

Is the Industrial revolution like the silver bullet answer that

unifies all of these things?

Right.

Um, and then we're going to evaluate it.

Uh, so it's an issue here.

Demand for goods.

Economic growth.

Uh, also, you know, to understand this, we need to

talk a bit about the structures of family economies.

Um, and as with last week, we're trying to or

at least the theory of an industrial revolution is trying

to link what happened in the economies of the early

modern period with the industrialisation that would come later.

Right.

Why are all of these historians that we're talking about

for, you know, uh, weeks desperately trying, uh, to make

the early modern period relevant to later periods?

Right.

Well, because we're all interested in the most fundamental question

of, you know, why some places grow richer quick, more

quickly than others, right?

So if you can find, you know, something further back

in history that explains, uh, the time everything turns on

in terms of industrialisation, then that, uh, you know, would

be good for science, to your knowledge and your career.

Um, see?

Here is a merchant house in the middle of the

16th century.

On the right hand side, you have the same kind

of person, uh, at the end of the 18th century.

Um, what?

You know, do we see, uh, this is the consumer

revolution right now.

I mean, to our 21st century sensibilities.

I'm not sure.

This feels like a whole lot to get excited about.

Um, I mean, if you saw this on Rightmove in

London, it would probably still be a pretty expensive house.

But what are you dealing with here?

Right?

You're dealing with a whole bunch of new stuff.

Uh, you're dealing with, uh, you know, these glass bottles

and whatever is in them, some new, nicer furniture, some

artwork, a mirror.

Uh, early modern people, they love drapes.

Like drinks were something to get really excited about.

Um, but this looks kind of dim and unpleasant.

Uh, and it was not actually that different from the

15th century farmer's cottage that my in-laws live in in

Norfolk.

Right.

Low ceilings, little light.

This is lots of windows.

Uh, lots of light.

Lots of fancy new furniture and lots more stuff.

Um, so this consumer revolution, uh, is I just drawing

a parallel saying that, you know, this is the historical

fact.

Uh, it's less of an observable empirical fact than the

existence of the putting out system is because it is

a term kind of coined by an historian.

Um, but it is pretty widely acknowledged and, as we'll

see, observable in historical evidence.

Um, but it's a demand side story, right?

Uh, that should explain why, uh, manufacturing grew so much

because we had to have demand increasing as well.

It's a bit of a chicken or egg problem.

Right.

Which came first?

But that's the idea of the commercial revolution, right.

So you get a whole bunch of new stuff, not

just the stuff I've shown you, but also watches, uh,

chairs, prints of artwork, curtains.

All of these things turn up in probate inventories, right?

That's what I think.

Empirically observable probate inventories are the lists of things that

existed in the house the people houses, the people that

died.

Uh, and in order to distribute their wealth and sometimes,

you know, be taxed by the state.

This often gets recorded.

So we know, you know, right back into the late

medieval period.

How many beds, how many blankets, how many spoons people

had.

Right.

Uh, and we just see an explosion of new goods,

uh, in, um, you know, the 17th and 18th century.

Um, the sources are biased.

All sources are, uh, and also, you have to be

relatively wealthy in order for it to be worthwhile for

anybody to probate your will.

So this might only be an explosion in the goods

owned by rich people.

But recent evidence unearthed by, uh, my colleague Chris Briggs

at Cambridge kind of shows, uh, that you can see

poor people getting probated as well.

Um, so that's durable goods things for your house, right?

Um, but there's also increased consumption in food commodities.

Right.

Uh, and this is in many instances facilitated by European

voyages to the Americas, which are kind of a late,

early modern phenomenon.

Right.

But you see how much sugar people are consuming per

capita, uh, in the middle of the 17th century.

It's £2 per person.

Um, by the end of the 18th century, it's £24,

right?

Rum is why.

Why is rum besides sugar?

Anybody know?

Anybody know their spirits?

What do they have in common?

Yeah.

Rome is distilled from sugar cane.

Right.

So also coming from the West Indies.

Uh, I mean, I shudder to think about what our

per capita sugar cane.

Somebody Google.

What, like 21st century per capita sugar consumption is, and

whoever finds it, put up your hand.

I want to see how it compares, because that'll be

very interesting.

But it skyrockets, right?

Um, my money is on, uh, the over here.

Um, anybody got this yet?

Yeah.

22kg.

Okay, so now we need to know, like, how many

pounds are in a kilogram?

2.2.

Okay, so £48.5 of sugar a year for a person.

Oh, yeah.

Okay.

Um, I hope all of you guys are on the

under there.

Um, but.

Okay.

Anyway, other things, not entirely obvious, but like pharmaceuticals, drugs.

Uh, this comes from my colleague Patrick's work, right?

They actually blow up as well.

So things for people to spend their money on.

There's many new things to spend your money on.

Um, now, there are questions about whether this is a

European phenomenon exclusively, or if it is a pan Eurasian

phenomenon.

This comes from the work of Pomeranz Wright, where he

looks at Europe and then he looks at Europe without

Britain and Britain on its own.

So it does seem to be something that is happening.

Uh, consumption is increasing more quickly in Britain than in

other places, but it's still essentially doubling.

Um, but obviously, you know, the Brits really, really like

sugar.

Um, and actually, you know, China here is outpacing um.

Europe at the same period.

Okay.

Uh, we could do this for the Ottoman Empire.

Uh, what is the literature on this?

Well, this, you know, uh, industrial revolution, much like for

who?

Industry is such a provocative thesis as.

we'll see that many people have then built their careers

on investigating whether its premise the premise holds in other

instances.

So this comes from one of our own PhD students

who looked at durable goods.

That's going to be like these household things, uh, in

the Ottoman world and finds that it, uh, increases as

well.

So varying levels.

Right.

But at least across Eurasia, consumption is increasing.

Um, so we might ask, you know, is this a

mass consumer society?

People talk about the 20th and 21st centuries as being

like a consumer society.

Uh, this is a question similar to, you know, was

the pre-industrial world globalised?

Um, well, it's going to depend how you define globalisation.

It's going to depend how you define consumer society.

But there's some interesting things to look at right up

to, 40% of people, uh, old watches in the middle

of the 18th century.

Um, watches are like, uh, I mean, really, really interesting,

intricate, uh, difficult technology to reproduce.

Uh, people still covet watches, actually.

You can spend all sorts of money on watches these

days.

Um, but we have to actually ask you what utility,

what kind of incentivise an individuals to invest in these

goods, right.

Uh, why all of a sudden do you have people,

uh, buying things that they've never bought before?

I said it's a chicken or egg argument.

Is it because there's new things and when it appears

people want them?

Or is it because incomes rose and all of a

sudden there was surplus income to spend and that kind

of incentivises the production of new goods, right.

This is where we get the historical conundrum that this

industrial revolution, uh, situation tries to solve, because we start

here and we look at real wages.

Can somebody tell me what a real wage is as

opposed to a nominal wage?

Yeah, just a translation.

Adjusted for inflation.

Yes.

But adjusting for inflation happens in the process of adjusting

for something else, which is what anybody anybody know.

That's a by-product as well.

It's a real.

Yeah.

It's based on what.

Yes.

It's nominal wages, what you earn divided by the cost

of living which then also controls for inflation.

Right.

Because like as we know London is very expensive.

I'm from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada.

Right.

Uh, and, you know, whatever £15 an hour buys a

hell of a lot more in Canada than it does

in my hometown of Canada than it does in London.

So that's what a real wages anyway.

But what this shows and, you know, this is Bob

Dylan's work the compares the real wages, you know, so

varying levels of wages and varying costs of living.

But some important trends here.

Uh, real wages climb uh, in the late medieval period,

especially after the Black Death.

But then at the height, you know, our heights in

kind of 1450, 1500 and a lot of places, they

are stagnating or declining.

Right.

Um, this is unskilled workers, right?

This is skilled workers.

Uh, so the reason, um, this is such a puzzle

and it's kind of this chicken or egg problem.

We know consumption Increases are based upon the inventories of

goods that we have, the historical evidence we have of

what people are buying.

Right.

This might be proxied by goods that are imported.

It might be measured by the goods that dead people

left in their houses.

But by and large, we can be pretty confident that

consumption across a range of goods, be it sugar, be

it watches, whatever it's going on, um, however real wages

and, you know, you can extrapolate productivity, um, from real

wages stagnate.

Right.

So ultimately the purchasing power of people is going down.

Right.

And what happens when purchasing power goes down?

Leisure time goes down.

Uh, because you have to work more in order to

buy the stuff you need or you want.

Uh, and leisure time is down because working time goes

up.

Um, so the problem is consumption increases.

But, you know, in a way it's almost inversely proportionate

to income.

So that is a real puzzle, right?

How could why do people consume more when their incomes

are going down?

Entry on degrees, right.

Uh, he looks at consumer behaviour and the household economy,

uh, from the 17th century to the present.

And he thinks he has a very elegant solution to

this historical conundrum.

Right.

It doesn't really make much sense.

Now, a, uh, was not a term that was coined

by uh, de Vries.

Uh, as with most things in the academic world.

Uh, you can trace the roots of this term further

back.

Kind of, you know, it's an iterative process.

You might say, standing on the shoulders of giants.

But, uh, anyway, John de Vries says, uh, drawing on

this 1967 work that in a specific historical period, in

a specific place emerged a new form of economic behaviour

at the household level and this behaviour behavioural paradigm.

You could call it a meme in the Dawkins sense,

uh became very, very influential and spreads very, very quickly.

Right.

Um, and what this does is simultaneously increases the supply

of production.

And the demand, uh, for this is important abroad but

indiscriminate range of consumer goods.

So to summarise all of that, the industrial revolution, which

is the theoretical superstructure that sits atop what we observe

and call the consumer revolution and the increases in consumption

is a demand side explanation that's rooted in the behaviour

of households and then this behaviour at the household level

goes on to affect supply.

So remember industrial revolution?

I said this is a chicken or egg argument.

Um, debris thinks the causality works one way right.

Demand behaviour on the demand side changes and then that

then affects supply okay.

So basically families want to buy more stuff.

We can blame them.

Uh, so they then work harder.

What are they doing?

Well, you know, uh, in our you can see where

rural industry links up here.

They might work harder on marketable goods to sell.

Right.

Maybe when they finished farming, they're doing some weaving or

whatever, you know.

So I'm going to weave or spin some more string

when I'm, you know, done carrying the harvest in order

for me to be able to earn more money so

I can buy more.

And then there's a reciprocal kind of virtuous cycle.

This has the effect of producing more consumer goods that

others can then buy.

Uh, according to The Freeze, the drivers of this process

are commercial incentives and changes in tastes.

Right now, a lot of this behaviour, uh, is proxy

by wage evidence, right?

Wages are some of the best information we have to

proxy a range of economic indicators.

Uh, you know, the work.

I'm engaged in myself, but basically you can see in

real wages of, uh, labourers, you know, on to GDP

data.

So GDP is circles, uh, the impact, um, of, you

know, that people are, uh, earning um, is in the

diamonds here, right?

So basically wages are high, right?

In the medieval period.

The argument would be wages are high and people have

nothing to buy.

Right.

Stylised world of the medieval period is not very much

interesting stuff to buy.

So what do you spend your money on?

Food, right.

But you can only consume so much food and it's

not even very interesting food.

Uh, so, you know, uh, you might, you know, and

there's only so much bread you can eat.

So then maybe you shift your preferences to higher quality

foods, start consuming some cheese and some meat, but you

can only meat, you know, eat so much.

There's not very effective ways to save.

Um, and there's not, you know, that many consumer goods

to buy.

So then eventually you just opt to stop working.

Right.

There's nothing for me to work for.

So I have a preference for leisure.

I work, you know, 120 days a year.

That takes care of me and my family.

And, you know, when the limited things we can buy.

Uh, and then we just stopped working.

So everybody has a preference for leisure because wages are

high and there's nothing to buy.

What changes after this dip?

Uh, in living standards.

And you see it stagnates here.

Right.

It stagnates here.

But this is the puzzle.

Uh, it's the GDP is increasing.

Right.

So consumption and GDP are correlated here.

All of a sudden GDP starts going up, production starts

going up, productivity starts going up.

At the same time the wages remain stagnant.

Well, what is the difference here.

Right.

You could draw a line somewhere here on you know,

if we could get you on the breeze in the

room, he would probably pinpoint it somewhere.

Um, that tastes change and the availability of consumer goods

increases.

So now there's sugar.

Now there's nice drapes.

Now there's tobacco.

All of this stuff.

More stuff to spend your money on.

So you decide you and your family in life to

work harder.

No longer do we have a preference for leisure.

We have a preference for earning, for consumption.

Right?

That's the idea.

Why do we emphasise the fact that this works at

the level of the family economy?

Right.

Why is that important?

Well, imagine the stylised world where a household produces a

set of goods.

Whatever they produce depends on the technology that they have

and the time that they have.

Goods can be produced in a variety of ways.

Right.

So the household makes the decision about how to allocate

its labour in its time.

Um, so determined by taste, technology and preferences for leisure

shaped decisions of how to use the household's resources.

But then to point here that, you know, Greg and

I will ultimately absolutely call you out on, on your

paper.

So I have to like me a couple myself here.

Uh, should be an apostrophe there.

Um, so you want more, and therefore you work more.

This creates an industrial revolution.

Um, and it's essentially self exploitation, right?

It's self exploitation.

Uh, because men are forced to labour because they're slaves

to their own desires.

Right.

Um, and I'm sure we're all familiar with that.

Uh, and the the the household level.

Right.

Because they might, you know, make their wives and their

children work harder, too.

So we're moving from a world where market for the

home.

Right.

Uh, is a larger part of your time a little

bit for the market, most for your home because there's

nothing to buy, so you're just working for as long

as you need to buy the staples and then taking

some time off, uh, whereas then we shift into a

world where people are spending more of their time producing

for the market because they want to, uh, buy more

stuff.

So there's a shift, right from an industrious to a

breadwinner homemaker model that occurs later.

This is like 200 years or so after the degrees

kind of paradigm shift.

Uh, so this industrial revolution is kind of only temporary.

Uh, ultimately, you know, in the 19th century, 101 world,

um, women and children then leave the workforce.

Uh, households are funded entirely by male wages, and they

seek a new set of domestic goods.

Right.

So this is only relevant for a short period of

time.

But the elegance, Uh, and the reason for this persistence

is a historical, theoretical, historical idea is that this industrial

revolution gets us from the early modern period to this

period of industrialisation, much like proto industry did.

Right?

Um, so does this explain why the Industrial Revolution occurs

only in some regions of Europe?

Again, we encounter this demographic paradigm of the European marriage

pattern.

Right?

Maybe we need to think about flexible nuclear families in

the European context, whose labour can be effectively allocated and

moulded by a head of household right, versus less flexible

extended families that predominate in, uh, Eurasia, other parts of

Eurasia and Asia itself, whose labour can't be so easily,

uh, redirected.

Right.

Okay.

So that is the theory, right?

It's very similar to the kind of schema.

Last week we observed something in the historical evidence historian

comes along.

I was going to say eminent historian.

In both cases, they weren't eminent until they had this

thesis.

A historian comes along elegantly, links the historical phenomenon to

a later period that we know is important for the

development of economies.

It sounds very sexy.

Explains everything right.

Links the early modern period with the industrial period that

we all know led to modern economic growth and therefore

like places.

I mean, I like these theories like proto industry and

an industrial revolution because it pushes the antecedents of modern

economic growth back much earlier than uh, industrialisation.

Right.

Which, you know, gives Greg and I at least like

some kind of traction in terms of explaining the relevance

of the work we do.

Um, but what do we need to do next?

Right.

We need to interrogate it with evidence, much like proto

industry.

We need to look at all of the individual parts

and say to any, is this hold up to historical

scrutiny?

Does anybody have any questions about the theory, uh, industriousness,

how it works.

Now?

Yeah.

So problems with the evidence?

Well, it's very, very difficult to find evidence on preferences.

This degrees argument about an industrial revolution hinges on the

fact that people's tastes changed.

Right.

And I showed you those two pictures of a merchant's

house.

So we can infer from that that tastes change, but

there's very little evidence, um, for what people's preferences were.

So here's an interesting example.

Right?

A question.

I mean, because in the second year you have to

do a research project in year two, three, seven and

third year you'll do a dissertation on something to do

with economic history.

We need to start thinking about where we're going to

find the evidence we need to do so.

I'm asking you to speculate, but let's brainstorm a bit.

Where would you look in the historical record if you

wanted to find some evidence on the preference consumption preferences

individuals had?

What do you think?

Anybody have any ideas?

There's no wrong answers here.

Yeah.

Tax record.

Tax records okay.

What are tax records going to tell you?

Do you think um I mean there's lots of tax

collector.

The means probably means that a lot of goods are

being bought.

So for a change of shifting goods, people buy across

low periods.

So what are you thinking this tax data might have

in it?

Just income numbers.

And you're going to infer higher incomes mean higher consumption.

I mean if the tax is larger this is bigger.

I mean it means more goods are being bought.

Right I suppose is that does that mean you think

about individual income tax?

Are you thinking about other forms of tax just like

the political regime or the collect?

Okay.

So we could look at the things that are being

taxed.

We could look at how much tax and we could

kind of use it as a proxy for consumption.

Um, that might tell us levels.

It might not tell us about specific preferences, but the

tax idea is not at all wrong.

Right.

So in at certain points, uh, in the evil period,

tax was based on the stuff that you owned and

few records survive, you know, up until 1332.

In medieval England, there's like 33 sets of documents that

tell you about what all of the things that a

peasant house, all of the peasant households own.

So, yeah, tax information could tell us about what people

own and therefore reveal preferences.

Yeah.

Records.

Do they have to be broken?

Up.

Yeah.

So guilds who are doing the manufacturing.

Look at this.

Look at what's being supplied rather than what's being demanded.

And if we assume that people are supplying what people

wanted, then yes, that would be good, right?

Uh.

What else?

Yeah.

Um, kind of traditional to build brackets, but, like, uh,

margin is being important.

Yeah.

So we can look at customs records.

Right?

This is a gun of another tax idea.

We can see what's being imported.

Look at quantities.

Right.

How much wine is coming in?

Is there a new.

There's a new tax on something.

Uh, then we could assume that there was demand for

it just coming in, and that would be revealed preferences.

This is good.

Let's have some more.

This is possible for the time, but, like, you know,

when they measure inflation.

A basket of goods.

Mm.

So maybe using that kind of data to look at

that certain basket.

Yeah.

So that's the CPI basket right.

That's that's what's used to deflate a real wage we're

talking about earlier.

Absolutely.

So historians go around and try to figure out exactly

what people were consuming.

So if you looked at all of the sources we

need to look at and construct, the different, uh, baskets

are good for different eras.

It would reveal changes in preferences.

This is actually one of the core problems with CPI

deflator that we use.

And I'll talk about this, is that the most common

deflating basket of goods remains static from 1100 to 1850.

Right.

It assumes that people's preferences didn't change.

That's one of the big methodological problems.

Let's have some other ideas.

There's got to be some more here.

We can go even broader.

Yeah.

Um, agricultural, like farming data.

Like what kind of food was produced or.

Like.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

More production records.

Let's let's shift over to the demand side.

Let's be a bit more esoteric.

What kind of records do humans produce?

Right.

That might survive, that might reveal preferences.

What do you think?

Yeah.

Possibly like diary or journal entries.

Yeah.

Diaries.

Right.

Like, you know, I'm really, really saving up for this

nice glass bottle.

Like another three years, I might be able to buy

it, you know, just reveals preferences.

Absolutely.

What else do you like?

Well, well, like things that people like leave to other

people when they die.

Yeah.

Which is similar to like these probate records.

But yeah, that would show the consumption side of it

as well.

Good good good.

I'm getting some other ones.

Any other ideas before we move on?

Yeah.

Data in terms of like how many children were like

what the population was working so that like, you understand

how much disposable income they have.

Yeah.

We could use this theory, flip it on its head

to show, like, the, uh, productive capacity of a family

unit would give us some information on this.

Letters are a good one.

Right?

Before emails, people wrote lots of letters to themselves.

Maybe somebody like Lucy.

My daughter loves Paddington.

Aunt Lucy's in my.

Anyway, Lucy.

Like, I'm really saving up for this nice glass bottle.

Can you, you know, give me some money for my

birthday?

Anyway, a little, little, little sidetrack there, but it's good

to start thinking about these things early.

There's a whole range of evidence to use.

Um, so little relating from precedent on preferences, because not

enough historians have gone and collected enough evidence from all

the sources we just discussed to give us concrete evidence

on what it's it's an elusive, uh, historical phenomenon.

Right.

Um, so hopefully one of you goes on to become

the most pre-eminent historian on early modern consumer preferences.

After after today.

Um, the other thing that we need to look for

is that a shift from self-sufficiency, right?

Cottage industry to market production affects women more directly than

it does men.

Um, because domestic goods end up being replaced by market

goods.

Um.

Well, the problem is most data on household possessions that

we have actually aren't consumables.

So we need to think a little bit about what

we can measure, right?

Um, well, most here there's more evidence on the labour

inputs that are the other side of this dynamic than

the actual consumables.

Right.

So this comes from what's early work, right?

Where he looks at how much time people are working.

What does he find?

Well, that there is an increase, right?

Uh, and he's looking here at London, in the south

of England and in the north of England, which, as

we know, in the 21st century, you know, are still

are two fundamentally different economies in a lot of ways.

Um, but what he and the North is also where

industrialisation later happens, which is why he's looking at this.

But basically he's finding, yes, people are working more.

So is that evidence for an industrial revolution?

Right?

Um, we should go bring all sorts of people together,

uh, all sorts of studies from the late medieval period

to the present.

And we should see, do see an increase in the

amount of time working.

And actually, there does seem to be, you know, a

bit earlier than John DeVries, but it does seem to

happen around the same time that we know these new

goods start coming online.

right?

Um, there are problems with this because if you really

dig down into the evidence and I'm going to show

you one example here, uh, the data that undergirds a

lot of these estimates is sometimes questionable, uh, because it's

very hard to measure the length of the working year.

Um, and a lot of people are still working on

this.

So some historians have been forced to make assumptions, right,

that most people will work.

Some assume 250 days a year, others assume 260 days

a year.

Yet another historian assumes 300 days a year.

Uh, and what they'll do is, is just like, uh,

you know, five equals ten over two kind of equation.

If you want to find one component, you just isolate

and solve for the other.

So a lot of these estimates on the number of

days worked is just linked to what people are earning

with a fixed assumption about how many days are work.

So a lot of these estimates about the length of

the working year are derived from wages, rather than direct

estimates of what people are doing.

That's a problem.

Um, and if you're looking at day labour.

Right.

That graph I showed you earlier comes from the work

of Humphreys and one staff and I plotted.

Look, this would be a leisure preference.

This would be the industrial revolution.

Well, those dots, those connect the dots.

That's day labour, right?

And what does it assume?

Well, hot day labour.

Uh, wages were high and therefore people would work less.

Right.

What is the problem here is that we don't know

if people actually could string together, you know, enough days

of labour in order to pay for their wage, right?

It's a problem.

Um, and you could look at this here, right?

Uh, this comes to the work of Humphreys and Wise

Dorf as well.

And I'll just give you one very self-indulgent medieval example.

Um, this is somebody that they think works for a

whole year, right?

Um, but unfortunately, they relied on, uh, a poor translation

of this Latin source that basically says, I could put

Greg on the spot here and ask him to read

this.

Um, this is obviously a typo.

This should be stipend, which is the, you know, Latin

word they used for wage.

Stupid.

Must be what you pay a really ineffective labourer.

But anyway, so it says this dairy made in wages

of the dairy in summer.

Right.

Three shillings.

So only seasonal wage.

Uh, later on they get some grain, but it says,

uh.

So they earn some cash.

They earn some grain.

The great thing is even more complicated because they work

from, uh, the feast of Saint Michael, which is.

Michaelmas, which is September 29th.

Now we'll see if Greg remembers his feast.

Farewell to the Purification of Blessed Mary, which is six

months later.

Well done.

Uh, up until the second day, beyond the Ides of

April.

Up till.

Anyway, the point is, they don't work for the whole

year, so, you know, you can really, if you start

drilling down on a lot of these estimates that have

been derived by proxies, you see that we maybe need

to think a little bit more carefully about be critical

of this evidence that seems to show an increase in

the number of days worked and therefore undergirds this industrial

revolution.

We need to be sceptical of the evidence.

Um, that's not your job.

Uh, today might become your job in the future.

Uh, so, anyway, um, you can add all this stuff

together.

It's not an annual contract for this person.

They work for almost 100 days, less than a year.

Um, another thing we can look at is entry to

the workforce.

Right?

Uh, that is going down from the 16th century to

the 19th century.

Right.

That should show the same thing, right?

People are working more, and that has a spill-over effect

or knock on effect of, uh, labourers who are working

in this guild system.

So these are the age of apprentices from guilds in

London that are entering the kind of, uh, manufacturing, urban

manufacturing guild regulated workforce.

Right?

Their age is going down, which suggests basically that labouring

is going up.

Um, so in the remaining few minutes through a similar,

you know, uh, exercise to what we did last week

in trying to sum up evaluating this really, really elegant

theory of industrial revolution, um, similar to how we investigate

a approach to industry and ask, okay, first, does this

consumer revolution really exist?

And if the consumer revolutions exist, why do we need

an industrial revolution?

Right?

What does it do?

Um, this is where I explain how the concept of

a consumer revolution is not as concrete as the concept

of manufacturing in the countryside that I talked about last

week.

Because it is a bit a bit of a, um,

in or, you know, artefact of historical, uh, historians itself.

But anyway, one of the things is, is that all

of this could just be driven by prices in some

ways, right?

The consumption looks like a real increase in expenditure, right?

Shifting from spending on your house to your market, or

does it simply represent falling prices and a shift to

cheaper substitutes?

Right.

All of this could be explained by prices.

Uh, and you can see the range of consumable goods

are available, like at all sorts of price levels.

So substitution is clearly possible.

Technological change.

Right.

As a concept, we've talked about lots in this course.

We haven't tried to link it here yet.

Um, maybe consumption patterns simply reflect technical change.

Uh, because it wasn't so much that people were willing

to work harder in order to produce goods.

De Vries this model is kind of a model of

technical stagnation.

Um, and this would reverse the causality of what Greece

talks about, right?

Maybe it's just technology improved with that, improved technology, a

greater range and of higher quality goods were available at

more reasonable prices.

That's what technology does.

Right.

And instead of, you know, this would mean that the

demand is supply driven, right.

What about inequality?

A lot of this evidence for a consumer revolution that

we have is drawn from imperfect sources, as we just

discussed.

Right.

And maybe we're only measuring the increasing consumption of a

strata, some strata of the population not representative of the

whole society.

Right.

So a growing elite consumer class consume more, um, and

the poor ends up being forced into the market, uh,

maybe because they've lost the means of subsistence, like we

talked about earlier in the year with enclosure and the

encroachment of urbanisation.

Right.

So we have all of these things like crisis, technology

inequality, they're, uh, phenomena that we can observe across Eurasia.

Right.

Are there any better explanations than changing family structure?

Right.

That's for us to evaluate.

Um.

Do we need an industrial revolution?

So the time spent working does seem to increase in

Britain, right?

I think there's probably enough evidence of that that even

though I have quibbles about the data that underlies some

of these estimates, there's so many estimates, they all kind

of point in the same direction.

I think we can be reasonably certain that at least

in Britain, time spent working does increase.

Um, but in order for this industrial Revolution thesis to

work, people have to be working more because their preferences

changed.

And as we talked about, preferences are the one thing

that we don't really have good empirical evidence for.

So how do we know increased, um, time spent working

is a direct result of a shift in preferences?

Or is it simply a response to declining real incomes?

Right.

Uh, and a shift in relative prices that made consumer

goods cheaper than food.

And you know what?

There's like the hamster that you give it, like, either

hit this lever and get some food, or hit this

lever and get some kind of stimulation.

Right.

We all know our phones give us, like, dopamine hit.

Who here has bought something nice for themselves and then

like, persisted on cheap food for the rest of the

month, right?

I have definitely done that.

Uh, myself.

Um, I have a preference for, uh, Gibson les Paul's

of a certain vintage, um, and.

Yeah.

So that is the question we need to answer as

we go.

Industry last week, I leave it to you to, uh,

evaluate how convincing, uh, you think it is.

Thank you.

So, uh, one one note.

Um, I think you all the email, uh, you all

know that we created a fifth class.

Um, and you check your timetables to see if you've

been moved into a new class.

And if you've been moved into a new class, it

means you have to submit your essays on a new

link.

Oh, wait.

Oh, you did that.

I'm in the class.

Are you?

Yeah.

But you know my students.

Did you go to the board we just mentioned?

Yeah, my time to go.

Look, I just popped up on.

My phone at a different.

Time.

I mean, it's the.

Same teacher, so I said.

You're staying in my class.

You didn't get.

It?

No, no I don't.

You know.

I I'm hopefully they didn't tell me.

Where is everybody?

Some of them have been moved out to different classes,

but.

That's about it.

I'm thinking, why would you need an extension?

Because the link on Moodle has a shutdown.

So if you missed that, it won't let you submit

it.

But if you need it.

I might as well.

I know what I'm doing.

I like it.

Where are you?

I have.

185.

Uh, what's your mood like?

Oh.

It was.

Awful.

I know what goes into.

You need to know that.

You know that's a trick.

What's wrong with me?

Um, the 101.

You like?

You?

Yeah.

I know you're really what I did.

It's absolutely nothing.

It.

Was actually incredible.

Look at this.

She spent three hours.

Oh my goodness.

Yeah.

Um.

Um.

Okay.

Okay.

And.

The noise.

Um.

That's.

Ah, there it is.

Fantastic.

What was on the menu today.

Lecture 9:

I'm crazy.

Something's up.

Did you check your email?

Yeah.

In fact, I'll check it again.

Oh, cancel.

And so did my next lecture.

That's The email.

A 10 a.m..

Okay.

Let's do.

That now.

Thank you.

I.

Feel like such an idiot.

How did how did.

There's, like, usually 80 people.

That means out of 80 people.

I'm the only talk that didn't show up that that

showed up.

Sorry.

Am I like, am I like, slow?

Like.

Thank you.

Really?

Thank you.

Almost miss the editor's acceptance.

I want to talk.

With you.

I.

Just said.

I feel like a dumb.

Like.

Let me just check your.

Scale.

It's like I wonder if they cancel, like, maybe 20

minutes before.

Maybe I don't want to be around to.

Uh, to pop up in the car.

You just don't want to come.

It's kind of crazy.

You have to save yourself online.

I've been.

Calling me.

You can watch lost.

Watching lost tonight, buddy.

Awesome music being recorded.

Okay.

Okay.

Bye bye.

Right now.

Now.

So you.

God.

Thanks.

How many?

People.

Yeah.

In this elevator.

I mean, maybe you should be going to the lobby

with these kind of things.

But maybe.

That's.

Why they.

Have this thing.

Up.

This.

Okay.

You.

I'm going to do it again.

Somewhere in the house.

Yes.

Uh.

Yes.

I am not sure is.

Could.

Say.

Yeah.

I.

Like it's like 60%.

Yeah.

You know what?

I think.

What's going on?

Not only do I not know you.

Lecture 10:

Thank you.

Can.

I.

Help you?

Come on.

Yeah.

What happened?

What happened?

I was outside for too long.

Look.

Oh.

How are you taking your coat?

That's the problem.

Yeah, I know, but this is kind of a code

for a fashion.

I should have warned you.

I was coming where I was at the time, but

I just had to talk to my phone.

So I said, what do you say?

I live on Saturday.

And when I say.

So I went ice skating yesterday because we were wondering

that I wouldn't share.

Only one of my friends went to 101 chat.

And have you got no.

Choice.

But we had burgers, so.

Yeah.

No.

Are they okay?

Because I'm usually not big on things because I don't

like the fake.

Like I'm fine with me is disgusting.

I'm fine with the veggie forward.

But the fake news, I'm disgusted.

Um.

It was a £10 burger.

Okay, wait.

Which is quite good.

That's a good one.

I get that.

I was, like, £18.

I know, but there's a place near Roseburg.

Actually, there's a lot of really nice, um, and it's

like £50 without fries.

Yeah.

So this is.

Like.

And.

Yeah.

I hadn't eaten since that was so, um.

What did you like?

Oh my God.

It's.

So crazy.

Like, I know most of my friends just do this,

right?

I'm like.

to.

Have some kind of.

Average of five hours.

And I want to touch.

Yeah.

So like this morning I went to set up for

this morning.

Yeah.

That's probably just a way last night to not do.

It either.

Because we were both like.

Did you guys make this?

I did, I went to a fair.

I did get some money to, like, make my life.

That's the thing I was going on about that.

So things got screwed.

I was like, pretty fair.

Like, you need.

I would go, but no, I just don't want to

spend that kind of money.

So good.

You know, I learned this thing, which is like the

last time I did.

You get.

So I spent.

Exactly.

I mean.

Oh, when you do it.

Yeah.

Oh, yeah.

I was.

I'm.

Not sure.

Yeah.

It's like we went on a week.

No.

Which one is this?

Not.

Yeah.

Yeah, yeah.

I didn't check box.

We could have, like, a 33% chance to get it

right.

You have a great time that you went out the

door, and then I got to when you were leaving.

I just got these percentages right.

I realised that I think obviously what you're talking about

there.

Was it.

Yes.

No, no.

But all my friends.

I.

Know you can come a.

Long day.

I feel like our.

Almost like dropped off.

I mean.

It's not.

Like.

That.

Yeah.

It's delicious.

Oh, quality.

It depends.

No, it's.

Just.

We have so delicious.

It's just.

It's that bad.

I mean, to be honest, we have, but we don't

have ovens.

Yeah.

Yeah.

So when we cook, um.

So we made it just like you.

Oh, yeah.

On Monday night.

Tuesday, Tuesday we went to.

Show you this place.

Um.

I'll just get started quickly.

First order.

Of business.

Uh, is that, uh.

I know some of you have done this already.

If you haven't already, could I please ask you to

fill out, uh, the course survey?

Uh, gives me a really good opportunity to, uh, take

the pulse of all of you.

Uh, see what you're liking.

See what you're not liking.

Um, and so you can scan the QR code.

I sent a reminder about an hour ago, so it

should be something in your email.

So if you don't mind doing that, uh, for the

first couple minutes.

Uh, well, our, uh.

Oh.

My God, you.

Know so many of us.

You know the Spanish armada.

Armada?

Armada?

This armada has got a whole lot of push.

I can't really touch down the barrel.

Yeah, I just got to go.

Condition is treason is treason.

The rights of the San Andreas.

I shouldn't, you know.

I didn't go there.

I went.

Can you hear me, dear Pablo?

No I didn't.

Yes.

I was in.

The area.

And I lost my.

Ring because we were watching.

Now I'm hearing.

You did all right.

Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

I forgot.

I was in.

The same place.

There's more lives together.

How do.

I how do I lose 1 to.

1?

Good woman.

I love.

You.

I left her.

Just one time.

Too many.

I'd lost that dame Now.

The wind and the wheels.

And the waves are crashing.

A crashing, a crashing as high as a house.

Upon the house where I had breakfast I have a

storm.

She is lashing, is lashing.

Is lashing out hard against tyranny.

Coward.

Dude, my greatest love cause.

I hear of great riches.

Great.

Richard.

Richard.

They are not very.

Heroes.

It's just that.

right?

You've heard of.

This?

Oh, yeah.

Oh, yeah.

Basically, it's the cheapest.

Way to get out.

I don't.

Know.

I don't know.

I don't like it.

All right.

So that was the song about the Spanish Armada.

Any guesses about what the relevance to our lecture of

the week is?

Trade.

Overseas trade, I think.

I think it's a reasonably good one.

Uh, okay.

Uh, so everybody done?

We're mostly done with the survey counting heads.

Okay, fantastic, so I can't.

You said there's a review, uh, at the end of

term.

So, uh, I think we should reward ourselves with some

sugar.

Uh, we've got the red ones.

The celebrations.

Please open them.

Pass them around.

You.

There is a right and.

A wrong choice in terms of which bucket you dip

into.

So I mean.

If you get a crunchy or a whisper.

Okay, well, let's, uh, you know, take one pass around.

Uh.

Like.

We want to talk about trade and market integration today.

Right.

So this is one of the main avenues of economic

growth.

Uh, we've alluded to it, uh, in a number of

previous lectures, but this is the first one we're going

to go into in depth.

Right.

This is broken in the second sense through trade and

specialisation.

What I want to talk about today is trying to

cover the historical narrative, provide a couple vignettes, uh, about

trade, uh, the process of Integration, the establishment and reinforcement

of new trading networks in the Middle Ages.

Um, and talking about integration.

Go back in time.

Um, talk about, you know, the goods that were exchanged

over long distance, basically going back to the Middle Ages.

And even before you can see an array of goods

being transmitted, transmitted, exchanged over long distances, right.

I think the interesting question for us to ask is,

is this globalisation right.

If we know a whole bunch of things, we're being

traded over most of the known world.

Can we then say that the pre-industrial world was globalised?

Right.

And then we might ask, depending on how you answer

this question, how one way to find globalisation.

I think an interesting question here is what is or

is globalisation a modern phenomenon or not?

So we have discussed change right through technology growth that

can be very slow to take home.

Right.

You probably talked about GPT and E 101.

Sometimes they take like 100 years to have effect, uh,

investment based growth.

And like the flow of incense relatively low in the

pre-industrial period.

So we want to talk about division of labour and

gains from trade that, you know, you're looking to the

neoclassical, uh, theory there.

You're looking for Smith.

Um, the idea here is the larger the market, the

more chances there are for producers to specialise and more

producers who specialise, the more productive they become.

Right?

That's 15 growth.

Um, why is trade important?

Uh, in a couple of weeks we'll talk and you'll

read about the fundamental problem of exchange.

Uh, but, you know, if we want to touch on

a little bit of game theory, here is only going

to take place.

Both parties can end up better off, right?

Uh, if there's no barriers to trade exchange to continue

until nobody can improve their position anymore.

Pareto optimality.

Right.

The other thing trade does is it exchange.

It directs resources to where they're needed most.

Right.

This is what we call allocative efficiency.

Does anybody play Settlers of Catan?

I think it might just be simply called Catan now.

Hands up if you played it.

Uh, yes.

So, uh, trade is very important to this game.

Um, I mean, I think we should maybe get together

as a group and try to have a big game

of Catan because it really drives home this lecture right

in the pre-industrial period.

Why might trade be difficult?

Well, the big.

One would be trust, especially over long distances.

Right.

Uh, how do you know that?

uh, the agent you're sending to a distant land is

telling the truth about, uh, the market.

They found the prices that were paid, etc., etc..

That, I mean, remains a problem today.

You can imagine it was much more significant in the

pre-industrial period.

Exchange over time and space is difficult.

You're thinking about, you know, uh, oceanic shipping.

You're talking about maybe investing your life savings or the

life savings of several people into one boat that's going

to be gone.

And you're just hoping that, you know, your ship will

come in, um, how you might ensure compliance with contracts

over space and time.

You know, this is we're having a great article on

the Maghreb traders in the early medieval period.

So influential talks about institutions that get developed to ensure

compliance with contracts, um, and that nobody reneges, uh, on

a deal.

Right.

Um, unit two currency.

Right.

Uh, I mean, we're all familiar now, if we try

to shop on, you know, eBay or from other countries

since Brexit, that foreign exchange can be a problem or

a barrier to trade.

I mean, I think there's some new EU regulations coming

in now that are going to make it significantly more

difficult for UK producers to sell stuff to people anyway.

This becomes even bigger problem in the medieval period, right?

You have hundreds of different currencies and they're all moving

against each other.

How do you keep track of that?

That's a barrier to trade.

Uh, language, which is like the modern trade literature we

might call like a non-tariff barrier.

Um, that's going to be a problem as well.

You have lots of different languages.

Uh, so lots of things that make trade difficult.

So we know it's an avenue for growth.

You know, trade unlocked Scythian growth, medieval people, you know,

even before Smith would have been aware of the positive

benefits the train brings.

But actually conducting it, especially in any scale, is very,

very difficult.

Um, so some solution, uh, merchant guilds.

We won't talk about these in detail, but an example

would be the Hanseatic League.

Uh, anybody heard of the Hanseatic League?

Can you tell me what it is?

It's a league of merchants in, like, Germany and the

Netherlands.

Yeah.

Baltic as well.

Right.

Uh, great maritime area.

So it's a similar institution to the craft guilds we

talked about.

But, you know, a union of maritime traders in northwestern

Europe, um, who basically forged, uh, and, uh, reinforced trade

barriers in that part of the world.

Right.

Um, formal marketing fairs.

So when I say market, right?

What do you think?

When I talk about a market.

What comes into your mind?

Yeah.

Clearly defined.

Property rights.

Okay, so you think about clearly defined property rights and

the enforcement of those being important.

What else?

Anybody else?

Anybody else have some ideas?

So I think that is market in like the theoretical

sense when you talk often when you talk about markets

in the medieval period, we're talking about physical things.

Right.

This is much bigger in Europe, uh, than it is

here.

But like the a weekly, weekly town market, you know,

we have farmer's markets that occur, I guess, like in,

in London, they tend to be like quite bougie things.

But, um, one of the things that helps trade grow

is the emergence of Local nexus of exchange in the

term in the form of weekly markets like in the

11th and 12th century.

These explode, we take for granted now that we're able

to buy what we want, when we want, and we've

actually shifted away from local markets to the internet mostly.

But, um, these things like the pop up, uh, markets

in towns and villages happening weekly for kind of staple

items, you also get things called fairs, right?

You might read about, uh, in the class champagne fairs

in that part of the continent.

These are kind of once or twice a year wholesale

events for high value items.

Right?

And as I talked about before, these informal reputational mechanisms.

Right.

Maybe you have a certain religious group, maybe you have

the Hanseatic League or whatever, but other avenues to solve

this fundamental problem of exchange.

Okay.

So, um.

One thing we need to remember will be a handful

of debunk today.

Uh, but long distance trade existed long before the modern

era.

Right.

That's a stylised fact.

It's absolutely true.

The Romans have a sophisticated trading network, definitely integrates most

places in the Mediterranean, but extends beyond that as well.

Right.

First, it's centred around the port of Ostia.

If anybody been to Ostia, Ostia Antica, it's fantastic.

Just a short train ride from Rome.

Uh, I highly recommend it.

Um, after that, it up moves to Portus.

Uh, but the Romans had a sophisticated trading network.

So did the medieval world.

Right?

Even after Rome fell.

Uh, we know from God's work that, uh, a lot

of the Roman trade network stayed Intact, at least in

the western half of the Empire after 500.

So if you believe a hooligan is every reason to

do so, she will tell you that by the 13th

century, much of the known world was connected by trade.

As she talked, I think there's nine circuits one, two,

three, four, five, six, eight circuits one, two, three, four,

five, six, eight circuits.

Um, right.

So the world is integrated in a 13th century.

So you might say, if you believe this, that visualisation

is a 13th century phenomenon.

Um, if you want, you can go back and watch

this video.

Uh, so there's extensive trade networks across Eurasia, but some

important questions remain, right.

Because a link is one thing.

The volume of trade going on between the two poles

of that link is a fully other question, right?

Um, we also want to understand how social, political, technological

developments might have shaped trade and what kind of status

quo or equilibrium we might have gotten to.

Um, when you go back to the hulls.

One of the other stylised facts about medieval and early

modern trade, uh, is that there's many notes on the

link.

So if you want to trade something right from China

and you want it to get to Western Europe, you're

going to have to go through many middlemen, right?

Um, crossing borders, encountering all those bottlenecks, the trade that

we've just highlighted.

Uh, and the goods are essentially, you know, resold each

time.

What's that going to do to the end consumer?

Um, overall high costs because high transaction costs.

Yeah.

So it raises the end.

Uh, price for the consumer restricts commodities.

We should not lose sight of the fact that there's

lots of people deriving livelihood from reselling these goods all

the time, but it raises transaction costs.

Exactly.

Okay, so.

Uh.

We have the Roman trading world.

Some of that might have existed even after the fall

of the western half of the Roman Empire.

Right.

There was also a number of things that happened in

medieval Europe that, you know, perhaps slightly counterintuitive, but, uh,

created market integration even accidentally.

Uh, one thing I want to talk about is the

Christian crusades, right?

That has market integrating effects.

The expansion of the Mongol Empire has, uh, integrating effects.

Uh, and then I want to talk about, you know,

the great poles of commerce and how they shift from

the Mediterranean.

Remember, I've been talking this whole time about the economic

epicentre moving from the Mediterranean to the North Atlantic area.

Well, this happens obviously, unsurprisingly, in trade as well.

Um, and it's no surprise then, that you know, the

best some of the most established, uh, urban, you know,

economies start off in Italy and end up in the

Low Countries.

Uh, we can talk a bit about the Hanseatic linking

at the end.

Um, so the Crusades, right?

Who knows?

Something about the Crusades?

What?

What are what are these?

Uh, it's a big episode.

Famous episode in medieval history.

What are the Crusades?

Can anybody tell me?

Anybody heard about crusades before?

Yes.

So was it.

Basically a bunch of Christian Catholics went over to the

Middle East to try and claim back Holy Land, and

it was all sort of the Pope was calling Christians

from all over.

Yeah, it's a series of military endeavours.

Uh, you know, starting in, you know, Western Europe, basically,

uh, catalysed by the church to try to go and

retake the Holy Land from this rule.

Um, it's kind of tends to get bundled into six

different discrete crusades.

So people talk about the First Crusade, the Second Crusade.

Um, but there's some form of, you know, permanent European

presence in the Middle East throughout this period, and that's

going to be important for trade.

Uh, and the issue is very simple and straightforward.

Both Christian and Muslim armies that are fighting each other.

They need to be supplied.

Um, these down here, if anybody wants to take some.

Let's keep the candy flowing.

Uh, so what this does is because there's a move.

It's a bit like London, right?

North.

South seems to have better established trade regimes.

East west?

It's more difficult.

Um, but the fact that these crusades are happening, whatever

reason, you know, the or the motivation for doing that

reinforces east west trade links.

Um, and actually, despite the fact that they're definitely, uh,

at war with each other, there's actually quite a bit

of trade between Muslims and Christians over this long period

of crusades.

And actually trade ends up being a decisive factor in

a lot, uh, of the outcomes of war.

So the war reinforces trade.

Trade reinforces the war.

Right.

So we all we're going to have to think about

this again when we get back, when we do our

discrete lecture on war, uh, and following class, um, war,

you know, is a horrible thing, uh, for the people

who experience it.

Uh, and, you know, lots of innocent people get caught

up in it.

Um, but, uh, we acknowledge that.

Uh, we also acknowledge that, uh, it has externalities.

Right.

One of them is, you know, uh, creating trade, creating

and reinforcing trade links that not only end up being

decisive in the outcome of the war.

101 you might talk about the economic factors that shape

the outcome of world wars, but also the wars themselves

might reinforce trade in the Middle Ages.

So an example, um, is the Siege of Achor that

happens in 1189 1191.

I think acre is probably somewhere in North Israel now.

It's a really, really compelling story.

Um, so what happens is the Christian crusaders are on

their way to try to conquer Jerusalem, right?

As these medieval aristocratic knights tend to do, uh, one

of them gets this great idea on the way to

Jerusalem that says, hey, let's just stop, uh, and capture

this Muslim fortification while we're here.

Right?

It's like a pit stop for them, is what they're

thinking.

Uh, and basically, uh, Muslim army, very well fortified in

this castle and acre on the coast.

Right.

Um, so the Christians come in and say, hey, we're

going to take this place.

Uh, and they surround the castle, but then, uh, they

very, very quickly are surrounded themselves, uh, by the, uh,

Muslim army of Saladin.

So now there's a bit of a stalemate.

All right, so the, uh, Muslim army is here.

The Christian army is here.

Uh, and they're surrounded in turn by Saladin's army.

Right?

Uh, and the garrison can only be supplied, uh, by

sea via the harbour.

Um, and what happens is that the naval control of

the harbour changes hands, uh, a number of times over

this two year period.

Uh, and at some point when the crusading army has

control of the harbour, the Muslim garrison, you know, runs

out of food.

And this gives you some really, really interesting insight into

the minds of medieval aristocrats.

We spend a lot of time trying to say, hey,

actually, perhaps the medieval world is not so different from

ours in some respects.

Are you dealing with rational decision makers, people who wanted

to improve their position there definitely know about trade and

the advances that brings anyway.

This is some food for thought.

Basically, when the Christians have control of the harbour, the

Muslim garrison, and the thing runs out of food and

they say, guys.

We're out of food.

Just let us go, right?

Don't kill us.

You can have the castle.

We give up.

Uh, and the Christians here twice, they say no, uh,

we're going to take this thing in a blaze of

glory, or we aren't going to take it at all.

Uh, then the Muslim, uh, Navy takes control of the

harbour.

All of a sudden, um, it's the garrison that can

be supplied and the crusading Christian army cannot.

Winter comes and most of them starving freeze to death.

Right.

So it's actually quite interesting, this whole idea of chivalry,

not very rational in a lot of ways.

Um, well, what happens is, is the terms of trade

is a range of externalities, right?

So, uh, we talked about technology being a very broad

church.

Not only is it things like a heavy plough, but

it's also ideas.

Uh, one of the things that gets traded in, in

the knowledge economy as a direct result of facades is

the, uh, Arabic numerals.

Pardon me.

Right.

So this is something I do on a daily basis,

but for, uh, this comes back from the Muslim world.

We're dealing with this stuff, right?

Uh, and it's not very easy.

This is six, uh, plus four, so we get ten,

but this is much easier, right?

Uh, so you get Arabic numerals, much more efficient for

arithmetic.

Maybe that in turn makes trading or accounting more, more,

uh, important?

Um, but there's also a whole range of goods that

come back to Europe from the Middle East as a

direct result.

Right.

I might talk about warhorses.

Right.

You hear that?

You read these letters of these knights that are off,

uh, in the Middle East, and they're writing back home

and they're like, you should see the horses they have

here.

They make our pinnacles look ridiculous.

Um, prices are another big one.

Right.

So we talked about this industrial revolution that happens in

the later period.

Uh, and the whole idea there was that there's a

portfolio of new goods.

All of a sudden, people have more things that they

can buy, more things that they want, and they're willing

to work harder in order to get them.

Well, it's not the first time that happened, because back

from the Middle East comes a range of new goods,

and there's a whole lot of demand for it.

What might be different, I suppose, is whether the demand

for goods that come out of, you know, trade created

by the crusading armies was mostly consumed by elites.

Perhaps that's why there's no medieval industrial revolution.

Anyway, here's an example of a warhorse, right?

Almost certainly acquired by Sir Geoffrey Luttrell, uh, originally from

the Middle East, because you could see his feet aren't

dragging on the ground.

Um, but you get a lot of these.

So here's what's really interesting.

Bear with me, because I'm going to take a little

bit of a culinary, uh, diversion here, right?

Because here are a range of spices you encounter in

the medieval world.

A lot of them are, uh, familiar to us now.

Um, but here, let's look at, uh, a late 14th

century, uh, recipe, uh, can be found both in England

and in France.

Uh.

I don't even know how one would pronounce this.

Pollo.

Anybody speak French?

Now, what we say here, Palmo.

Come on.

Anyway, uh, some kind of meat, protein, eggs, parsley, rice

flour.

But ginger, mace, cardamom, cloves.

Right.

Uh, currants and almonds.

This probably could be got from the Mediterranean.

But anyway, uh, here is a whole portfolio of spices.

So, you know, we don't have a whole lot of

direct evidence of trade.

So historians have kind of peer around corners, but as

evidence that things like exotic spices that existed only in

the medieval, medieval Middle East were being consumed in Western

Europe, you can find that, you know, centuries later, but

in recipes.

Right?

Uh, this one a roast cap on, which is some

kind of bird with black sauce.

Does anybody feel like maybe we should have a cooking

class?

Uh, I don't know if anybody wants to, um, boil

a chicken, um, next term, but we could try.

I'm a vegetarian myself, but, uh, anyway, interesting thing.

I could go on and on and on.

Uh, this is a fish dish.

Uh, this is a wild boar.

Is anybody eating wild boar?

No, no, I mean, me.

Um, this is roast lamb.

But the interesting thing I find is that if you

compare this with modern South Asian recipes, you see the

same kind of spice portfolio, right?

There's a lot of medieval, uh, European dishes that are

using the same spices as those that are used in

modern Indian cooking, right?

Evidence of trade.

Um, it's making me very hungry now.

Uh, and some of these spices.

Right.

Uh, we're very expensive.

Others are more attainable.

So if you look at how much this is kind

of like an elite labourer or a master mason.

So this is somebody in that guild framework who had

been through an apprenticeship, become an apprentice or become a

journeyman, now had their own workshop.

Uh, right.

So their, their High earning, um, labourer.

But, you know, you could they could buy you more

pepper than they could buy saffron.

Uh, which has anybody tried to buy saffron recently?

It's still expensive.

Okay.

Um, some things never change.

So that's the Crusades, right?

Uh, Mongol Empire.

Um.

Interestingly.

Right.

Same thing.

Uh, perhaps more on the Asian side of Eurasia.

But the expansion of the Mongol Empire creates further, uh,

East-West integrations.

Right?

Um, what happens, uh, is that when the Mongols expand

in the 13th century, they create what the Christians call

a lot in the Pax Mongolia.

Uh, anybody want to translate that for me?

For what?

Do I do what it means?

Yeah.

Uh.

Mongolian peace.

Mongolian peace.

Right.

Um, so the idea is that the Asian institutions, uh,

before the Mongolian expansion, tended to be very sceptical of

merchant activity in that merchants were kind of regarded broadly

as rent seekers.

Uh, the Mongols.

Right.

They start to expand.

We have a little bit of time so we can

watch this one at work.

Do I want to continue?

Yes I do.

I could do without the wardrobe.

But anyway.

Yeah, I wonder how.

Anyway, you.

Get the idea.

Um.

Here's this in static form.

Uh, you know, over the course of the 13th century,

you have this massive expansion of the nomadic Mongol people,

right?

Uh, most genetically, uh, horses we have in the modern

era have come from this area.

They're, uh, nomadic horse riding people.

Um, but so a it makes travel east to west

more possible because the Mongols require provisions.

Right.

There are nomadic people.

They can't do sedentary agriculture to set up.

Right.

The whole thing is kind of blitz warfare.

Um, so the recognise that they need to create an

environment that's conducive to trade because that is essential for

how they conduct this very effective style of warfare.

Right.

So what they do in this Mongolian piece is they

legislate an environment that facilitates trade.

So merchants get military protection, they get tax exemptions.

Right?

Because there are nomadic people who have a need to

bring the kind of ideology that, you know, uh, exists

before this period tended to look negatively in merchants.

The Mongols trade that, right.

So this is at the same period simultaneously.

You have the Christian crusades, uh, a century of Mongol

expansion.

Um, and the result is increased overland trade.

Right.

Silk route, all of that kind of stuff.

Uh, in Europe.

These are just simply, like two idiots, uh, to, you

know, think though basically about how the process of market

integration and therefore, you know, creating the rewards that Smithy

and growth is supposed to create, how they unfold in

the historical narrative.

Right.

Um, we also get this shifting of the commercial urban

poles from Italian city states to, you know, the North

Atlantic area and the Hanseatic League.

Right.

So the Italians dominate, uh, commerce in the High Middle

Ages, right?

Um, so pop pussy has a role here?

Uh, a kind of tax collector and bankers.

There's a urban legacy that exists from the, uh, western

half of the Roman Empire.

Um, and, you know, urban centres similar to the Mongols.

And, you know, the Mongols are nomads, so they need

a trade to survive urban centres.

You know, by the very definition, require trade to survive

because they aren't farmers, they're, you know, craftsmen or, you

know, there's not a whole lot of farmland.

Um, so this positions in the early and high Middle

Ages.

Uh, these Italian city states to very, uh, conveniently, uh,

serve urban commerce.

Right?

Why?

Because they inherited a lot of urban centres already.

Uh, from the Romans.

Um, they have, uh, the Pope and that layer of

kind of administrative, uh, provisions of capital that works quite

well.

There's something else.

Right.

Thinking about the geography of trade that I've just described.

Right.

And the location of Italy.

Why else are Italian city states well-served for commerce?

Well-positioned for commerce?

Anybody have any ideas?

Yeah.

Access to Mediterranean on the east and west.

And then access to, like, continental Europe.

Very well positioned to be a hub of exchange from

the Middle East to Western Europe, right.

So that's a factor as well.

Uh, the R is this intermediate link between Europe and

Asia.

So you get Asian spices and other luxury goods going

there.

Um, they have historic ties with the Byzantine Empire, right.

The Byzantine Empire, this is the eastern half of the

Roman Empire that never really collapsed.

Um, but also the Islamic world.

Uh, and they have these innovations in banking and financial

institutions, right?

It's not just the Pope.

It's also these famous Italian banking families like the Bardi

and the Medici, uh, etc., etc. they create one of

these.

You know, we'll talk about this in the money lecture

later.

Uh, these Italian urban, um, merchants and bankers create this

bill of exchange, right?

It's essentially a financial instrument that allows you to exchange

money without cash in multiple currencies.

Right.

One of the main barriers to trade in this period

is that money is coin, if it exists at all.

It's coin.

So if I need to pay you, uh, £50, I

need to bring you, like, £50 of silver pennies.

It's not very difficult.

And while I'm, like, waddling over here with £50, I

can easily be attacked.

And you could take my £50.

So for large scale long distance transactions, the financial instruments

of the bill of exchange is very important.

More on that next time.

But then, uh, as this gravity moves northwest, why does

it move northwest?

Well, we've talked about all of this right at the

same time.

Um, the agriculture of and the, uh, northwest of Europe

is being harnessed with the heavy plough and extensive use

of animals.

So all of a sudden, you're getting the roots of

very prosperous, uh, medieval societies.

Uh, they start to have a demand for trade.

um, and the commercial centre moves with the economic gravity

to the northwest.

Uh, and you end up the late medieval, early modern

period with kind of the, I think, the peak example

of how far the commercial and economic gravity had changed.

So you have this very, very extensive network, uh, that

look, you know, England, the Baltic, the Low Countries and

Scandinavia and into Kievan Rus, like, all very, very well

integrated.

Um, so, uh, the I mean, to provide kind of

the historical framing here, the Dutch have a victory over

the league in the 15th century, which I think kind

of cements the takeover from, uh, the commercial supremacy arising

firmly in the Dutch before, In, you know, modern day

Netherlands before the Dutch Golden Age, you have Dutch towns

becoming increasingly economically active.

Uh, they don't have the same degree of feudalism and

realism, uh, or serfdom that exists in other places in

Europe.

Uh, high degree of ownership of peasants owning lands.

You also have reclamation of land from the sea, literally.

And the polder mentality.

Right.

Um, livestock again.

You know, I am biased here because I study horses,

but I keep talking about how the importance of livestock

are, uh, livestock are important in, uh, the degree are

is allowing, uh, the Dutch to rise, uh, economically.

And, and this kind of work symbiotically with the establishment

of their urban trading centres.

Right.

Um, return once more, probably for the last time, to

the highly advanced agriculture, but that, you know, allows the

organisation to increase significantly in the North Sea area.

And they become very, very dependent on trade, right, to

increase, to feed increasingly urban populations.

Right.

And then this has commercial spill-overs again, because I talked

about the rise of nexus of exchange.

Right now you get, uh, highly productive agriculture, uh, relatively

free societies.

Um, and uh, the physical locations, uh, protected by kind

of merchant law to exchange high quality, uh, expensive items

in, uh, large quantities.

Right.

And all of that, you know, starts to work in

a virtuous cycle to establish the North Sea area as

the pole of commerce in the late medieval period.

Right.

Um, there's more on this if you want to look

into it for an essay.

Uh, the final stage, I think, in this discussion has

to involve, um, European seafaring in the 16th century.

So, um, I owe you a lecture on, uh, coerced

labour and the slave trade.

Uh, because I missed it last week when I was

sick.

So the way I've done this now is we'll talk

about European seafaring, its implications for trade, and then tomorrow

I'm going to record myself giving last week's lecture.

Uh, you've already had your class on it, and I'll

put it up on the Moodle, and then we'll get

to the same place by the end of term, just

with a slightly different route.

But anyway, what happens in the 16th century is that

the Portuguese in particular start to become very, very good

at building boats.

Uh, this is the development of a whole suite of

nautical navigation instruments that make, uh, navigation easier.

And there's the first time all of the globe zones

are connected.

Right.

So, Janet Hula, God was talking about most of the

known world.

But, you know, the Americas are kind of still isolated

from Europe and Eurasia more broadly.

Um, and what this does when Europeans discover, uh, the

New World, um, is that they create this thing called

the Colombian exchange.

Does anybody familiar with this term, the Colombian exchange, or

do you think the term comes from the Colombian aspect

of it in particular?

Any ideas?

Um, is it drugs?

No, no, I mean, that's a that's a fair choice.

It's a it's a good guess.

Uh, plus, what else?

Is your.

Agricultural products after Columbus discovers the new world.

Right?

So here's what happens.

Uh, Prince Henry the Navigator.

Right.

This famous Portuguese guy, uh, he creates, uh, first to

utilise a whole suite of new oceangoing, advanced vessels.

They're still not nearly as advanced as the Chinese, uh,

junks, but that's another story for another day.

Um, this is a good point.

To debunk yet another medieval myth, right?

People will say, oh, in the Middle Ages, people thought

the art world was flat.

Absolutely not true.

Here is a 15th century globe, right?

Uh oh.

That's over the top.

Anyway, the guy who built this globe slightly overestimated the

eastward extent of Asia, but we'll forgive him for that.

Nobody in the Middle Ages thought the world was flat.

That's just a myth created by early modern Europeans to

make themselves feel better about whatever they have or have

not accomplished by the time.

Anyway.

So Portugal was.

The first European nation to start going further and further

by sea.

Why do they do this?

Well, they have, uh, you know, a desire for things

like these spices we talked about.

They also have a desire for gold.

The overland routes that had started to be, uh, created

and reinforced in the 12th and 13th centuries.

They're long, they're expensive.

There's lots of intermediaries.

If you could go there directly by boat, you can

cut a lot of, uh, intermediaries out.

Right?

There's also political and religious motivations.

The Christian population have this myth.

They believe, uh, there's an isolated Christian community Somewhere in

Africa led by this guy called Prester John.

And they're trying to find this enclave of Christians in

Muslim North Africa.

So and because it's done, you know, yet another episode

to carry out war against Muslims.

Um, but externality here is they go from Portugal around

South Africa and the Cape of Good Hope.

Uh, and they can trade directly with South Asia by

this route.

So this is, uh, de Gama's first, you know, long

distance trade route to India at the end of the

15th century.

Does anybody know why the route back is so squiggly

here?

Any ideas?

Anybody sail?

It's this tacking thing to, you know, if you want

to sail into the wind, uh, into the prevailing wind,

you have to go back and forth.

That's why it does that.

Um, anyway, this is made possible by, as I said,

a revolution, a ship thing.

I mean, it's a revolution to the Europeans.

It is, uh, they still look like bathtubs compared to

Chinese junks.

Um, aided by new navigation instruments like this.

The quadrant.

Right.

Uh, new ship designs.

They look something like this.

You've probably, you know, seen something that looks vaguely familiar,

or this should look vaguely familiar to you.

Um.

But, uh, then this spreads quickly to other European nations,

and they kind of, you know, discover other places where

they quickly start to establish colonies.

So, uh, it increases maritime trade, right?

Um, and the consequences are Europeans looking for spices and

gold, right.

The other things that become famous, especially in the kind

of regime that coerced labour that I have in a

lecture waiting for you in London.

Um.

Like cotton, like coffee, like tea.

Which ultimately, significantly more important economically.

Uh, well, definitely more important than spices.

Maybe as important as gold right there.

Discovered only, um, as a in the by-product.

Or accidentally.

Right as, uh, Europeans travel around the globe.

Um.

Ultimately, we end up in this situation, right?

Uh, this huge, uh, revolution in trading, uh, because new

things, previously foreign things are introduced both ways.

Right?

So horses, for example, I talk about them all the

time.

They had previously existed in the Americas that had gone

extinct.

They're reintroduced for the first time.

Right.

There's this myth that all the horses in America can

be traced back to a handful of animals that, like,

escaped from Spanish colonisers.

And there's probably some element of truth to that.

Um, but a lot of things were like avocados arriving

in Europe.

Uh, potatoes.

Right.

Which European populations go on to famously rely on, uh,

sweetcorn tomatoes?

Um, tobacco is another big one, right?

Uh, this is a big part of the kind of

consumption revolution and industrial revolution.

More things for people to spend their money on.

Anybody know what quinine is?

Get some nods over here.

No.

Does anybody ever had a gin and tonic?

That's what makes tonic water bitter, right?

Uh, and.

Yes.

But the thing here also is that diseases go back

the other way.

Right.

So one of the reasons that the Europeans were so

successful in colonising the Americas is that they actually didn't

have to fight indigenous populations, uh, particularly viciously, because that's

proportion of them died when European diseases that, uh, Aboriginal

or indigenous populations had no immunity to were introduced a

lot of time.

Uh, that is the lecture on trade.

Uh, thank you very much for an excellent term.

Um, look out for the lecture online.

Uh, you have no essays until the middle of winter

term, so enjoy your break.

Thank you very much.

Well, you know.

I.

Hope Is.

Are you going to get it now?

Oh.

Thank you.

Oh you're living.

When I go back, when I get bored.

Oh I do I go.

Oh I.

See you around.

Yes.

Yes.

This is the thing.

I would say it's up to you.

Yeah, right.

Are you hitting back?

Do you like it?

You know, it's crazy when you fly.

I mean, I got a little break with you.

Oh, my.

My friends back home.

So.

Just Um.

All right.

If you come in the early evening.

Oh, I actually do, because I know you.

It's going to be a shame.

Oh, wait.

Why are you.

Leaving?

Why did you.

Come?

Honestly?

I was.

Because you were cold.

It's freezing by my hand as I was leaving.

Oh.

Don't drop it.

I was watching the power cuts.

I'm worried that we're gonna have to find a trash

can.

Oh.

Thank you, thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you.

Oh.

And we're going.

Anything less than that one.

Thank you.

Yes.

It's just.

So.

Thank you.

Thank you very much.

Um.

Right.

So he was trying to.

Lecture 11:

And All right, well, I gave it away there.

Does anybody know that song?

OK.

Money by Pink Floyd.

OK, what is the most defining characteristic of this song?

OK, so yeah, the lyrical content dovetails nicely musically though,

yes, which is.

So Yeah, it's 74, right?

If anybody before the end of this term can name

me another rock and roll song in 74, um, I

mean, I can't award you any grades, but I mean

there will be an award.

So, uh, yeah, anyway, so two interesting things about the

song of the week this week, um.

I am going to start with the administrative stuff, uh,

before we get into the interesting thing.

So, uh, form of essay, I've released the questions.

It's due at the end of week 5.

this is 2000 words, right?

So longer than the ones you've written before, but this

is kind of like your last trial run, um, to

get yourself into fighting shape, uh, before things count for

real money.

Um, 5 questions.

If you're really interested in the mercantilism question, um, you're

probably gonna want to read ahead a bit because, uh,

that lecture I think is in week 3 of this

term.

So, uh, anyway.

Questions about the essay?

OK, um.

Other bits of business, uh, you're all here, so that's

fantastic, um, but, uh, we are going to revert back

to our normal, uh, policy of saving the lecture recordings

until the end of this term, um, so please do

come to the lectures whenever possible.

Uh, all right.

Have I missed anything?

No, Greg doesn't think so.

So he's usually right on these things.

OK, so today, um, we want to talk about money

and finance.

As you can remember back before the Christmas break, right,

we had gone through, uh, a lot of channels, causal

channels that might explain the development of pre-industrial economies, right?

We talked about population and resources, uh, we talked about,

um, expropriation by elites in that Marxist paradigm.

Uh, we talked about technology, uh.

So you might think that we've waited this long, you

know, to actually talk about money, right?

Um, so I think what we're here to do today

is understand the role uh of money broadly construed in

the pre-industrial world and then think a bit about how

money um might have influenced the development of economies, right?

Uh.

I mean, can anybody think why monetary explanations might have

a role in the development of mediaeval and early modern

times?

Why might money be important?

Any ideas?

This is a bit of a beer.

Have any, feel free to speculate wildly.

Why might money be important?

I mean, I think you probably take it for granted

in EH101.

Yeah.

Yeah, it facilitates exchange.

We're gonna get into that.

What else?

What else does money do?

Or you might want to think of the, yeah.

It influences prices, right?

So you think about, you know, supply and demand influences

prices, and they obviously do, but the availability or unavailability

of money, um, is also an important factor, right, especially

think about the massive population swings you have over the

course of the pre-industrial period, right?

So David Hurley, he has a saying about the black

saying about the black death, you know that.

Men were dying, but coins were not.

What does that mean?

That basically means that the per capita money supply, the

amount of money in, you know, mediaeval Europe per person

who survived the plague had just gone up, right?

All of a sudden there was more money per capita.

What does that do to prices?

What does that do to economic decision making?

Um, anything else about money.

Presence or absence of.

OK, we'll get some more back, right?

So why is money important?

That's where we'll start.

Uh, how did mediaeval money work?

Um, I mean this is a field unto itself, right?

Many of my esteemed colleagues, uh, and one of them

here at LSE, my, my colleague Oliver work exclusively in

this field, right?

People donate donate.

Devote, uh, careers to this I give a very, very

broad overview, um, thinking about what, what and then finally

how did money work, what forms did it take in

the pre-industrial period, right?

So the stylized facts are, um, that basically markets and

the money monetization of economies expand broadly over our period,

right, especially.

From the kind of classic high Middle Ages chronology, which

some people refer to as the so-called commercial revolution, right?

So, economies get more monetized and they also get more

commercialised.

Um.

Money has a range of functions that we're going to

talk about, uh, and then we might think, you know,

at the end of today, and maybe if you choose

to think about this in an essay, you want to

evaluate the monetary factors against the other ones that we've

discussed, um.

OK, so, uh, Financial systems support economic growth in the

past, as in the present through two channels primarily, right?

As you said, they make exchange easier, right, but also

by facilitating credit relationships, right?

that moves capital around.

Monetary systems allow uh accumulated capital or savings to be

transferred from investors to borrowers.

Borrowers, the presumption will be can use that money more

effectively, more productively, uh, than the investors can.

So stores of value allow capital to be used effectively

in the economy, right?

And that's really something that money, uh, a channel through

which money works in the, in the pre-industrial period.

Um, yeah, so, There's this concept called the coincidence of

wants, right?

And this concept uh is crucial to understanding at a

highly stylized, highly abstract uh level um about why money

is important, because what do you have in the absence

of money?

How do you Accomplish exchange in the absence of.

You have to partner, right?

So, uh, if you have an unmonetized economy, entirely unmonetized

economy, you two individuals have to exchange goods for the

things they want, right?

If you ever play Catan or, um.

Understand this concept very well.

that was a reference that I made.

Um But if you have something and you want something

else, you have to find somebody else who at a

single place and at the same time wants.

To take what you have, and they also have to

have something that you want in return, right?

So, Later is actually a very, very inefficient process, right?

If I produce sheep and I want wheat, I have

to find somebody who wants wheat and produces sheep, right?

So, um, This actually is illustrated very, very well in

mediaeval sources, right?

This comes from the famous, uh, Eric Eric, right?

And there's a conversation between two monks.

Monk A says, I'd like to buy your book that

you've, you know, written in your scriptorum.

Uh, Monk B says, OK, great, I want 2 pounds

of pure silver.

I want money, right?

How do you plan to pay me?

Monkey says, well, I could pay you in sheep, I

could pay you in goats, I could pay you with

my cow, I could pay you in beans, uh, hay,

or 16 other things, but none of them are coined.

Um, and the monk A kind of, you know, Monk

B says the same thing.

Actually, you know, I still want money, uh, because he

who has silver can get anything he wants.

And ultimately, they exchanged 12 silver coins.

So, uh, Monk A did have some money and was

able to find it eventually, right?

But this is The coincidence of wants, uh, or the

requirements to coordinate complicated barter exchanges, money kind of disposes

of the need to do that.

And the idea is there's more utility.

Uh, with money as a store of value than anything

else that could be bartered and non-monetary exchanges, right, what

we would typically call them like an in-kind economy, right?

And this is something I work on quite a bit.

It's paying things income, paying your rent in grain, receiving

your wage in clothing and accommodation, right?

That's the in-kind economy, whereas money is being paid in

currency, and that currency in the mediaeval world is typically

coins of precious metals, right?

And I mean even now we live in a highly,

highly monetized economy, but the in-kind economy still exists, right?

Can anybody think of an in-kind payment.

That still persists uh in modern wages today.

Yeah.

Benefits, yeah, that could be, could be something.

What if I'm thinking of a specific kind of Healthcare,

yeah, baby, what, what about like a company car, right?

Company car is something that like I, I imagine somebody

in this room is going to graduate, get a job

and that job is going to come with a company

car.

That's an in-kind payment, right?

Because, and you might, you know, ultimately say my salary

is lower than it would otherwise be if they didn't

give me this car, but that's in kind payment.

It even gets more abstract, right?

You could argue that LSE is providing me with some

kind of in-kind payment by allowing me to teach you

in this room because I'm sheltered from the rain right

now, right?

Um, anyway, so my point is monetization is important, but

let's not forget about the persistence of the importance of

the in-kind economy, right?

So how does this work?

Back to my Catan examples, right?

You have, uh, person A has sheep wants wheat, person

B has wheat, but wants timber.

OK, well, that doesn't work.

Uh, right, that doesn't work, um, but if you introduce

money into this equation, it solves the problem because it

provides a medium of exchange that everybody is willing to

accept, right?

You don't have to find a partner that lines up

with what you want and what they want.

It works as a store of value, and that's important

because, you know, maybe eventually I will, uh.

You know, this guy will want sheep, which is not

on the day that I'm at the market with my

sheep, um.

So, uh, you can't store value very easily without money,

right?

Most goods are perishable, uh, if you grow grain, it's

very difficult to store, uh, rats eat it, it rots,

right?

Money is a store of value is very, very important

as well, right?

And also, it's a unit of account.

How do you figure out exactly, you know, how much

timber you might exchange for a sheep, right?

There's no Living in the 8th century, there's no like

conversion table published about, well, a good sheep is worth

so much wood, right?

Um, but once you have cash, then the information, right,

the markets provide the information about how much commodities are

worth through the aggregation of various transactions, right?

So all of a sudden you can account for things.

So that's, you know, 3 ways that money is important,

right?

And if you actually start to pause a moment and

think about because we, we live in such a highly

monetized society, we think about this, we take units of

account for granted, right?

Ever since any of us in this room have been

born, right, we understood things in prices and that's how

we understand value, um.

We take that for granted, but that only comes with

the monetization of an economy, right?

We also take the ability to store things, you know,

in, in cash or otherwise for granted, and that wasn't

always the case.

So, in this barter system, how do you make this

work, right?

Well, um, you have to, uh, Solve it in a

number of ways.

If you have money, it fixes it, right?

Uh, money makes that trade possible.

Uh, money makes this other trade possible, right?

And then all of a sudden money circulates between three

traders and they don't have to instantaneously be at the

same place with a corresponding set of matching, um, desires,

right?

These transactions can happen whenever you want, wherever you want,

uh, so.

You can see how it um makes transactions much more

practical and efficient.

Any questions?

Getting a bit of a headache in this room, but,

uh, going back and forth.

Anyway, um, so how does money actually look, right?

Well, precious metals, primarily are how pre-industrial economies, uh, what

they use for their currency, right?

Um, they work well, uh, because they don't have a

high, um, because they do have a high value to

weight ratio.

They aren't perishable and they're easily recognisable, right?

Um.

So originally money would have probably just been chunks of

of precious metal or even of ore, but relatively simultaneously

across the ancient world, uh, we see the development and

efflorescence of minted coins like this, right?

um.

And, uh, coins are preferable to commodity money or income

exchange, uh, because the coinages are often issued by some

kind of authority, right?

So we haven't talked about states yet.

Um, but we now associate money and currency with states

almost exclusively, except for Bitcoin.

Right, anybody in here own Bitcoin, right?

Like I'm.

I never figure out if it's entirely a scam or

if I'm just like missing the greatest investment opportunity of

my life, um, but, uh, anyway, Bitcoin would be, you

know, since the invention of money may be one of

the first things that, uh, isn't directly associated with the

state, which I gather is partly the appeal, um.

Anyway, these authorities guarantee that weight and fineness, fineness if

you encounter in the literature, simply means the proportion of

precious metal in a coin.

Higher fineness typically means more silver, more gold in the

coin relative to its mass, right?

This is because these poems are actually alloy combined with

uh.

Non-precious metals, uh, from malleability.

Anyway, the authorities guarantee the fineness of the coin, uh,

decide what it looks like to make it recognisable, um.

And all of that makes at least in theory, easier

to use because, you know, if you just had chunks

of silver, chunks of gold, you would at minimum have

had to weigh it, right?

Uh, and say, OK, well you've brought me 7 ounces

of silver and that's enough to buy this much wheat,

you know, you need to, you know, you're dealing with

small uh amounts of mass which are hard to measure

accurately in the mediaeval period, um.

But also, you know, you don't know what the purity

of some lump of silver silver or some guy is

dragged out of his pocket, right?

Uh, but theoretically anyway, the Central authority and it doesn't

have to be a state we're we're living here in

a pre-state era, but one of these local lords will

produce currency and it's quite literally, you know, his seal

of approval saying I have produced this.

I vouch for the amount of precious metal it contains

and therefore its value, uh, etc.

etc.

OK.

Um, does anybody know why the coin has this?

Little ring Anybody have a coin in their pocket?

This used to work back, back, you know, not too

long ago.

Uh, anybody can find a coin in their pocket, let

me know, uh, because I bet you it has something

similar to that series of ridges around the outside.

Um, OK, so money is a medium of exchange.

Uh, if anybody finds a coin, oh, I hear a

coin.

OK, let's see.

Uh.

So yeah, it has the.

Yeah This is a 10 depends piece and it has

these little ridges around the end.

This is.

I, yeah.

in Canada's the size of what we call a dime.

I But it also has the Very much.

Uh, OK, what can you buy with 15%?

Um, all right.

So, uh, we'll come back to this.

We'll come back to the ridges, uh, on mediaeval coins

and modern coins, right?

So, money is a medium of exchange, right?

Uh, the gold and silver coins, sometimes copper, uh, right,

they become the money of account, they're a store of

value, and also as a standard of deferred payment, right?

So basically, the invention of money.

Really, really lubricates the years of credit, right, because it's

easier to loan money and repay money in coin than

it is to try to loan value in other ways

that you might store store value, right, like, you know,

in an agrarian economy sheep or wood or uh wool

or something like that, right?

So in mediaeval and early modern Europe, right, we're dealing

with silver coins sometimes supplemented by gold coins.

Uh, so this actually starts in the 8th century with

Charlemagne, so many things do, creates a system, um, a

counting mechanism of pounds, shillings, and pence.

Um, And if any of you aspire to become mediaeval

historians, like this is something you'll have to grapple with

for the rest of your natural lives, uh, as, um.

Greg and I do, uh, on a daily basis, right,

because it's not a decimalized system.

Right, you take 1 pound of silver divided into 20

parts which become known as solidy or shillings, right?

Uh, that's Latin for coin, um, and then each shilling

is in further subdivided into 12 pence, right?

Which is becomes denoted confusingly by ad from the Latin

denarius, which means silver coin, and then actually you can

divide that um.

And into quarters and those become farthings.

Uh, and actually, I don't think there's ever any farthing

coins minted, people would just chop them into 4 quarters.

Um, anyway, if they needed small change.

So, Actually, these pins were for a very long period

of time, the only coin that circulates, right?

So 1 pound is 20 shillings and there's 12 pence

in a shilling.

Therefore, 240 pence is 1 pound.

Um, and now you run into one of the bottlenecks.

Uh, you know, monetization is great.

It's much more efficient than a You know, exclusively bartered

in-kind system.

But when you know, the initial money systems where the

only currency is actually a penny.

If you had to have 15 pennies in your pocket,

as opposed to uh bigger coins, it becomes difficult, but

also don't forget.

That those 240 pennies, they weigh 1 pound, right?

So if you need to transport 20 pounds worth of

pennies in order to buy something of significant value, all

of a sudden you've got a wagon full of pennies,

very heavy, very difficult to manage, and very easy to

rob, right?

This is why the bishop of Winchester, the king orders

him when the king is coming through.

Uh, parts of Hampshire.

He orders the bishop of Winchester to cut back all

the brush from the, uh, cut back all the brush

from the road so that bandits can't hide and rob

them because, you know, when people are travelling around in

the Middle Ages with this much cash in pennies, uh,

you're kind of a sitting duck for um robbers anyway,

so yeah, and ultimately I mean we don't need to

worry about this too much, this goes back to Babylon,

uh, but.

We end up with uh higher value points being introduced

to address this problem, right?

So you can do bigger transactions.

Uh, with less hassle, right?

Higher value coins sometimes coming as gold, right?

So here we have the Florentine Florin, uh, issued by,

you know, one of these great Italian city states, Florence.

uh, Genoa has their own coin from around the same

period, um, Venice has the Duca, uh, very famously, um.

And here's a much later 18th century coin, right?

Here's an example of a gold coin of Edward the

Third, uh, issued in England, and here is, uh, Richard

the Lionheart's penny from the 12th century.

English pennies often have this cross thing and you could

still find these in England, right?

They get found regularly if, if like.

If mediaeval coins are like what get you hot and

bothered, you can, you can own these, right?

They're, they're available at coin dealers for purchase.

You could, you could have one like on your bedroom

wall.

Um, but I don't have any.

Do you have any groat.

Oh, OK, OK.

What's, what's what unit of account of the groat?

1414 shillings, OK.

So not a mark, but close.

Yeah, OK.

Anyway, we won't talk about marks yet.

Uh, I mean, are marks.

They're never minted.

Yeah, so to make things even more complicated, I say

like you can devote your life to this, and some

people do.

Um, it's a unit of account.

They also sometimes have units of account that don't exist

in real money, but if you want to hear more

about that, you can speak to Greg because he's uh.

Um, but who was it that was talking about money

influencing crisis over here, yeah.

Uh, so actually what you start to see.

Is that.

You know, money works as a system of account, right?

And it's very uh Important for the development of markets

and the development of commercialization what are markets, if anything

other than just information gathering and sending, uh.

Devices, right?

So now when you're paying and exchanging things in cash,

you got a number of exchanges and the market kind

of starts to determine what the price is.

But as I mentioned with the example of the Black

Death, you can also get reverse causality, right?

The availability of money.

Um, starts to influence prices.

Right?

So an example of this.

Uh, would be from 13th century England, right?

Um, where they have to reissue the coinage.

More on that in a second, but that basically means

the king of England.

Takes all of the silver pennies in, melts them all

down, and issues new silver pennies, because the currency that

had been in circulation had become debased.

Um, but what that means is that you have a

shock, right?

Think of a vertical line on an X-axis, right?

And the price of an aux, let's just say is

12 shillings.

Um, before the, before the coinage is reissued.

Then immediately after, like, you know, days after the coinage

gets reissued, well, the price of an ox is now

9 shilling.

Why is that?

Because, you know, the coinage had lost.

Um, content through debasement, silver had been removed from each

coin.

Um, so, you know, 12 shillings did not contain as

much silver before, uh, the Reissuing.

So basically, you reissue the coinage, it affects prices, um,

but you end up with long waves of inflation and

deflation, right?

And actually, this is really, really interesting, uh, and it

introduces the concept of money, uh, monetary factors as an

explanation for the long run trends, right?

Because until quite recently, uh, economists didn't believe that money

mattered at all.

Uh, 19th century classical economists did not think that money,

you know, in any epoch could influence prices.

They said money was a veil that simply disguises the

operations of the real economy, right?

So this is what we talked about.

It's just a unit of account, it's just a store

of value.

It's just a medium of exchange.

It shouldn't have any um fundamental influence on how that

exchange actually happens other than to make it easier.

Right, but as in that example I just demonstrated, there

are channels through which uh money can influence the economy

influence prices specifically, right?

So, uh, this is first articulated, um, maybe by Mark

Block, um.

Right, the famous mediaeval historian, tragically murdered by the Nazis,

uh, but now we basically have a debate in the

literature about real versus monetary factors.

Mark Wak says the monetary phenomena act like a peculiar

seismograph, right?

What's a seismograph?

Anybody know?

Yeah, measures seismic activity.

It's that like, you know, ticker tape with the squiggly

thing that, you know, measures earthquakes.

um, anyway, so you know, one that not only res

earth tremors but sometimes helps bring them about as with

that illustrated example of the reissuing of the coin as

I told you about, right?

Um, so.

Like I said, you have long ways and price trends

that go through inflationary periods and deflationary periods.

We're all far too familiar over the last little while

with an inflationary period we're living through one right now.

Um.

You know, there was a time where if somebody tried

to charge me £4 for a coffee, I would have

like walked out.

And now I'm like that's reasonable.

Uh, anyway, so this first phase, uh, in the so-called

commercial revolution, when mediaeval markets start to get increasingly monetized,

increasingly commercialised, right, lots of economic growth, uh, expanding populations,

but also expanding money supplies, right?

Because you have a boom in silver mining.

There's lots of silver to be mined, lots of money

to be minted.

Um, right, so it's an inflationary period.

It reaches its peak at the beginning of the pardon

me, 14th century, um.

And also this is augmented by gold coming in from

Africa, hm.

And what the first question for our 3rd.

Formative essay is was the pre-industrial world globalised while here

in this commercial revolution, inflationary phase from, you know, the

12th century to the 14th.

Also, you know, a factor in that is the expanding

trade with Byzantium and Islamic caliphates in the Mid East.

Middle East and North Africa.

OK, so then we know this, we know this if

you can remember back before Christmas, uh, we're talking about

population and resources, right?

Well, what happens in the early 14th century?

Well, you start to get the peak of population pressure

on resources.

Population starts to decline because living standards have eroded, uh,

in Northern Europe you have the Great Famine and successive.

Number of very wet years, very bad harvests, maybe 15

or 20% of the European population starved to death, right?

Um, evidence of demographic decline all over, uh, Europe, right?

So now we're coming to the end of this commercial

revolution, right?

All of a sudden.

You get uh the Pope, um, intervening in trade with

the Middle East, uh, the geopolitical situation in the Middle

East becomes quite a bit more uh turbulent.

You get wars that break up to the kingdom of

Venice and the kingdom of Genoa, um, you get the

Ottomans conquering parts of Byzantium, uh, you got, you know,

the Mongols attacking Italian colonies, uh, so all of a

sudden, right, things are.

Uh, I mean this is maybe a little bit too

close to home now when we think about 2025 because

inflation, uh, destabilised geopolitical, uh, situation, you know, where is

this going?

We're headed to recession.

Where are we going in 2025?

Who knows?

Uh, anyway, but lots, lots of instability.

Uh, so anyway, it all ends up with the perspective

of centuries of hindsight, uh, to be a classic phase

B deflationary period, right?

Uh, lots of warfare, uh, falling population, the money supply

contracts, uh, right, and although there is some like short

term noise which general deflationary trend.

OK, so that's how money, you know, can work with

some of these other factors to influence, you know, inflationary

and deflationary trends.

Um, How was the coined money supply increased, right?

Well, basically, you had to either mine more precious metal

from your own territory or your neighbours had to, or

you had to.

Uh, create a positive balance of trade, right?

This is what mercantilists are interested in the 18th century.

It's what Donald Trump is interested in today, right?

It's just that export revenues exceed the cost of imports

and therefore you get lots of gold coming into your

country.

The other way is by coinage debasements, right?

So you increase the number of coins.

Uh, that, you know, that are produced with a certain

amount of precious metal, right, that, uh, creates, increases the

money supply, right?

Now this debasement uh can happen in two ways.

Right, so these rulers who issue the coinage often charges,

you know, uh, a fee called seniorage, right, to produce

them.

So there is, you know, not only does issuing the

coinage kind of establish you as an authority within some

kind of territory, there's money to be made for the

Lord who's doing this as well, right?

They're just charging a fee that's probably more than their

costs to turn precious metal into coin.

Um, but you know, the one thing that's probably certain

about most lords is that they're never going to, uh,

overlook an opportunity to make money.

If you're in charge of turning precious metal into coins,

you can take a bigger fee if you debase the

coinage furnished by making more coins out of less, uh,

precious metal, right?

And they do this by adding more low value metal

into the mixture that they're minting.

Um, and it basically creates a divergence between, you know,

what the coin says it's worth on the face value

and what the intrinsic value of the precious metal in

that coin might be.

Um, Now, Running a little bit behind time, so I'm

gonna start zipping through this stuff, but it'll be on

the Moodle if you want to see it.

Uh, why is this debasement problematic if the people who

issue coins are debasing them?

Well, basically this is explained by a concept called aggressions

law which says that people will choose to spend the

worst money, right?

If I have coin A that um.

You know, says it's worth 1 shilling but has only

10 grammes of silver in it.

I mean it wouldn't actually have 10 grammes of 1

gramme of silver, whatever.

And I have another coin that also says it's worth

1 shilling but contains proportionately less silver.

I'm going to spend that coin first because the coin

has intrinsic value.

I can melt it down, you know, I can do

whatever I want with it, um, and this is what

happens.

If you debase your currency, it gets pushed out, it

creates price inflation.

Right?

Because sellers will raise their prices because they don't believe

that the money that they're receiving in payment has the

same value as it used to do, right?

So this concept existed from the 14th century, uh.

But this guy named Gresham who uh worked in Elizabeth

in England is a kind of what it becomes named

after he says basically cheap money will drive out expensive

money, right?

Um, so, Why do lords do this, right?

Do they do it to expand the money supply, or

do they do it, which might be, might be trying

to do a kind of pre-industrial intervention, uh, pre-industrial monetary

policy, expanding the money classly can be good to facilitate

exchange, um, or are they just doing it in a

kind of extractive way to earn more money for themselves,

right?

This is an open question in the literature, it's debate

it actively, right?

Um, now, Uh, the problem with mediaeval coins is that

no two coins look the same, and this is why

I was asking you about the ridges, our modern coins

and illustrating the ridges, uh, that existed on.

Pre-modern coins, it's to stop people from debasing the coinage

themselves.

You've probably started to think along these lines as I've

been talking.

Coin clipping is just, let's say every time you get

a penny in your pocket, you just cut a little

bit of the edge off.

In the end, you have a quantity of silver that

can be melted down, yet the coin you just clipped

and then used to pay for something, you know, has

been debased.

So you, you're basically stealing.

It was a capital offence.

You know, you would, you, you would get hanged for

doing this, uh, if you got if you got caught,

but this is a problem with the coinage, and it's

why, you know, we still have these ridges on the

edges of coins, although our coins aren't made of precious

metal anymore, so there's no point in going home and

clipping the edges off a, uh, 10 pence piece, um,

but it's kind of a vistigial trace something they do

in their minting to try to make coins that they

identifiable, right?

um.

OK.

So yeah, these are private means of debasing the coins,

right?

Uh, and the minting technology improves over time to try

to uh protect against this engineer against this, but it's

never fully successful, right?

This is our artwork of the week.

Um, uh, well, I actually don't know if it's artwork

of the week.

It's and artwork, but you can go see the Louv.

Uh, you should.

Did you see it when you were in Peder?

Um, not this time.

OK, maybe next time.

Anyway, uh, so, Now that we have kind of elevated

monetary factors to having some influence on the economy, we

might ask, did shortages of precious metal influence the economy,

right?

Were they related to demographic decline, uh, you know, were

they?

About the use of credit, how does this work, right?

Well, we have to think about where the sources of,

you know, precious metals come from silver is typically coming

domestically from within Europe.

Uh, gold, you know, did get produced a bit, uh,

in Europe, but mostly from, uh, imported from abroad, right?

So you can see where all the silver mines in,

uh, Western Europe are.

Some of its Eastern Europe, I guess, actually.

And um.

One of the reasons that the city states of Italy

do so well is that they're very well positioned not

only for trade, but also to uh receive gold that

is mined in Africa, right?

Coming in these kinds of places.

Anyway, I won't, um.

Won't go into too much detail about the mining, but

basically these mines run out of precious metal eventually, right?

And then if your money is based on precious metal

and you've run out of precious metal, all of a

sudden all of these advantages that you have had enjoyed

from the monetization of your economy become more difficult because

you can't.

Act, you have a scarcity of coin.

So all of a sudden you have to start trying

to pay your labourers once more with grain because you

cannot get your hands on that coin to pay them,

right?

Um, it becomes a problem.

And basically, you can just see how volatile uh mint

production was, right?

The, the money supply was not assured.

Right, um, and there's a number of different ways that

an economy could find itself short of coin, right?

Uh, mines can run dry if you're shipping a bunch

of money, um, on a ship and the ship sinks,

you lose that money, right?

So even though a monetized economy with coins of precious

metal are a huge improvement over barter, they're still very,

very vulnerable and, you know, to.

Uh, boolean famines, but also because I said of the

bulk and the weight, there are in many ways a

bottleneck for large scale transactions, right?

Um.

Uh, this is what I was talking about before, uh,

that shows, you know, how the per capita money supply

increases dramatically after the Black Death.

That's not because the total number of coins in circulation

had changed, just that the number of people had been

cut by 50%, right?

Um, so, and that basically the plague creates a lot

of inflation, which we can see here.

This is evidence from, uh, the low country slumish commodity

prices, right?

Um, OK.

So, I'm just going to move on to this here.

I thought I had too many slides and then I

thought, well, I can probably get through them.

Um, but Uh, one final point.

Despite the monetization of the commercial revolution, right, this comes

from my own research, uh, the role of in-kind payment,

even when there's lots of money around, remains important, right?

So this blue line is the proportion of wages being

paid in green to agriculture and labourers in mediaeval England.

The red line is just adding the cash wage in

green to the blue one, anyway, 2/3 of.

Agricultural labor's wages are paid in kind still, right?

Only 1/3 in cash.

So then we get the introduction of non-precious metal coins,

right?

Um, tries to fix the problem that they're bulky and

heavy and vulnerable to uh theft, right?

Um.

This was often issued by private banks, uh, and this

in a later period further grow the money supply, right?

We first get this in the 17th century, uh, first

in Sweden and then in England, right?

So that's the kind of chronology, right?

For most of our period right up until the 17th

century, you have coinage space.

Almost exclusively point coinage-based systems, right?

And then you get paper money coming in later.

Um, what I want to focus on here is also

an earlier development for large scale transactions called the bill

of exchange.

Because as I said, if you want to do a

large scale transaction, you want to buy, you know, some

farmer's wool for the next 10 years.

It's you know, hundreds if not thousands of pounds.

You cannot take thousands of pounds very easily from Italy

to, you know, uh, Norwich, right?

Uh, it just does not work.

Um, but what gets developed.

Which I think is probably quite surprising is an early

form of cashless payment called the bill of exchange, right?

Uh, and basically, you know, commodities get exchanged for the

bill and the money is worked out later, um, and

it can work in multiple currencies so you can actually

pay or play the foreign exchange market.

These like great banking families like the Bardi and the

Medici, they have established a very, uh.

Integrated network of foreign exchange offices so they know what

the, you know, the exchange rate between a British pound

and a, you know, Florentine florin is in the 14th

century basically right down to the day, uh, and because

of that, uh, you can facilitate at least for large

scale transactions, uh, paperless or I mean not paperless, uh,

cashless paper transactions, right, um, which facilitate large scale purchases.

Um There's a really well established credit market in the

mediaeval period as well, and this could be right down

to small scale pawnbroking, to mortgages on land, to huge

amounts of money borrowed by rulers, uh, kings, and things,

you know, in order to go to war.

Um, it's an interesting question of whether it's a good

policy to loan money to despots or not because it

often isn't repaid, um.

But there's lots of work on this, uh, you know,

at all, you know, this is just focusing on, you

know, small scale transactions.

This is focusing on very large scale transactions, um.

The other thing that I want to mention before we

get going is that the existence of a monetary system.

The existence of credit.

Uh, implies that there are prevailing interest rates, right?

Uh, so the mediaeval people were very aware of the

concept of interest rates and how that worked, um, and

ultimately, uh.

These decline over the course of the Middle Ages probably

because the mechanisms to enforce contracts improved, uh, and the

credit market became more robust so you can see how

interest rates you know are declining here uh over the

course of the uh Middle Ages.

All right, um, public debt is basically just bonds, right?

There was a market for that in, uh, the mediaeval

world as well.

Uh, you know, the Italian city states developed these forced

loans, uh, which would pay interest back to people, which

is kind of a quasi bond.

Um, but as I said, this relies on the trust

that political elites are going to keep up payments, which

isn't always the case, um, but you can see that

this is starting quite early as well, uh, going back

into at least the 13th century.

Um, so I spent too much on coins and not

enough on the bill of exchange and uh the credit

market, um, but the slides are there if you want

to go over it and I'm happy to take any

uh questions, um, but basically.

These financial instruments, first coins derived from precious metal, and

then from things like the bill of exchange, right, uh,

they do a lot for the mediaeval economy.

They make even the smallest transactions possible, um.

The paper or cashless exchanges make large transactions possible, right?

This is allows the mediaeval economy to use uh capital

effectively and improve the efficiency of exchange, right, especially once

you get a credit market that comes online, then capital

can be moved to more.

to parts of the economy, right, commodity money solves this

problem, this bottleneck of barter, uh, provides a store of

value, you know, you can, we, we're still digging up

coin hordes, right?

Uh, people that buried their money in the ground because,

you know, they wanted to come back and get it

later but never managed to.

That's only possible if we have coins as a store

of value because you couldn't, you know.

Bury 100 sheep, and come back later and get them.

Um, and Uh You can see the various social and

political issues uh that start to impinge on the money

supply and the money uh monetary factors and monetary policy

itself becomes a driving force, especially when we get into

the early modern period and beyond.

Thank you.

I Oh.

I Yeah.

Right.

I know.

Yeah.

I.

you see a guy that just I I didn't see

you in the back.

I came in and I was like.

I'll put a reminder on my phone.

So at that point.

Um.

The I know there's two people that yeah, yeah, the

woman and the, I like the.

I like

Lecture 12:

Invite me Yeah I don't think you want me as

a coach.

I think you want me as like your 13th ho.

Yeah OK, nothing bad.

Just uh all up there.

Is there any That No The That's good.

But I mean if you want to bounce ideas off.

OK Yeah.

I I'm actually OK.

Made up of what we were doing.

Yeah qual All right.

How's everybody doing?

Uh, that was Bachman Turner Overdrive, uh, from Winnipeg, Manitoba,

uh, National Treasure, Canada, um, it's like Bachman Turner Overdrive,

Celine Dion, I mean it depends who you talk to,

but anyways, um, so.

Today, uh, well, today we want to take care of

business, I think.

So one of the things we haven't talked about yet

directly that becomes more and more important, or at least

enters, increasingly enters the discourse.

Of economic history, once you transition into the um early

modern period, and definitely into the modern period, is business,

right?

And actually, I mean, I was puzzling with Greg about

this a couple of minutes ago and before that, I

think, you know, while I reviewing my slides this morning

I was trying to think like.

What actually defines business from just commerce or trade or

something.

The thing that Greg is going to pick up, uh,

when he gives a lecture in a few weeks' time.

Does anybody have any ideas what might differentiate business?

You know, uh, from any of the concepts that we've

discussed so far.

I'm asking you to speculate here, so speculate wildly.

Anybody?

But what is, how, how is, how does business differentiate

from trade?

What, what pops into your mind when I say business

versus what is already in your mind, uh, from the

course so far?

OK, I like that.

I like that.

Uh, profit motivation, right?

Um, and I think that will probably definitely come into

what Greg is saying there is.

An argument.

The mediaeval economic history about let's say these huge agricultural

operations the degree to which they were profit motivated, right,

um, and if you think about the other side of

the economy, the peasant economy, there's generally a kind of

theoretical debate about whether peasants, uh, produce for themselves for

subsistence or do they produce a surplus for the market

and therefore, you know, something that could be vaguely, um.

Vaguely.

Construed to be profit.

So I like that maybe business is oriented around profit,

uh.

I'm not sure if it works the other way around,

that non-business is nonprofit, but that's a good place to

start.

Any other ideas?

Yeah.

Yeah.

OK.

Our business and innovation correlated?

Uh, yeah, maybe commerce, you know, I exchange for things

that are already, you know, within markets that already exist

and business or just new markets perhaps I like that.

Any other ideas?

I'm starting to think that like what is the difference

between, you know, business history and economic history, uh, would

be a fruitful essay question.

Um, do you have anything to add to this debate?

Not not off the top of your head.

That's right, that's right.

Business is the broader.

Bus encompasses can encompass.

We can trade encompass business anyway, uh, so we can

look forward to Greg delving into this a bit more.

Um, so what I want to do today is just

sketch out again over many centuries, the evolution of things

that we might now understand as business, right?

Um.

I mean, one of the answers I was thinking about

this question on my way here is whether business is

kind of an anachronistic term, right?

Does anybody know what I mean when I say something's

anachronistic or anachronism?

Yeah, which way does it work?

Forward backwards Yeah, it's taking a concept from Uh, the

present and projecting it on to the past, you know,

with the perhaps erroneous assumption that it works in the

past, right?

So, Is business just kind of a modern innovation or

a modern idea that we might try to impose on

the past, and I think this would be the problem.

Sorry, what's your name?

This might be, you know, really interesting if you try

to project business too far back do we understand business

to be oriented around creating profit or maybe creating new

markets, right?

Uh, and if you were to apply that to the

mediaeval period, you know, uh, a sensitive historian might say,

uh, wait a second, they didn't even understand profit as

a concept yet, so therefore you can't use business, right?

So there's a lot of, um, you know.

Semantics here, we need to think about.

I don't think, and I welcome any of you to

challenge me on this, either in lecture or in an

essay.

I'm not sure business is a clear, you know, paradigm

or lens or causal channel.

Um To economic growth, uh, because I think as Greg

was saying it encompasses things we've already talked about like

trade and growth and things like that.

So I tend to think of business as.

Uh, understanding how these aspects of the economy increasingly started

to fit together, especially in the early modern period and

beyond, uh, once you get more of the global economy

integrated, um, but I mean it's another open question and

I, I always think this course is more about, it

will create more questions than it does answers.

um, could you argue that, you know, business is a.

You know, in a lens of equal importance like demography

is to understanding the development of economies, um, perhaps, uh,

anyway, so.

Despite what I said, uh, Hunton Murray wrote this book

on mediaeval business, uh, and they started off by saying

it's the most powerful revolutionary force that Europe has unleashed

on to the rest of the world.

I'm not sure I agree with that.

You might, so, uh, it's good to have a little

bit of uh back and forth on this, um, but

they see mediaeval business growing at the intersection of elite

demand and peasant agriculture, right?

And these are things we've already covered, right, like what,

uh, you know.

Elite demand for spices and uh war horses forge links

between Europe and the East, right?

But you still also have to feed the local population,

so peasants, you can never really escape peasant agriculture, um.

They have a clever turn of phrase where they say,

you know, business adapts to conditions and then ultimately transform

those conditions.

Sorry, what's your name?

I think this is maybe kind of what you're getting

at or or similar to the point you were making

in terms of if it's transforming the conditions of a

paradigm in which it originally arose, that could be kind

of business as a dynamic force creating new markets, whatever.

So that's the scene.

This is what we're going to do.

We'll talk about the kind of context, business environment, we'll

get into a little bit of, uh, game theory, trying

to understand the fundamental problem of exchange and how businesses,

you know, uh, in air quotes, um.

Solve that problem, uh, last week when I talked about

money, uh, I didn't quite enough time to get into,

uh, kind of non-cash exchanges, specifically the bill of exchange,

but that's fortuitous because we're talking about it again today

because that's a mechanism that really facilitates the growth of

businesses, uh, and then we'll talk about a number of

different kinds of organisation, right?

When I think of business, I often think of a,

a company or a corporation or an organisation, um, it

has to be uh.

You know, several people, uh, and at some scale, uh,

that might, I mean there's a lot of people who

run businesses just by themselves, uh, but, uh, anyway, so

I, I've sketched together a number of different, you know,

firms and, uh, things like that to try to understand

what the structure of mediaeval and early modern business looked

like, uh, then we kind of transition into what the

business environment was from the mediaeval period into the early

modern period, how did the world change.

And then I think we're going to talk about joint

stock companies, right?

Um, which might be the beginning of what we now

understand to be, uh, you know, how a big business

works, um, you know.

Yeah here OK, so all of this stuff we talked

about already, right?

This is the context where we start.

Roman Empire breaks down or at least the western part

does in the early Middle Ages, uh, you get migrations

from outside Europe into Europe.

The Islamic world grows, uh, there's a very important role

of church and monasteries as an institution, you know, monitoring

and has its hands in most of, uh, corporal things.

In the high Middle Ages, you get an expansion of

population, all of this, all of these advances in agriculture.

Um, you get the, you know, kernels of Western European

states arising.

You have the crusades which you talked about, you know,

are important for forging trade links, um, and then in

the late Middle Ages you have a whole bunch of

demographic shocks, right?

We get the decline of serfdom, um, agriculture increasingly is

focused on provi uh, you know, raising animals and providing

meat and dairy, uh, for people's diets they're changing tastes

are changing.

And you get a number of uh innovations that perhaps

are positive productivity shocks to the economy, right?

This is this thing.

So Those who, you know, want to see the mediaeval

world, uh, the kind of antecedents of modern business will

say that, uh, demand for luxury goods is what kind

of drives the origins of mediaeval businesses, right?

So you don't have mediaeval business, you don't have these

Italian companion.

You don't have any of them, uh, without wealthy people

demanding nice things.

And, and of course like that is, you know, a

big part of uh what business history today.

There's still a big luxury goods industry.

It just is handbags instead of spicy.

Ferrari Um, As we've already said, you know, the Mediterranean

basin was initially the centre of commerce, uh, then it

shifts to Northwest Europe.

We know this already, um, and this is, you know,

connected to that pastoral agriculture, right?

Northern European eating habits, you know, bring further changes, right?

No Um, whether it's commerce or whether it's business, I

think you could probably argue, uh, but you know the

idea of a free trade zone, uh, and, you know,

The importance of facilitating commerce is well known to societies

and economies, right?

Um, Romans created the Roman peace, A Romana, uh, the

facilitated free trade within the boundaries of the empire.

Um, what this does is connected to the last bit,

right, diets, uh, I keep bringing this back.

I think in another life I should have been a

food historian maybe, but anyway, uh, what this does is

permits the spread of the Mediterranean diet, you know, all

around the Roman Empire, right, uh, and that direct agricultural

endeavours, etc.

etc.

you get specialisation of particular kinds of crops, you get

the rise of, uh, transport infrastructure.

I showed you previously that you know trade map of

the Roman Empire, um.

So all of this, you know, ends up, you know,

culminating in these things hundreds and hundreds of years later,

uh, commercial revolution period, you know, maybe that you relying

on the infrastructure, the Roman roads, the idea of free

trade, the acceptance that market orientation is advantageous.

Right, despite the fact that the Roman Empire, uh, the

west part that had dissolved, you know, six centuries ago,

around 1100, you get this period that, you know, comes

to be known as the commercial revolution.

So basically from 1100, uh, up until maybe the industrial

revolution, right?

I don't use this term that much because I'm not

sure how much utility it actually has, because what does

it start to sound like?

It starts to sound like things were good in Rome.

Uh, then the Roman Empire collapsed and for six centuries,

you know, Europe is a backwater until, uh, you know,

the Dark Ages, some light starts to shine on the

Dark Ages.

It's just because the commercial revolution idea starts in around

1100, you're pushing that light back from the Renaissance to,

uh, the 12th century.

Lots of interregional trade, um, you know, not only in

the Mediterranean but in the Baltic area we talked about

that before, uh, this spurs a lot of urbanisation which

we'll talk about in the future lecture, um, and it's

a big, you know, boom, especially in wholesale trade which

we talked about before we looked at fairs.

What we haven't talked about so much is that this

is facilitated uh by credit, so credit relationships become increasingly

important.

Um, so Very, very integrated, right?

We've looked before at the Boulevard, kind of trading circuits

that integrated the known world, everything except the Americas, basically,

um, this doesn't look that different from the Roman network,

uh, expanded up here a bit, um, but Europe is

very well integrated, right?

So, that's the environment.

When we start to consider uh the emergence.

Now There's a little bit of a puzzle, right?

Uh, trade creates wealth through the channel of smithing growth,

all of this stuff, right?

division of labour, specialisation, allocation of risk, etc.

etc.

um, but this is also, uh, a period that we,

you know, of, you know, a lot of violence, a

lot of political fragmentation, very high transportation costs, especially over

land, um, especially before they start using horses.

Uh, information travels slowly and imperfectly, so you get a

lot of information asymmetries.

Um, if, if, you know, how is trade possible in

this environment of uncertainty?

Right.

How, if, if we know, you know, that Europe was

very well integrated, at least in terms of transport infrastructure,

how and why, you know, somebody here uh in the

Middle East.

How would they be able to trade with Western Europe,

uh, facing all of this uncertainty, right?

You don't know these people, they don't speak the same

language as you.

You know, they, you know, especially early on, they might

not have the same God as you, you know, the

Baltic doesn't become Christianized until the 14th century, right?

So you Christians are the pagans, um, Muslims and Christians,

all of this stuff.

How, how do you, if you think about it, how

does trade happen right when the world is archaic, anarchic,

and, uh, information moves slowly, right?

So, this is where game theory kind of comes in,

um, and The idea kind of most famously articulated by

right, uh, basically you can model this with a very

simple game theory thinking about a set of possible actions,

right, strategic behaviour, um.

And it allows you to indulge, you know, examine endogenously

motivated behaviour, right?

Uh.

So It basically, you know, gets used in economics to

study why individuals tend to follow particular rules, how is

property secured, How are contracts fulfilled if you don't have,

you know, well established courts and a universal law book

to keep everybody.

Be accountable to the same set of rules, um, so

you're looking at different equilibria shared beliefs that motivate that,

uh, this is essentially boils down to what new institutional

economics calls like the rules of the game and institution,

right?

So the fundamental problem, uh, as Gre describes it is

how do people trust enough to trade, right?

Why would you give something up.

Uh, with the uncertainty that you would receive something back

later.

Uh, exchange often takes place sequentially, right, especially if there's

credits involved, especially if you're trying to finance something, you

know, maybe you're financing an overseas trading voyage, you know,

in a with a, you know, a lot of goods

and a ship, um, maybe you're entering into partnerships with

partners who have input and but will take a share

of the profit.

There's a lot of trust that has to happen here,

right?

In its most simple terms, in a world where you

have kind of two merchants, it breaks down something like

this, right?

Because it happens sequentially, merchant one first has to decide,

will they trade or will they not trade.

If there's no trade, you know, both players receive nothing,

right?

Um, if you do trade, there's a potential for gain,

but only if Merchant 2 cooperates.

Merchant 2, right, can rene, uh, they win, you lose,

right?

So ultimately it all comes down to whether player two,

merchant 2, decides to cheat merchant one or not.

Um, so.

Merchant two can decide not to cooperate, take all of

the game, but merchant one, you know, is not a

dumb person, so they anticipate this and they decide not

to trade at all, so the outcome is no trade,

right?

So.

This again why would you put your hard earned, you

know, assets, money, whatever on the line when you know

it all depends on whether this other person is going

to live up to their, uh, side of the promise

or not, especially if they'd be better off cheating.

Um, My, my daughter used to be involved in a

lot of like playground trades involving hair clips and like

playing cards and things.

Just trying to wonder if I need to explain this

to her at some point.

She's 3 right now, so might be a few months,

but, uh, anyway, merchant 2 would be better off if

both decided to cooperate, right?

So then how do you get merchant one to trade?

So basically, how do you convince merchant to to commit

ex ante and to be honest ex posts?

That's the problem, um, and it needs an institutional solution

or so.

Uh, I would argues, you need some way for people

to trust each other.

And I think this is.

Not totally absent from our modern world, right?

Uh, There just is more of an apparatus now, you

know, with our rule of law, at least theoretically for

some people, um, and other mechanisms, right, eBay has the,

uh, feedback report, um, I'm trying to think of an

environment in the 21st century where you have to fully

trust somebody, right?

Um, maybe if you go to like a market and

you leave your phone to have the screen replaced, you

know, not by the Apple store, but by somebody who

says they can do it, uh, for a fraction of

the price, and you're just hoping you get your phone

back or you get the same phone back.

Um, maybe that's like a reputational mechanism or something like

that, right, where you're assuming this person's reputation and ability

to conduct business in, you know, the market, you know,

is trustworthy, um, but even then the existence of a

formal market an agreed place where merchants congregate and customers

come, you know, is an apparatus that might not exist

in this, um, world that.

is being described by Ed Wright.

Uh, so he has this very, very famous article.

Um, it should be on the further reading list.

If it's not, I'll put it there this afternoon.

Uh, so he observed that Jewish merchants in the Mediterranean

were engaged in long distance trade.

So he's asking, how did this work?

How did these people conduct business, um, in an environment

of uncertainty.

Uh, these people had come, um, from Baghdad to North

Africa, uh, in the 10th century.

And they use overseas agents in order to trade with

Europe, right?

So the agents received the goods, uh, from Africa, they

buy them and sell them on, uh, and then send

new goods or or profit back to Africa.

So it's overseas trade, uh, in the early Middle Ages,

right?

And how did these people trust each other enough to

engage in commerce, um.

There's no international law, right?

Uh, so he argues that there's basically a closed ethnic

trading network.

Mutual monitoring, mutual punishment, and this is a reputation-based solution

to the fundamental problem of exchange, right?

As you go on in economic history, you're gonna be

hearing an increasing amount about the institutions, right, new institutional

economics, I love Douglas North, right.

Rules of the game.

Um, this is kind of one of those ideas.

Par excellence, um, so it's a very, very famous article.

The problem with the McGreevy traders, uh, is one of

evidence really because this whole grand theory, which is very,

very persuasive, and I'm sure I've told you before, if

you see something that's very, very persuasive.

First thing you should do is ask, you know what

kind of evidence is being used here.

It's based entirely on two letters in an archive somewhere,

right?

This whole grand, you know, uh, trading world underpinned with

evidence of two letters, not that much, um, but it's

an interesting, interesting articulation of one of these arguments, uh,

because in game game theory terms, uh it's a solution

to the commitment problem in in repeated games in, in

an environment of asymmetric information.

Because, right, you have these agents who are working for

you in Europe, um, and you only hire them if

they have been honest in the past.

Don't hire them again if they cheated, and that was,

that's what gets player to to commit, right?

Because it's a repeated game.

They could cheat, uh.

And you know, reap all of the rewards, uh, take

all of the goods, give nothing back, but then they

don't get to do business with you again.

So, They understand it's a repeated game, right?

So I think maybe it is what Donald Trump is

missing with this like reneging of foreign aid.

He doesn't maybe understand that it's a repeated gate because

you know there's only something you do once but anyway

we have mercantilism next week.

Mercantilism is basically Donald Trump hate policies, so it's very,

very appropriate.

Uh, anyway, there's a reporting mechanism, right?

This group will, you know, grass on each other, uh,

if they see people cheating, um, and not only do

you agree not to hire somebody if they cheated you,

but you agree not to hire uh somebody if they

treated cheated somebody else in your group, right?

This is collective punishment.

Uh, now this strategy only works if the payment is

high enough because you have to incentivize somebody that is

worth playing by the rules in order to get future

opportunities, right?

If one transaction is so big that one time cheating

is more profitable than returning the fold, then the whole

system doesn't work.

Right.

Um, so, He argues that the institutional solution is supported

by historical documents that show very little if any opportunistic

behaviour, the absence of formal courts, right?

um.

And also there's a business that exists only within this

network, right, the closed ethnic group, uh, that have agreed

to work together institutional solution to this fundamental problem of

exchange.

Um, other people have come along and have said, actually,

it's not as clear and as clean as uh.

I would have you believe, um, because other people since

Greg wrote this article have said, actually, I think there

is opportunism, people do renee.

Uh, and also that there probably was formal corps existing

alongside this, so maybe the institutional solution is these reputational

mechanisms are not as necessary as great as you believe,

right, um, and actually it wasn't a close ethnic group

with only Jewish people because the people from all sorts

of backgrounds, uh, engaged in this, right, um.

Anyway, uh, I could go home and on the grievy

traders.

I won't, uh, but that is the situation.

Um, there's other solutions, right?

You don't have to have a closed ethnic group, uh,

you could, in, in general and in Venice, there's other

public institutions, public order, uh, things and other reputation best

mechanisms.

So McGrey trader is only one solution you would expect

a range of solutions to, you know, when everybody face

the same problem.

Um, OK, so bills of exchange, you started this yesterday,

uh, last week, rather, we'll talk about it some more,

um, this right alleviates that bottleneck of needing to move

very bulky, very unwieldy, very heavy amounts of cash for

large scale transactions, right, um.

And also it is because in uh most of the

kind of orthodox uh religious, uh, Paradigms of the time,

charging interest is not allowed.

Uh, because canonical law outlaws the taking of interest, uh,

in both Christianity and in Islam, right, uh, Christianity they

call it usury, um, it's why, you know, Western European

nations are, you know, invite Jews in is to function

because the same rules don't apply to Jews, right?

Uh, so it's an issue to kind of work around,

uh, prohibitions against charging of interest and also a way

to transfer money without moving gold and silver around, um,

and.

They rise in Italy, Spain, right, uh, parts of England

and the Netherlands, uh, so it's not a universal phenomenon,

uh, in early, you know, stages of this in the

mediaeval period only integrating some of the leading economies.

It works something like this, right?

uh.

You know, this guy in Bruges lends money to another

guy in Bruges in return for a piece of paper,

a bill, uh, this guy sends the bill, uh, to

somebody in Germany, um.

And he presents the bill to the payer, uh, who's

also in Germany, who repays the money, so it's a

very like slick system that allows transactions to occur without,

uh, cash needing to change hands between everybody involved.

Uh, the benefits of this are pretty obvious, right?

Brings together capital and labour, it's further specialisation.

You also get to be able to do business without

having to be at the same place at the same

time as all the other people involved in the transaction,

right?

Like, do not underestimate uh the importance.

Or how big of a deal that is, right?

Travel is difficult.

Travel is dangerous, um, you, uh, so not having to

be all the same place at once, uh, is advantageous,

um, and this also is a risk allocation risk kind

of hedging, uh.

Tool as well.

Um, there's other things in addition to the bill of

exchange.

Things we might now call financial instruments that exist, right?

So, I see loan, this exists in in Italy from

the 12th century before, uh, you know, the guy who

is boarding the ship receives credit, um, and then you

have to pay it back, uh, when he comes back,

having conducted whatever.

This is the primary methods finance overseas ventures, right?

If the merchant doesn't return, the risk is on the

creditor side, the merchant does return, you have to pay

back the credit, and he bears the commercial risk, right?

um.

I mean, You wonder how many people just, you know,

didn't go back to their home port, right?

I'm not sure if I would offer a sea loan

to somebody who didn't have a family, uh, in the

town that you were supposed to return to.

Um, often any belongings and security, uh, and you know

the penalties are high, you have to pay double the

amount back if you don't, if you return and don't

pay back immediately, uh, they, they basically sometimes you have

to bring your wife in, maybe calling the wife collateral

is a bit extreme, but you know, you can see

uh what the idea is here, um, now.

Other kinds of venture based, well, things you would call

businesses or proto businesses.

The commenda is the best example of this, right?

Um, this doesn't come only of Italy.

You see versions of it in the Islamic world, uh,

and it predates the commenda, uh, but becomes important, you

know, also in Italy, so you get these.

Um, financial instruments.

Remember that, you know, the Mediterranean basin starts off as

the centre of commerce, right?

So you would expect all of these instruments to be

popular there, um, but it's also documented in the Baltics

of spreads pretty quickly.

Dollar formal business partnerships in the Mediterranean world, if not

Europe, right, used for both C trade and Latin trade.

I'm gonna zoom over this.

Um, but you can return to it, uh, if you're

interested for essay, but they take two forms active commando

or passive commander, right?

Active is when two merchants join for a business venture,

um, somebody invests capital, somebody else, the other partner invest

their labour.

One of them goes on a journey, um, and the

other one stays home.

This little piggy went to market.

Uh, did anybody else like think that the pig was

like going to market like to go shopping?

Like when I, I actually only realised this maybe 6

months ago when I was singing to my daughter that's

like, oh, the vegetarian is a bit grim, right?

Pig's not going shopping anyway, um, but so this one

guy goes to the market, the other guy stays home,

receives the goods, sells them, and then they divide up

the profits, right?

The positive one is kind of like venture capital, I

guess, uh, only capital investment isn't involved in the transaction,

right?

It basically is a form of financing trade.

Um, Other things, you know, arriving out of the same

same parts of the world, same period are share ventures.

This is familiar people are just pooling their assets, their

capital, uh, right, this is usually big long voyage wholesale,

you know, trade in high value goods, um.

Right, uh, and this creates new possibilities again for risk

diversification, risk distribution.

This is more Greg's world than mine, um, but you

know, shares are more liquid than actually having to hold

the capital goods, uh, you can trade your share in

a ship at any point, right?

You've invested in a ship, it's gone, you know, maybe

you trade it for something else or cash in your

investment to be short of money before the.

Uh, ship has come back.

Um, there isn't so much of a formal secondary market

in the period, but it does exist to some degree.

So how does this like map on to what we

might start to I call a firm, right?

Well, You start off as family organisation.

Right, so I mean, does all business take, uh, you

know, have a family firm as an antecedent?

I'm not sure, but it's probably likely.

Right, um.

And what they do is they it's another repeated game

we agree on a company name usually it's the name

of the family they do business in the name of

the company, but I think the important thing here is

they're collectively liable, right, the pooling of risk, uh, and

they also like to agree to be traders, right?

They're only they're agreeing to only do business in the

name of the firm, not to do side deals on

their own, um.

Uh, whereas merchants write typically two names, you know, 11

person show and they're personally liable rather than collectively.

Um, and there's all sorts of different things you could

really, really, you know, get your teeth into the literature

about this.

There's all sorts of examples about, uh, structures of companies,

how many people were involved, etc.

etc.

I have a lot of appendix slides which you can

look at later to show some examples of these, uh.

Right?

Um, now, If people want to invest elsewhere, right then.

They have to receive a cent from their partners uh

and and sometimes they actually have hierarchies of rights, OK,

uh, and you also see, uh, these companies attracting outside

investment for kind of passive memberships, um.

With extended business loans, right?

So, what does this do for commerce?

Uh, people argue that it The existence of these components

lubricate the flow of information, right?

Uh, these are the first ones to do.

Double entry bookkeeping, which is an accounting, uh, innovation, um.

They kind of like guilds provide a little bit of

business education and the environment, learning on the job, uh.

And because these firms have long average lifetimes, much like

guilds, they're accumulating knowledge, you know, they're accumulating the human

capital.

It's just instead of, you know, leatherworking or silver.

Silver working, silversmithing, it's about business, right?

Um, and they actually become, uh, widespread some of these,

they become multinational.

Uh, they call them factories in a time, but you

end up with overseas branches, uh, and they end up

being involved, eventually, you know, not only with trade but

also with the production of goods and banking, right?

So you know, maybe there's some kind of monopoly like

behaviour here.

Um, cruising company is the one I, uh, I've chosen

as an example you can find all sorts of information

in my appendix to these slides, uh, but it starts

off in the late 13th century with only family members.

They lend money, they trade grain, right?

Then they grow in that second stage we talked about

by the very end of the 13th century, they admit

some, uh, non-family members, um, but they add, uh, additional.

Uh, what would you call it, you know, business endeavours,

but dealing in oil and wine and wool and textiles,

uh, and in the 14th century, they really take off,

uh, but they collapsed by the middle of the 15th

century, um.

Often never a good idea to do business with England

at this point in time.

I imagine there were some unpaid loans to, uh, English

monarchs, um, also a trade embargo, uh, with England that

really disrupts the world trade, uh, and you know they

lose control of their head office in Florence, right?

But you can see how widespread multinational, uh, the company

gets by, uh, the middle of the 14th century.

OK, so that's what we talked about now we wanna

talk about early modern business environment.

So the most important thing to remember here is in

the early modern world we're starting to expand beyond Europe,

right?

Uh, this is when Europeans discover, uh, the new world

they become very interested in.

Uh, establishing colonies, you know, sometimes settling, other times extracting,

um, but all of these main European countries acquire colonies,

you know, uh, around the world, um, and then you

get the involvement, direct involvement of states because this is

also the period when states start to emerge, right?

So you get large trade ventures, uh, either organised by

or financially supported by European states.

Right?

Now, this doesn't mean that they become entirely outward looking,

because an intensification of trade within Europe happens at the

same time, um.

But this is also the period that within Europe, the

centre of commerce as with, you know, the economy overall

is increasingly moving north west to that kind of North

Sea area, England, Netherlands, etc.

etc.

um, now despite the fact that spatially.

You know you're starting to see Europe uh established bases

all over the world uh trade links are getting longer

and longer and longer uh colonial trade is still only

a fraction of most of the commerce or business that

Europeans engage in, right?

um, but for business it's really interesting I mean there's

a number of different reasons to study this period some

of them we've already discussed, uh, in terms of.

Of course labour and things like that, but you get

the joint stock company emerging for the first time you

get stock markets emerging for the first time, uh, and

all of these things are traced back to colonial trade,

right?

Um, and it's also the rise of like the so-called

fiscal military state, right, uh, where you get states, uh,

companies and.

Uh, you know, the states engaged in commerce, they're engaged

in war.

We'll talk about that vis a vis mercantilism next week.

Uh, they need to pay for their war, so they

start taxing.

So it's all kind of.

You know, merges into one lane in the early modern

period, right?

So you start to see how uh these trading companies

sponsored by the states go back and forth between the

colonies that they established on all sides of the world,

um.

Still very dangerous, very capital intensive, very competitive between the

states.

You get this so called like jealousy of trade doctrine.

This we'll talk about next week, um, but states are

having this idea that I want a positive trade balance,

right?

I should be selling more than I'm buying, uh, you

know, if I'm a positive balance of trade, I'm winning,

right?

What does it sound like?

Sounds like Donald Trump's economic policy, uh.

So, but how, how do you overcome all of these

problems?

Because many of the problems that we talked about for

the mediaeval period, right?

Despite all of these instruments and organisations and institutions, they

still exist, especially when the distances grow, you still have

problems of trust, you still have ships that sink, you

still have pirates, um, you know, now you have other

states competing with you as well, state sponsored pirates, so

there's lots of barriers to entry.

Again, we need to find ways to overcome these problems

and this typically involves.

Sharing risks, pooling resources, right?

That's if you look at all of these instruments and

forms of organisation and I mean we talked about profit

orientation maybe being the thing that defines business from other

types of economic activity, um, maybe pooling resources, sharing risk

is, you know, is that something that's unique to business?

I don't know, but it's another aspect of it.

Um, So Here is where you get the famous East

India companies, right?

They emerged first in, uh, the Netherlands and then in

England with uh the VOC, the Dutch East India Company,

and the English East India Company, right?

They allow many investors to pool their assets into one

company.

Um, it has obviously its origins and these previous, you

know, iterations of companion and things like that that we

talked about, um, but there's a number of developments that

businessorians argue to be advantageous, right?

Um, the first thing is that the investors, unlike the

companion we talked about, whether they're active or passive, are

no longer involved on a day to day basis.

They still have a voice, but somebody else does the

day to day operations of the company, right?

I mean, that sounds a lot uh like modern shareholding,

right?

I own shares in.

You know, whatever company, uh, I notionally have a vote,

you know, um, but I don't get to, you know,

tell the CEO what to do on a day to

day basis.

Um, returns or investment aren't guaranteed, but they are based

on profit and loss.

Uh, interestingly, with a joint stock company.

Quite a commitment because you can't withdraw your investment unless

the company withdraws.

So that, that is, you know, even though the fact

it's supposed to be a risk pooling endeavour, uh, that

sounds quite risky, um.

But that's where you get uh the rise of secondary

markets to facilitate this because you can't sell them to

somebody else, right?

So you get the stock market that rises uh as

a way to trade investments in these joint stock companies.

So you have the shareholders at the bottom, uh, and

then they feed their way up in this kind of

vertical vertical uh orientation.

Right.

Um, now, it's actually debated in the literature with the

origins of these companies are.

For our purposes, it doesn't really matter.

Uh, somebody will say that it, you know, takes it,

uh.

The main idea from ventures in late mediaeval England, others

see it coming from Italy.

I don't think it really matters because uh you.

Clearly get the most.

Uh, cogent articulation of these principles in the Dutch East

India Company and the English East India Company, right, uh,

the English example it it comes from this company of

the staple, uh, where the king, so you're starting to

see the states involved even though it's kind of before

states exist to the degree that we, uh.

Before we can call a mistake, but anyway, grants monopoly

rights.

So you have the exclusive licence to do whatever kind

of trade, uh, in this case, well, right?

And not much after that, um.

You get other companies exporting wool to the Netherlands.

Some people say this comes from here, uh, but really

there's a lot of antecedents you could point to.

Uh, there's, uh, Muscovy Company as well, um, and this

is the first regulated company that's created exclusively for long

distance trade, right, uh, founded by 200 London merchants, um.

And they invest 6000 pounds just to tell you how,

you know, risky it was.

Three ships leave London, only one returns.

They originally want to go to, uh, India, which everybody

does at this point, but where they end up, uh,

is in Russia anyway, so this is another precursor to

this joint stock.

And you can see uh how Finding a passage So,

uh, there's all sorts of, you know, advantages, people will

argue, uh, right.

The biggest one maybe is that shareholders only have limited

liability, right?

Um.

Because it's impossible to hold a lot of investors liable

for all of the wealth, um, and nobody wants to

invest small amounts of money if you have to take

on a lot of liability, uh, so this is probably

the origins of the limited liability company which obviously is

a big.

Uh, aspect of company organisation right to this day, um,

then you contrast this is what we talked about previously

where shareholders were collectively liable without any limit, uh, and

passive shareholders had no rights, so it's no longer a

kind of opt in opt out dichotomy.

The joint stock company provides you with many more options,

um.

The joint stock company is also independent in legal terms,

uh, so it doesn't depend on whether one person lives

or dies.

Uh, and as we said before, the shares are increasingly,

uh, increasingly tradable, um.

And to contrast that with the or right if one

of your partners dies, the whole operation ceases, which obviously

isn't very convenient, especially in a period of particularly high

mortality.

Another big difference here is show aren't tradable, so you

can see how, you know, it's an advantage over previous,

uh, forms of business organisation, right?

There's still lots of risks, right?

There's still, uh, virtual agent problems, um.

Long distance trade is still very dangerous in this period,

uh, and you know tying all of your, you know,

things to, uh, often enigmatic rulers of European states brings

political risks as well, um, so.

There's lots more information that you can go to in

the appendix here uh that talks about the English East

India Company specifically and then the Dutch East India Company,

um, but at that point, uh, I'll leave it to

you to investigate and I'll leave you until next week.

Thank you.

Where did I get 60, OK.

Mhm Thank you everyone.

What was I doing?

No.

You had me afterwards and he was like.

It's next year, right, at a private number.

Oh climb up.

Lecture 13:

This is the right one.

This It's a long one.

We just got to try to figure out how to

get this projector working.

No.

Well, This is annoying.

Yes That's working.

I've already tried the power button and that one.

where the phone is Oh So All right.

Hi there.

Uh, this is, uh, Jordan Clark calling.

I'm in the lecture theatre on the ground floor of

the building, and I can't seem to get the projectors

to turn off.

Yes.

Thank you a lot of things We should get here

soon, I guess, but.

Yeah You they don't click OK.

OK I try to kill a bit of time until

they get here.

Wait for the song to finish.

I'm not sure if this song even has a time

signature.

Yeah.

now 2 people.

who So would would you.

What genre of music is this?

Oh, it's probably filed under electronic.

I'm glad to see it transcends generations.

Uh.

Um.

Alright, everyone, uh.

How how we doing, uh, first thing, uh, apologies for

last week, uh, for.

Change call an audible and change at short notice.

I thought it was very.

She's better now, uh, so everybody can breathe a sigh

of relief.

We're back here in, in real life.

Um, this, uh, week, um, as soon as we get

the projectors to turn on, which our colleagues from IT

are going to come.

Hey how's it going?

Well that's I'm just gonna shut the system off.

OK, turn it on again.

These ones are working, interestingly, so the screens are working,

yeah, you're just gonna have to go lecture from over

there.

Yeah, fingers crossed.

Doesn't help anybody in the first two rows, they just

turning on.

OK, so in the future I just need to restart

it, basically.

OK.

Yeah, OK, sorry, many, many thanks for your help then.

I should have I should have thought of that.

Just before you go, let's.

Yeah.

Ah, there we go.

Thank you so much.

All right, everyone, we're, we're we're good.

Uh, so this is, uh, often, uh.

My, my favourite part of.

Uh, where I sit aside and um.

Uh, give one of my colleagues, um, the opportunity to

lecture to you.

So this is Greg, who at least half of you

know very well, uh, by this point, um, so Greg

is going to give the lecture today, uh, and I

gave Greg like the full, full choice of which session

he wanted to lecture.

Not choose the easy one, so he has challenged himself,

uh, here today to challenge you.

So I'll turn it over to Greg to, uh, talk

about, um, well, A, the song of the week, and

then B, which, uh, I've been told by another one

of our colleagues that I should have known about but

did not, um, so I'll turn it over to you.

Well, in case you missed it, the only justification was

that the title, it's called Big Science, which is where

we're heading with with the.

Laurie Anderson from, when do you think about 1980 or

something, quite a long time.

Quite, quite a while back, anyway, um.

Those are the three areas that I'm going to cover,

and by the end of the session, if I've done

it right.

I might have left you convinced by technological determinism.

Or not, as the case may be, so maybe Marx

is right.

Even Work our way through to that.

As, as we often do, I'm going to start with,

with not just one but two pictures this week.

First, firstly to um.

Give you kind of health warning.

Knowledge is a dangerous thing, as we say, a little

knowledge is an even more dangerous thing.

And here's what happened to Prometheus who He was foolish

enough to give knowledge of fire to humans and then

punished by his fellow gods to have his liver pecked

out by an eagle, well chained to a rock, and

this is an event this is an even better one,

this is, there's more folk wisdom here.

God had meant us to fly, he was in the

wing.

to any bright spark building the first lighter that breaks

his neck.

Um, you can see why this has to be here

because it's also got.

The Icarus is the small detail in the bottom right

hand corner, but if you look at the landscape, he's

managed to fly all the way from Crete to Belgium

or wherever that is, uh.

Where he had been put in jail for revealing knowledge

again, this time it was the knowledge of the labyrinth,

I think, so.

Just be warned, knowledge is dangerous and um faces some

headwinds in popular culture.

So the big, the big questions, not all to be

answered today, but maybe we can sneak up on some

of them.

First one's a kind of easy one.

It's historical narrative roughly what happened.

12 hour period.

And Why does it appear that Technological inventiveness is different

in different places at different times.

And at the end, more specifically, how did it come

about?

By 1750, Europe was the most technologically advanced.

Region and more specifically England where the industrial revolution kicked

off.

Um Like I say, we're not actually going to specifically

set out to answer all those questions, but certainly equip

you to approach some of them by going through what

do we mean by knowledge, what is knowledge?

How is it?

Created, how do we add to the store of knowledge?

How is it spread, disseminated, um.

Through education and such like.

What's the relationship between knowledge and technology?

And how do either or both of them.

Relate to or drive economic growth.

Here, this is the one slide version of the whole

thing.

This is the this is the TikTok thumbnail.

one's like, just remember, remember this and you'll be done.

We're going to talk about epistemology, and I know some

of you because I've spoken to them, have have studied

philosophy before, so that wouldn't be a surprise to you.

It's the philosophy of knowledge.

What do we know?

How do we know it and how, how, how do

we think we come to know it?

And we're going from the, the, the mediaeval, uh, the

scholastics, more to come on them later.

In in which in which period.

Knowledge was essentially a deductive and very much a logic

based process.

Later on With the incoming scientific revolution, it becomes inductive

and evidence based.

The technology starts with the mediaeval stuff, water mills and

windmills and ploughs that come across before.

And at the end of the period, some, some of

the industrial revolution, the water frame and steam engine in

the middle, the one of the candidates for the most

transformative technology.

B It can be disputed, but it would be, it

would be in everyone's top 5 probably.

Uh, and the names to go with those, Thomas Aquinas

and a particular favourite by William of Ockham.

He, he of, of, of the razor, which is still

a, a, a really useful principle to employ today.

Gutenberg was printing obviously Newton Copernicus with the scientific revolution.

And these industrial link.

OK, that's where we're heading, that's the one, the one

slide view.

Um, start with a discussion of what is knowledge and

how it's created.

One of the big names in in this field of

economic history, Joe and some of his stuff is on

your reading list.

Starts with This quite this two quite distinct forms of

knowledge, propositional knowledge and prescriptive knowledge.

Propositional knowledge is largely about knowing the answer to what?

What is this?

Uh, to the Greeks, that's epistemic.

Prescriptive knowledge is how to do stuff, how to make

things, how to build things, the technique.

And these, these bodies of knowledge are Incremented through discoveries,

inventions and innovations.

It's worth just just a second to describe.

The discovery is I like the word says, it's a

discovery.

It's finding something.

An invention is a new.

Large scale, a new, a new bit of kit to

do something and innovation.

it's not completely consistent the way the words are used,

but an innovation you can think of as a, a

smaller scale, a micro invention, how to do something just

a little bit better.

Both of them wrapped together in the one concept, innovation.

So if you talk about an innovative society, it's about

inventions and innovations.

I'm going to talk about how they.

If they do drive productivity.

Propositional knowledge that left hand box is Largely analytical, and

it can be codified and written down.

It's about.

unpack the concept of a dog and unpack the concept

of a mammal, and you can deductively show that the

dog is a man, and it's the logical certainty that

they're looking.

And it can be written down.

Prescriptive knowledge on the other hand, is the sort of

thing that you came across.

The discussion with guilds last term.

It's not so easily written down.

It's largely passed on by Face to face education.

And the test there is not logic, it's just, does

it work?

You tell me this makes bread, well, does it?

Does it make better bread than the other guy's bread?

If so, we'll switch to using that method rather.

There's a very pragmatic test.

Um, And for for most of history.

A lot of the additions to Techne were the result

of.

Almost random trial and error processes.

Oh gosh, you've just made beer.

Or in some cases Really does look more like an

accidental.

Some of the Maybe Recipe.

Techniques for tanning It's so convoluted and foul smelling.

You see why they vanished to the outskirts of town,

but equally.

You, you, you could not imagine that anybody set out

to design those processes.

You might have observed the outcome of a series of

accidents.

So in, in, in this, in this world.

Additions to knowledge, innovation are largely to do simply with

how many people there are, because it's, it's not, it's

not a structured process.

I just need to insert here one very quick as

a cycling qualification.

Joel Mock here and and the rest of this, the

rest of this session is about what he calls useful

knowledge, which kind of pushes the definition one step further

away.

Being A natural phenomena in order to do something.

So necessarily that misses out an awful lot of what

you would ordinarily regard as knowledge.

So anything to do with.

Society, human behaviour, so for instance.

Valuable, obviously linked to productivity and Very important, but not

this week.

Onto human capital for a moment, um.

Where and where and how is I Is it, guess

what putting putting M's word.

Is it what the brightest and the best get up

to?

Or is it, is it important to have high levels

of human capital in the general population?

Pause for thought.

Either way, it it's difficult to quantify.

Some things you can measure, you can count, you can

count the number of university graduates.

You can count books and and how many books and.

You've seen something of how craft skills were passed were

passed on and how important.

Guild system Another candidate for measurement which I used is

is still here.

Years of education in general literacy.

The UN Human Development Index takes as an input.

Years of education.

For the high end human capital.

Here's a list of universities and when they were founded

and.

First off, note how few there were.

So if you think the product of the university made

a difference.

You have to think how many people are.

Engaged And a lot of the foundations actually are driven

out of.

Religious, So the Sorbonne in Paris is is where it

is because it was outside the reach of the bishop

of Paris.

Cambridge is where it is because they had a dispute

with the people at Oxford and wandered off to found

Cambridge instead.

What did they teach at those universities, and this is

where you come back to the The way of thinking

and the way the way the curriculum is structured and

then.

In a moment, think well, how does how does that

play into the economy?

The predominant way of thinking, as I said in the

overview slide.

Derived from the which they recovered thanks to contact with

the Arabs.

And the curriculum had As it Three first prongs grammar,

logic, and rhetoric.

Which was to do with ideas and the proof of

ideas and logic and the communication and rhetoric, and then

something about numbers and arithmetic and geometry and so on

leading to a speciality.

theology.

which we At least in one of these studies have

some, some at least correlation evidence linking it to.

Economic progress.

What was valuable, and you could see from the disciplines

that they were studying is the application of the analytical

skills.

And then logic And applying a legal framework in trade

and commerce.

As you would have seen a couple of weeks ago,

for example, in the bill of exchange, this needs to

be written up and it needs to be documented.

And dyslexia and and um.

From my own Field of study and something that Jordan

and I were hearing a lot about yesterday afternoon.

Some of them became accountants or auditors working on the

large minorial of estates, writing down the accounts, what it,

how much has been bought and sold.

much was left in stock.

And there's This study by Canton and Newman, based on

the enrollments.

So this is the number of students enrolled in Germany.

Linking that to the growth of urban populations and the

number of marketing.

So what looks like an unpromising curriculum, and that's where

our word trivial comes from, the trivium, the three of

grammar, logic and rhetoric is exactly the origin of trivial,

but.

It does have some value, some economic value.

When you apply their skills.

Again, looking at the high end, you can uh look

at the numbers of books produced and years of education

and general literacy.

It's a log scale on the on the left, so

the increases are even more dramatic than they look here.

The point that these two authors are making is that

Their their analysis of the numbers of books being Produced

by Turns out to be And a robust and reliable

guide to diverge to economic growth within Europe and also

divergent.

economic growth of Europe and divergence within.

So Take No, they shouldn't really have called it the

UK at this point, but take Sweden and the UK

who start out.

That's And then As compared with Spain.

Starts out near the bottom and remains near the bottom.

This is what, this is the evidence that they're presenting

that.

Book production And economic growth Tell the same story.

Looking broader slightly broader than the high end.

The average years of education.

Over a large part of the period, as you can

see from this, it was.

Not much of an increase in the average years of

education, although, as we all averages.

It will turn out that this important variation concealed within

that and there will be places that are significantly above

average, but also note that.

The industrial revolution when it when it starts in the

mid 1700s.

Leads to actually a decline in Average education, you can

imagine the disruption of moving a large part of the

population from the countryside into the towns.

But then about 100 years later with the industrial revolution

in full swing.

The average years of education is.

On a steeply upward trend.

Matching that is um a chart of.

It's actually illiteracy, isn't it?

It says literacy in England, but it's actually estimated illiteracy.

So we, we, we start out.

In the 1500 with more or less everybody illiterate, and

again there's a, there's a gradual improvement over a couple

of 100 years, and then some noise around the time

of the industrial revolution before there's a steep fall off

the period afterwards when literacy is becoming more important.

So clearly it wasn't that important to the onset of

the industrial revolution, at least not in an average fashion,

but afterwards became so.

Um Very briefly, because you did a lot of this

last term, the craft skills were largely passed on face

to face, right?

Guild masters training their apprentices and apprentices having to take

a Journeymanship The other the other version of that was

bringing a master builder from somewhere which was good at

something, so a French cathedral builder coming to England helping

help build a cathedral here.

And just to reiterate over the whole period.

Joel Mokia.

This is very strong on this.

Although there were a few headline items that make the

news and are still regarded as important today, there was

an awful lot of small scale technical change going on.

Doesn't make the front pages of the newspapers quite the

same way.

Towards the end of the period that we Scientific revolution

becomes increasingly important.

Bringing an entirely different flavour.

For the scholastics, you really could not trust the evidence

of your senses that you were likely to be deceived.

And you all um.

Like, uh, like Plato's allegory of the cave, you were

sitting in a dark place looking at shadows, you couldn't

trust your senses.

Come the scientific revolution, absolutely you could, and you were

taking, taking notes of what you saw.

An apple dropping off a tree.

Observations And drawing And drawing up mathematical models to describe

that.

So Newton's book is the mathematical principles of natural philosophy,

the application of mathematics.

Natural philosophy And it does not, it doesn't.

It did not at all conflict with being As being

a religious believer.

What the object of the project.

Discover What's In the way the universe OK, that was

the world of ideas now into actual technology itself.

Uh, technical progress is about being able to get more,

get more for the same.

So the greater volume of output.

And efficiency saving or maybe just better output.

From the same And Therein lies a measurement challenge.

The first one is relatively easy to do.

The second one, how do you account for?

Changes in quality is much more of a challenge.

As we will see.

Another important contextual point to understand about.

Kind of obvious, but it has a lot of ramifications,

stop to think.

You can only work with with the Endowment of materials

that you have.

At the time that you're you're living and working.

So, um.

Leonardo could draw draw a design for.

But there was no way of making.

The wood and the iron Powering There's If not horses

or So they were designed, but they didn't do anything.

You're in the choice of materials and the way you

can work with it, the way you can measure and

quantify it, and the way you can fix it together.

You're limited to What's available to you at the time

and.

Who It's an expensive business.

There's a.

Whenever anyone Always get a So we'll we'll spend some

money.

Then When we're done, the money will come streaming back

in.

That's the problem I don't believe that I That won't.

But there's there's the finance And somebody to That somebody's

put up the money and someone's I want to take

a punt on your invention.

Uh, a legal framework helps too.

The patent law was reformed in England in 1624.

As you remember from the guilds weekly.

essentially a bribe to be allowed to have a monotony.

As your guild With the patent law in place, it's

designed to put Invention.

Inventor that has come up with That you can profit

from themselves.

There's also hard work Edison's estimate was 1% ideas and

99% hard work, the actual words are on the slide

there.

Uh, and that's just to get the thing built in

the first place, and then in order to use it

productively, in order to, as it were.

Make this You probably need organisational change.

The new management, more money, working capital.

And a different set of skills in your workforce.

And maintenance, because whatever, whatever the, whatever the kit is.

It breaks down So there's more More money, more money

and skills required there too.

Go through In sort of reverse order.

Three examples.

This is And operates water frame.

This is This is taken from Robert Allen's book.

Revolution His, his idea was to have.

Some spindles going at different speeds to separate the From

the The raw cotton on the spoons at the back.

And to get them running at different speeds, you need

gears.

The place where you get gears were clocks.

So this is an advertisement that Bob Allen has got

from From 1771.

Wanted, the word journeyman there, so he's still using journeyman,

which was the, the idea from the guilds.

Clockmakers or others that understands the tooth and pinion well,

he's looking to get the engineering skills.

You can see in the.

Top left, the large gears that regulate the speeds of

these spindles.

Sorry, come to that in a moment.

Gutenberg.

As I said with One of the contenders for the

invention.

Of the millennium Clearly he's famous for being a printer

and a bookseller.

You can tell his story actually in using completely modern

language.

He spotted a gap in the market, books, he set

about devising.

A means of producing books that would meet the requirements

of his target market as in beautifully printed and and

lavishly decorated and illustrated books, Bibles.

He was an entrepreneur.

It was his, it was his um his enterprise.

Plus he burned through all his money.

His backers foreclosed on the loans and took charge of

the company and he became an employee in what had

been his company.

Where did the money go?

Largely, if you'd, if you could interview him now, I

think he'd he'd probably tell you that the printing was

the easy bit.

The difficult bit was metallurgy.

He had to find the right metals for casting the

type that you see on the side there.

That was his specialty.

Again, it's a think think about it for a moment.

They all have to be precisely the same height because

if they aren't, they won't hit the paper at the

same time, and they have to be the same width,

width, height, the same height, or when you lay them

out in the line, they won't be.

In line.

So cast those accurately.

Hundreds of times so that you've got the upper case,

all of the capital letters and the lower case for

the lower case letters.

He was a metallurgist.

As well as a printer.

A slightly cheeky aside to to show you the costs

of the costs of maintenance, um.

This is one of the uh the manners of the

estate of Winchester.

They made 37 pounds and something from selling grain and

malt, but they had to spend.

About 17% of that.

On maintenance of their ploughs and calves, and this is

iron and steel.

And leather and timber and payments to the people who

have those skills.

So you might not want to attach the word commercial

commercialization.

If you can see This Operating as a business today

and accounting for as they're doing here.

These are, these are their accountants drawing up their accounts.

For the costs that they that they've incurred in.

It's like Slow down, pause for a second, you'll take

a slightly different pace.

I just want you to think of the challenge.

One of those flat So the soil What event in

your imagination, the soil where you where you live, you

have to drag something through the soil at a certain

depth.

And it mustn't change too much.

So whatever the depths, maybe it's that that deep.

You have to drag it through the soil, it doesn't

dig in too much and get stuck.

So the rocks start.

It mustn't rise up too much, so it just escapes

along.

It's got to be just below the surface.

And the material you have some wood, and you have

iron.

There is, there is mention of steel, but steel is

very hard to work and it's much more expensive.

And it's going to be pulled by a team of

oxen or possibly horses.

So the challenge for your imagination is how are you

going to construct something?

Oh yeah, and to fix it together, you've got, there

are no screws, you see screws or nuts and bolts.

You're allowed pigs and roads.

Think about it for a moment, that might be a

large part of why it took so long for the

heavy plough to spread across the continent where it did,

but you have to master those design and construction skills.

And transporting the grain afterwards is is a very similar

problem, you can, you can carry it.

A tonne of grain on something, how are you going

to build a cart?

That can that can take that weight.

And again be pulled by oxen.

Um, the rest of this, I'll just briefly.

When you look at the slides afterwards, there's a roughly

a time, a time dimension along the line.

And those things were available roughly in that sequence.

And you need to pick one from each.

So how is it going to be powered?

After all, a machine, a device.

Yeah, Any of these inventions, they are designed to turn

energy into work.

So where's the energy coming from?

Human muscle or cow or ox or horse.

Wind Right onward, I think.

Here's a suggestion, I think it's not complete, it could

do with at least having gears put onto it, um

of of the of the general purpose the the GPTs

that that were available over over the course of history.

And possibly the only contender with Gutenberg would be.

Maybe writing number 5, whoever it was who first realised

that you could turn marks into clay, marks in clay

into words.

That has to be right up there, I think.

Jordan, I've got for you later, not now, but an

aside to that that you might appreciate.

EH We'll get a slightly different perspective.

They're they're.

We'll have to have like a 101102.

Yeah, well, but much from about from about 11 onwards

it comes too late, isn't it?

And I mean, Do we think AI become Is it

already number 25?

Anyway, OK, we have a measurement problem.

You can quite easily measure inputs, but it's uh and

and outputs, but as I said, tracking the significance of

changes in quality is much more of a challenge.

And uh one of, we've come to some economists in

a moment, so I'll I'll pick up on this idea

of.

Uh, accounting for technology as the, the residual, the unexplained

bit.

In just a moment.

Here, here's a neat graphic that, that has all sorts

of problems, but it does convey 11 idea rather well

that the.

Based on some work by William Nordhaus, who who was

trying to compile.

Consumer price indexes GDP.

concluded that It was beyond the, beyond the reach of

any stats agency to take account of something that changed

as dramatically as this.

So Um At least two things have gone wrong.

The, the reference is the light quantity of a 100

watt light bulb.

And I don't think you can any longer buy.

In I The second is that Back then in 1750

BC, they wouldn't have had anywhere near as much light

as.

So, and today we have way, way, way more light.

I be wrong at both ends, but it does, it

does give you some idea of, of the dramatic change

of quality in the provision of light that today's.

Expenditure of effort is equivalent to 1 2nd where it

would have been 3 hours, 50 hours.

And again, borrowing another pieces.

Culture was proto industry worth the candle.

I mean, is he, is he also calculating?

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Which is why it it.

Uh, it, it almost becomes impossible to draw that dot

once you, once you put the 5% factor in there,

yeah, absolutely.

OK, a quick counter through some of your favourite economists.

Adam Smith, I'm sure you know.

Very well.

Um Growth comes from specialisation and trade.

Simon, it's it's innovation that allows you to break out

of the process that has material.

And no longer be made any better.

The point here, the plough was OK.

Still is the thing that eventually got replaced with the

team of horses or the oxen in front with the

tractor.

But that wasn't until the 20th century.

If you looked around and And It was, it was

still ploughs pulled by horses.

Uh Robert Solo's um uh idea that he of the

residual, when you've.

allowed for inputs of Labour and capital The the Productivity,

the TFP.

The explanatory mean country Sean Peter is the Steve Jobs

of Henry Ford.

Don't, don't ask people what they want, they'll tell you

they want to faster horse.

He gives them a Give them what they haven't given,

give them what they don't know that they want yet.

And to, to all of these.

Market size matters and and demographic.

Effects too.

OK, count us through the big questions.

We're going to talk heading now towards the um.

Some countries better at different times.

As I said in in the.

Early part of the period that we're looking at.

Europe was very much behind the curve and the technological

leader was clearly China.

By 1750 by the time the industrial revolution.

Yeah And in some parts of the world, the That

their the period was by then long past.

And some explanations of what's going on here that there's

um.

technology that the idea that nowhere has been very creative

for more than just a short period.

So China World leader up until 15th century.

Great Britain, 19th.

America 20th century still.

To be debated Uh There was a piece in the

FT last weekend by Darren Nashaboglu suggests he was, although

he's an economic historian, he was a sort of in

futurologist.

He was writing economic history as if he was in

about 2035, looking back at the great collapse of 2030.

So I think he, he, he was very much of

the idea that um the American century is passed.

Yeah, certainly fast passing.

And bringing in Explanations for this that that come from

institutions, from culture.

Politics so institutionally.

What's the framework for protecting an investor, uh, an inventor?

From expropriation, how does he realise the benefits of his

hard work?

Culture What actually motivates this um high-end human capital as

Moa calls it, to take a path of being an

entrepreneurial inventor rather than Whatever else, um.

A writer or a musician.

Or bureaucrats, all these other things that might be.

What you Entrepreneurship.

Um Mark Taylor's book uh suggests an answer that combines,

he finds each of those sort of interesting but incomplete

and has an idea of creative insecurity where whereby.

Innovation comes when The innovator finds that External threats to

his position are greater than internal.

It's is security.

If the threat comes more from within.

Then innovation is, is suppressed.

OK, we're doing fine.

Skip past some Chinese technologies and um.

Just to present the idea of the puzzle because the

Um The reading for it is on is in the.

In the course schedule and you'll be reading it for

the classes next week.

So the question is, How did China come to be

so far ahead in In technology And then why was

it not still ahead in the 18th and 19th century?

A flick it another way around.

Why was the industrial revolution in Europe, or more specifically

in England?

Why, why not in China, and why not 400 years

earlier?

I'm not going to reveal what reveal an answer, but

just point you in the direction of that reading for.

Next week Um, actually, the, you know, I will, I

will a bit more.

Um, there's this idea that 14th century China and 18th

century England were similar, but how do you, at what

level do you measure similar?

Joel Mier and and and Bob Allen have uh a

lot, a lot to say about.

The The details, the details, the micro detail of the

of the technical environment that that pertained at the time.

So, could you, Advertise for a clockmaker and get someone

to come and help you with your project.

What was available to you?

Could you, could you find a, a whole repertoire of

skills just just out there already that you can build

from?

OK, I just want to go quickly to the very

last one here.

Those, those that were in my classes, you will have

seen this earlier in the week, for the rest, there's

a seminar later on this afternoon.

Julius Kochnick will be I do the presentation, but just

look at the abstract.

He's talking very much about the things that I was

going mentioning in the part on.

Human capital and technology.

And I think the key thing is There were, there

were areas where.

Average education was, was misleading.

There were areas where some, some.

I haven't seen it yet, so I can't, I can't

speak to the data that he's got, but some towns,

some regions where there were islands of greater education.

And the skills that were available to you in that

area were above average.

And he's also picking up on the ideas.

Yeah Epistay and techne have.

Come much closer together overlapping or in the.

I mean, to be really sort of sloganish about it,

philosophy and theology have joined up with engineering.

By the end of the period that we're looking.

I think I'll leave you with that as the thought,

philosophy and theology meet engineering.

Well, when you uh.

Eventually by Greg and you can see.

Um, he might remember you sign your book.

Uh, please do attend if you're at all interested in

um.

Early modern technology, uh, and we'll see you all next

week.

um When the projector wouldn't boot up, it was going

to be deeply ironic.

vision of Asking you to do this lecture and then

only giving you 20 minutes to do it or something,

uh, because I couldn't get the computers to work.

I did try turning it off and on before that

guy came, but uh.

Yeah You Thank you.

get home at a reasonable hour last night?

I don't know what I must, must have been 9:30

or 10 of course there was no buses when I

got tonnes Park.

Um, yeah, so I always think, you're gonna pop up

for the seminar in the afternoon and have a quick

beer, get home for dinner, it never works out that

way.

It's much more palatable when you can have a nice

beer in the.

Afterwards, uh, that this cold weather really makes it.

Lecture 14:

Go back.

Yes I have Mm.

All right.

Oh, come on, you stupid thing.

Not again, again this week.

I don't know whoever is in here before me.

There we go.

Does something horrible to it.

Assume Chris.

Mm Uh, Nope.

Alright, that's uh, that's a deep cut.

Anybody know this one?

Really?

Oh wow.

Did you see the YouTube before?

OK.

I think you're going to become my musical oracle from

now on.

Uh, that is very, very impressive.

OK.

Uh, did your parents raise you on a steady diet

of the kinks then?

OK, OK.

Uh, so today we want to talk about urbanisation, right?

Um, This, I think, a bit like the lecture on

money, is not like.

Uh, an explanatory model in itself.

It's a stylized fact.

Of the development of pre-industrial economies as is, uh, monetization,

so we need to understand the chronology, right?

And we need to understand uh the effects, right?

So in that way very similar to our discussion on

money, right?

We know urbanisation, uh, happens, um, we want to know

why it happens, why it happens when it does.

And where it does, and we also want to know

its effect.

Um, I think maybe where things diverge from our discussion

on money is that urbanisation is more frequently used as

a proxy for uh economic growth in the absence of

other empirical evidence, right?

So if people don't have data on wages or living

standards or other things that you might use for national

accounting to create GDP, but they do have estimates on

urbanisation.

For reasons we'll soon see, frequently use urbanisation rates as

a proxy for economic growth.

If there's more cities and there's more people in those

cities, we assume the economy is growing, right?

So because it looms so large in the literature as

a as a proxy, um, and it's clearly something that

happened over the course of our period, we want to

understand it, right?

Am I missing any other motivations, Greg?

No.

Good.

Uh, and I'd say that the other thing is that

Depending on who you talk to.

Um, Where do I plug this thing in?

Hopefully it's here.

Uh, you know, there might be uh more or, uh,

greater or lesser.

Emphasis on the urban world, right?

Uh, you're talking to me most of the time.

I'm, you know, a card carrying member of the Agricultural

History Society.

I work on agricultural economies, so I probably er towards

the non-urban sector.

There's other people who might teach this course and talk

primarily about urban worlds, right?

So we need to try to balance those two things,

um, and I think in the main.

The broad narratives of economic history tend to focus on

things that are going on in or near cities, um.

Although we've talked a lot about why the countryside is

important as well, uh, so why should we study urban

history?

That's where we started, um, we wanna talk about how

we define an urban environment because that is not at

all clear, um, and when you encounter.

These estimates of urbanisation in the literature, as you will.

The first thing you have to ask is how is

this person defining urbanisation, especially if they're using it as

a proxy, right?

Um, we'll talk about, you know, what urban development does,

uh, and then we have a case study of London,

uh, which should set the seeds for the weather is

now improving.

I think it's about time for us to plan our,

uh, walk around mediaeval London, so, uh, we'll talk a

little bit about, uh, that.

Now, um, why should we care about urbanisation, right?

So it's part of the classical narrative of economic growth

is moved from agriculture to industry, move from countryside into

towns, right?

Most historians would agree that the urban network of today

was mostly in place by 1500.

There's been very few additions of deletions.

There might be dramatic, uh, differences in the size of

the population living in these places, but spatially, you know,

our urban network is largely the same.

Um, so we're moving from this, right, uh, to this

in the pre-modern.

Um, Now, there's a symbiotic relationship, you know, uh, which

comes from, you know, which is justified by this quote,

that the destiny of towns is bound up with the

fate of the economies in which they lie, right?

And is this kind of thinking that leads to urbanisation

being used as such a, you know, uh, important proxy

in economic history.

Well, what does urbanisation actually mean?

What can we learn from these numbers and is urbanisation,

I should put good in parenthesis here, is it a

good indicator of economic development.

One of the classic.

Exam questions for this topic would be.

Is urbanisation a cause or a consequence of economic development,

right?

Keep that question in the back.

Define an urban environment, town, country, right?

Um, what do you think?

How do we How do we decide what counts as

an urban environment and what doesn't?

Anybody have an idea?

You're a historian and I'm giving you the task of

telling me in 1326, uh, how much of the population

in England was living in urban environments.

What's the first thing you would do?

Anybody?

If you look at the population and Next step, we

need to know where they're living, right through the hand

in the back.

Population density.

OK, good.

So people per square mile, that could be a good

one.

Yeah, that's what we need to do.

We need to figure out there now.

There's some etymology that's important here, right?

So our word country, which we probably used to be

non-urban, uh comes from uh contrata, which means distance from

distant from the court.

Uh, so it's very much, you know, defined by what

it is not, um, so you guys are talking about

this many historians, these demographic thresholds, right?

Urban centres are those with ex-inhabitants, but also they often

use different varying, uh, things, so you know it might

be a town is defined by places where more than

500 people live, a city is where more than 5000

people live, but they're often arbitrary.

Right, so think about that.

uh, if you adjust your threshold, you'll get a different

amount of urbanisation, and if you're using urbanisation as a

proxy, then you'll get a different story and obviously, right,

uh, if your threshold is set at, you know, places

with more than 5000 people that, you know, but the

population is constantly changing because that threshold need to move,

you know, etc.

etc.

Um, so it's very good for comparison.

Here we have Doomsday Book, England, uh, and then the

peak of mediaeval population around 1300.

So you're moving from the number of towns from 120

to about 500.

Now what's important to think about here, what you'll see

in a minute, does this mean that there is 380

new towns popping up?

Or does it just mean that you set the threshold

of an arbitrary number and the number of inhabitants in

places that already existed has grown, that's probably more the

case.

Number of large towns of more than 5000 people has

moved from 4 to 20, uh, and the population of

London.

moving from 18,000 to 70,000.

But perhaps this is too simple, right?

Um, because between, you know, the, you know, high and

late Middle Ages.

There's a number of small towns with populations between 300

and 2000.

They missed the cutoff of uh let's say 5000 or

3000 inhabitants threshold, but they perform almost all of the

same economic functions in the.

They have markets.

They have smithing specialisation, right?

So this demographic explanation or demographic characterization is often a

bit too, uh, arbitrary.

So maybe you want to find a town simply by

its function, right?

Is there industrial activity?

Is there commercial activity?

Is there an administrative centre?

Is there anything cultural?

Is there an urban spirit?

Are there cultural institutions right that we correlate with towns?

Why do people always talk about wanting to live in

large cities, right?

A, it's about jobs, but often it's about culture, right?

Uh, there's more things to do in London than there

are in most other cities in the world.

That's why it's a desirable place to live.

This is the water, by the way, not a beer.

Um, anyway, urban, urban administration.

Is another factor that you might use then, uh, to

characterise the town, is there an administrative centre, right?

So this process of urbanisation can kind of take on

four different definitions behavioural one, a demographic one, an economic

one, an institutional one.

Um, this behavioural definition, which isn't, you know, particularly pervasive

when economic history, but it defines urbanity it kind of

culturally about, you know, again, distinct from the countryside, distinct

from rustic environments, right, urban way of life, etc.

etc.

um.

But small communities, even that might have been commercially active,

might not be thought of as urban, right?

There's debates about the minimum size of a town.

Etc.

etc.

um, and this concept of urbanity, let's forget about demographic

stuff and let's just say if the people there embody

some kind of urban culture then it's a place no

matter how many people are living there, how do you

actually define urbanity and how do you compare it uh

over space over time.

Um, because it's either fixed over space and time or

wholly subjective, right?

So it becomes a bit of circular reason and it

becomes a definition that focuses on modernity.

You're saying, look, I'm Jordan, I'm living in 2025.

I know what happens in the city.

I have to project that definition on to the past,

right?

Um, and that is problematic for history.

So, the meat of our discussion today is going to

be about, you know, what urban development means for the

pre-industrial economy, right?

Uh, so, Basically defined by society's ability to attain a

certain level of subsistence in its environment, right, requires the

capacity for exchange of surrounding countryside, uh, and if not

exchange, it has to command or extract from the countryside,

right?

Therefore, urbanisation is by definition a function of economic development

because for people to exist in a city they cannot

be self-sufficient.

Right, so the economy and trade has to be working

in order for the city to exist in the first

place.

So if the city exists, all those things that we

know are highly correlated with economic growth, trade, specialisation, they

must be happening, right?

People will move to towns if they can, um, and

we just kind of assume that there's no barriers to

movement or supply, uh, in the theoretical sense, although this

isn't the case always in history, right?

Um, specialisation is inherent to urbanisation as well because there

has to be a division of labour through town and

country, right?

So Tony Wrigley, who, you know, was.

Done a lot of work on this, saying a rising

level of real income and a rising proportion of urban

dwellers are likely to be a linked phenomenon in the

pre-industrial economy, right?

So this is a justification for using urbanisation as a

proxy for economic growth, right.

So, this is Smithian Groth, right?

And uh it's articulated uh by some famous historians in

the 1980s like Tony Rigley and John Langton.

Um, so it depends on growing demand, falling transaction costs,

how the towns actually reduce transaction costs and therefore facilitate

trade and specialisation?

Well, because of organising trade, things like guilds that live

in towns do that, uh, information travels to towns and

is exchanged more readily because everybody is in close proximity

to each other.

And often in the pre-industrial world, there's some kind of

legal support for trade, right?

scales, agreed measures, agreed time and place, you know, to

trade.

All of these things we talked about.

You know, rise in markets, uh, in urban centres, this

all reduces transaction costs, right?

So the theory works by saying that food surplus.

And population surplus.

Uh, lead to urban urbanisation leads to specialisation.

specialisation in turn creates a robust manufacturing sector, and manufacturing

leads to greater international trade.

So here you have this.

I should actually read you this in the flow chart,

but basically have a schema that shows how urbanisation is

going to capitalise.

So if all of those things are true, what we

can do is examine the rate of urbanisation as evidence

of a changing proportion of the population employed outside agriculture

because we know that shift has to be happening even

if we don't have precise demographic details, right?

We assume that the more cities that bring up, the

more people must be working in manufacturing and services.

And obviously this involves a migration of individuals um into

towns and cities from agricultural communities.

So as we stated previously, when they grow they need

to be supplied food and fuel, right?

So, uh, you can't escape that relationship and we've talked

about this before, but it's exemplified by London requires, you

know, a million bushes of grain and 100,000 tonnes of

wood every year in the Middle Ages, right?

So without, you know, efficient growth in the countryside, the

city can't grow.

So, just to show how this works, right, we have

long run data between the 18th century and 2010 that

shows, right, on a log scale that GDP per capita

and urbanisation rates.

And, uh, you know, different plots for different centuries, but

basically these two things are correlated, although that correlation, uh,

weakens over time.

Um, so there's basically some stages of narrative of urbanisation,

uh, within Europe, and this is the historical.

The historical timeline, right?

So there's only modest urbanisation between the 14th and the

19th century, but then it really takes off in the

19th century.

However, You know, when you just look at European wide

uh figures it conceals, as averages often do, some real

spatial differences.

So, uh, in East and Central Europe, there's only slow

growth between 1500 and 1800, uh, in itself, uh.

There's a very high level of urbanisation within stagnation, right?

This is these great Italian city states, uh, that urbanised

long before anybody else, um, in, you know, Northern Europe

there's low levels of urbanisation 1300, right, but rapid growth,

you know, as you start to see that little divergence

happen.

So here you have that on the chart.

This is the European average.

This is what we say here look modest growth, uh.

This will be the black death affecting things here, uh,

but between the 15th century and the 19th century, but

then it really takes off, but you see lots of,

uh, differences.

Right?

Now the patterns of European city growth also tell us

quite a bit about changing city characteristics, right?

So the number of cities grows across this period.

Maybe there's 200 European cities and 1200 and 2,0018 that's

an order of magnitude, right?

But most of the growth in urban population, as I

said earlier, was the growth of existing cities rather than

new ones.

So, an average city size grows rapidly in this period

from about 800 people in 1000 to 20,000 people in

1800.

So that's the difference between this intensive and extensive margin

here, right?

So here a plot we see the number of cities,

right?

And that's growing, um, and here we have those two

different definitions, right?

So if we define a city as places that have

more than 2000 people, you see that black line, the

dotted line is a more conservative approach.

It says it's only a city if 5000 people live

there, same trend, uh.

At different levels, but this black line is cities that

grow in size.

The dotted line, the extensive margin is new cities.

So most of this urbanisation rate is driven by increasing

the populations that live in already founded cities, right?

So you see the average city size growing here.

Um, So how do we explain this?

The argues that there's three stages of European urbanisation between

1500 and 1800, right?

Uh, early you get the growth of large cities, uh,

then you have this intermediate period where large cities continue

to grow but small cities stagnate and then the small

cities kind of kick into gear in the third stage,

right?

So growth of large cities in the 16th century is

linked very much to state formation, right?

Um, other cities start to lose independence, become part of

states, uh, in this middle stage, right, you get growth

in large cities, uh, some industrial cities like Lyon, but

they're an exception to the rule, um, and there's losses

in smaller cities, uh, and this is kind of that.

We're putting out a system where a lot of industry

goes actually into the countryside actually leaves urban centres, and

then in the final stage you get this growth of

small cities, um, largely because the state formation process has

kind of, uh, ended, um, capital cities aren't gonna grow

as fast anymore.

And there's also increasing efficiency and commercialization, so small cities

now have an increased role in markets for agricultural goods,

um, and early industrialization drives small city growth from this

latter stages.

So why the cities emerge?

What's the economic theory, right?

Um, urban economists, urban economists.

Focus on two main regions, right?

A, there's natural advantages.

Some site has a specific physical characteristic that encourages individuals

to to settle there.

What might that characteristic be?

I mean, you, what's the natural advantage that some location

might have that would uh be attractive for, you know,

starting a city, yeah.

Rivers, right, we want access to water, right?

Most cities.

In all cities, I'm trying to think of it as

an exception, Greg, if you know any, please put your

hand up, uh, but.

Yeah, that's gonna be a big one.

What else?

River is one thing.

What does the river do?

Why do you want to sit next facilitates trade and

so.

Right Yeah, and maybe secondarily access to water.

Yeah, the, uh, if you're on a river basin, then

the agricultural land around that area might be good that's

gonna be really important to me.

1 or 2 slides, so hold that thought.

Anything else?

What are, what are the things, you know, if you're

if you're gonna like have a place where a lot

of people live and you're gonna do a lot of

important stuff.

Yeah, we can think about that.

I mean, that's important for any settlement, but yeah, if

you have a lot of people, then you might want

to think about that.

What else though?

You might want some kind of protection or capacity for

protection if you're going to be doing a lot of

people are going to be living there, you're going to

be generating a lot of wealth, maybe you don't want

to be attacked, so places that offer some kind of

protection for that environmental effects, right, good climate is going

to hell.

Natural harbour is often a big one if you're wanting

to grow into a bigger important city.

And am I missing anything?

No.

Yeah, the characteristics, OK.

The second factor is this agglomeration effect, right?

Individuals choose to co-locate with other individuals for for uh

a mutual advantage, right?

And this creates an inertia or a gravity for cities,

right?

You get agglomeration effects.

Um, so this is kind of second-order geography, uh, whereas

the first one is kind of first-order geography.

You know, if you, you can, you know, well, it's

really easily is illustrated with modern day London, right, uh,

you know, maybe you work in London and live in

London and you choose to stay there because you also

like going to the theatre which also happens to be

in London, etc.

etc.

and that is the agglomeration effect, right?

Yeah, economic agents cluster in places where they have access

to natural advantages.

What do we talk about?

Yeah, agricultural hinterland.

Excellent point.

Uh, water transport, excellent point.

Hilltop, I think that was my point, easily defendable.

Great, um, and all of these are prerequisites for city

growth, right?

Uh, places that don't have these, um, don't tend to

last as long.

Um, and I mean there's a model for this from

another 19th century thinker, uh, we can use in London

as an example.

Expanding and expanding London market, you know, changes the language

specialisation and organisation of agricultural production, so you're talking about

rivers creating, uh, um.

A Uh, productive agricultural hinterland, right?

Uh, von Tunen talks about this.

Now, the one thing about von Ten's model is that

he assumed you had to transport.

You assumed that Which complicates things, but because if you

have a town, you're going to locate nearest the town,

those things that are perishable, uh, and easily shipped.

Further circles from town or the things that are bulkier,

uh, relative to value, uh, and harder to shift, so

you can see that you get a city and the

area around it that is going to um support that

town organises itself uh relative to this.

Uh, so this is that isolated state model.

Interesting story about this.

This is like a.

19th century book, um.

Home university Florida, they actually had like.

edition copy of it that was just on the shelf,

and because, you know, a bit.

Really excited and I took this book out, um.

Night I left my backpack on the kitchen chair, uh.

My dog was inside My dog that had never shown

any interest in books before.

While I was away, I pulled my backpack down, pulled

all the books out, and chose to destroy.

This irreplaceable 19th century uh issue of isolated state, uh,

which still like I think lives in fragments in a

box in my.

So if you're ever in Alberta looking for this book,

I'm sorry, it's my fault.

Um.

So agglomeration effects is people clustering not because of geography,

uh, but because there's advantages, right?

You have access to suppliers, access to customers, reduces transaction

costs.

Access to skilled labourers, why do the labourers want to

be there?

Well, A, because there's jobs because there's other people doing

things that they like to do.

And also access to knowledge, right?

Knowledge linkages and knowledge spillovers are very important.

We talked about this already.

And this further catalyses specialisation.

So why the cities promote economic growth, right?

This is difficult to unpick, right?

You might increase the productivity of workers.

With better markets and knowledge spillovers, right, um, we didn't

discuss this last week we discussed it earlier this term,

uh, there might be also sociological changes, right?

Maybe people start to live in cities have a more

rational way of thinking, um, break down customary practises, encourage,

right, da da da da da, all of this stuff

is kind of getting at this, you know, definition.

behavioural definition of urbanity, right?

And it's part of the agglomeration thing in a lot

of ways people, uh, in cities tend to be interested

in similar things, uh, relative to people, um, uh, who

reside outside the cities.

And it's not simply an economic phenomenon it's a social

and cultural one as well, um, but when we get

to cities we also get, uh, you know, another way

to focus on political institutional social changes as we're talking

about that arise with um large socially complex.

Settlements, right, so you might also see characteristically, right, the

growth of centralised political and judicial authority, right?

We're living in the pre-industrial world where there is no

atheism, so obviously religious and important religious services, uh, need

to be important.

So I did my PhD in Norwich.

Has anybody been to Norwich?

Hands up if you've been to Norwich, I mean, if

you weren't doing a PhD there or.

Might not have any reason to go.

Nobody's been.

So it's 2 hours away on the train.

And like it's a fantastic, you know, weekend, uh, perhaps

the best example of 11th century secular architecture in all

of Western Europe, smack in the middle of the city.

Probably don't need to spend more than one night there,

but anyway, um, back in the Middle Ages outside of

London, Norwich was the second most important city, um, and

that is not something that, uh, native Norwegians have forgotten

and a lot has changed in the last, uh, 600

years or so, but anyway, uh, the point is there's

a saying that.

There is in mediaeval Norwich, there was a pub for

every day of the week.

A different part for every day of the week and

a different church for every Sunday.

So with this point here you have more than 52

uh churches in mediaeval Norwich providing uh religious services to

a large population, right?

Norwich also has city walls, um, but I don't, they

were more of a symbol of urban prosperity.

uh, I don't think anybody ever attacked Norwich, um.

But all of these other things become characteristics.

Uh, not all of these things are going to, you

know, correlate with every settlement, but certainly a.

Um, OK, we already talked about that.

Uh, now, we might kind of contrast this European narrative

of urbanisation, what happened elsewhere in the world, right?

Uh, urbanisation plays a huge role in European, uh, economic

history.

Uh, it does not play as big of a story

in the research on the development of the Chinese economy,

right?

Um, often a proxy for economic development in the European

context, but it's not really, uh, in China in the

great divergence, right, um.

As we said, why does urbanisation get used as a

proxy, right?

Because it reflects growth and it reflects the ability of

the hinterland to supply a new population centre.

So in your case of the correlation, the urbanisation and

economic growth is quite strong.

Um, it's a different story in China, right?

Coastal cities play a smaller role than they did in

Europe.

Um, cities are actually spread relatively equally around the empire,

so there isn't so much of a tendency to be

located near the sea.

Um, this is a pattern that extends beyond China to

a lot of Southeast Asia.

Um, and this is a very different situation to what

happens in Europe, right?

Europe had a long term rise of urbanisation and rise

of very large cities, so is this some kind of

sign of better economic integration in Europe, right?

Um, that's a kind of open question, um, it's a

fundamentally different political environment in China as well with a

really cohesive empire that probably has more agency in determining

uh how different settlements grow.

Um, now, all of this stuff that we've talked about

in the historical narrative.

Is right with methodological issues, right?

We've talked about the problems with setting arbitrary demographic thresholds

we define cities with non-cities.

We talked about the problem with kind of the circular

and subjective reasoning of giving a behavioural definition about a

city is defined by people doing city things, right?

um.

So the questions you need to ask if you're reading

something about urbanisation or something that uses urbanisation data as

a part of the story is basically how this growth

is measured, how, you know, what growth actually means, right?

There's a lot of different ways to measure growth.

Is it normative number of people living in these cities?

Is it a growth rate, etc.

etc.

Is it density, population density?

That's another one.

Sometimes with the time horizon can really influence the narrative

you see.

Uh, also, if you're trying to measure a city or

a town against itself.

Right, you're only showing the population growth of one place,

but of course you don't know what's happening to the

rest of the uh area that's either sending or gaining

population, right?

So our towns measured relative to themselves or they measured

against other places or are they measured as a share

of national income and national wealth all of these things

you need to think about with urbanisation because it's such

a pervasive proxy, but it can be pulled in so

many different ways.

Right.

Because actually of the growth in share of areas population

that lives in towns actually might be evidence of a

rural recession rather than any kind of urban achievement, right?

So this kind of boils down to is growth in

urbanisation due to push back.

Or pull factor, right?

Are people being pulled into the city by economic gravity.

That's kind of what uh Agglomeration would suggest happens or

are they being pushed into the city because things in

the countryside are stagnating, right?

So we talked about enclosure in England, right?

See a big growth in urbanisation and people living in

towns, uh, after enclosure happens in England.

What is enclosure?

Remember that's when, uh, either Lords or the state between

the 15th and kind of 18th centuries restrict or eliminate

access to common land that many people have been depending

on for at least part of their income.

All of a sudden living in the country isn't viable,

so you have to move to the city, right?

is that.

You know, only because of the economic gravity or the

pull, right?

Do people want to leave their farm and go live

in Chichester or whatever or were they pushed there, right?

That's an important question to consider.

Also, if towns fail to grow, You know when you

measure them by the proportion of local population that might

just be because things are going well in the countryside

doesn't necessarily mean that things are going bad in the

city if people, you know, if the population doesn't grow

right again push or pull hard.

So, try to end this a bit.

We're talking about how London looks, right?

Uh, so this is London in 1086.

Uh, to orient ourselves as a bit, um, Saint Paul's

right.

Uh, 18, 1086, right, um, population estimates vary obviously, so

by 1300, it's probably about the peak of the mediaeval

period before the Black Death reduces population, 70,000, but maybe

as low as 50 or as high as 100, right?

This is Holburn, uh.

all of these places, um.

Walking tour So, and you can really demonstrates actually how

this agglomeration thing works, right?

Because clustering takes place in larger cities, you know, with

the people that do the same occupation.

It's not only that, you know, you get a clustering

of urban people, uh, together, but you get clustering of

very specific urban people in specific parts of the urban

area, uh.

So it's, it's actually not the left-hand side, it's the

right hand side, um, but.

You can see fishmongers tend to live in a gather

in a few different areas uh between the 15th and

16th century, right?

Um, and the fishmonger's all still exists.

Go and see it.

Uh, it's right on the Thames, I guess, understandably.

Um And then, you know, this kind of takes over

and when the guilds themselves become important political institutions, uh,

You know, maybe they influence where these things are founded,

but you know, there's definitely some evidence of organic.

Agglomeration Um, I mean, it's really interesting returning to this

behavioural thing which I said is a bit problematic in

trying to define what the city is and isn't, uh,

even back in the 12th century you can see people

talking about, uh, evil things that happen in the city,

right?

Um, so this guy is saying, look, whatever whatever evil

exists, right, you'll find it in London, um, there's people,

uh.

To go there, you shouldn't go to the dancing the

pander.

That is, um, houses of ill fame.

I do know what that is, uh, avoid the gamblers

and the dice makers, the theatre and the tavern.

I mean that's kind of interesting because like the theatre

is high sight, you know, um, but anyway, all of

these things saying that it's all this bad stuff, uh,

so if you don't want to live with the shameful,

you don't want to dwell in London, um, interesting, right,

uh.

Back to the economic stuff, right?

We know already how specialisation influences.

Innovation, but it's really important to see the London Hi

that has this capacity to raise output and generate surpluses,

you know, uh.

Even though London is providing relatively limited demand, um, But

especially after the Black Death, it really uh grows right?

London has its fortuitous kind of history of right around

the time that it exhausted all of the wood, uh,

you know, there's probably no wood left between here and

Brighton, you know, in the 17th century.

They chopped it all down and burned it all in

London.

Has to be right the time that coal comes online

as a fuel source, so that's very fortuitous.

Um, but from the 16th century this huge growth is

experienced by London makes it an engine of growth, right?

So this is what we if we restrict ourselves to

the mediaeval period looks something like this, right, grow grows

to 1300, maybe 70,000 people, uh, reduced, uh, in 1350

with the plague, uh, and then grows again faster than

national population does, but you really start to see it

take off right in the 17th century.

Um, and here, You can see how uh this works

relative to the national population.

Kind of following that curve and then somewhere in the

latter part of the 17th century it overtakes even the

national.

Right Some qualitative evidence that shows some of these things

we've been talking about, right, actual historical evidence, uh, to

pin on these theories, right, fish is seems to be

my example of the day, uh, but in 14th century

you have, uh, urban institutions providing regulation the fish trade

so that no fishmonger can forestall fish by land or

water.

Uh, under penalty of forfeiture and imprisonment.

So, does anybody know what forestalling is?

What do you think this means?

No fishmonger should forestall fish either by land or by

water.

I If somebody Google for solving.

have Yeah.

OK, so what do you think that means in the

context of selling fish?

Good, we're getting halfway there.

What's it, what, what happens in cities?

We talked about trade, right?

We talked about the rise of markets.

We talk about regulated trade in cities.

What's happening here is that they've decided there's a place

and a time where fish will be sold, right?

uh, and that's going to be a regulated environment if

you try to sell your fish outside of the time

and place, so not in the designated space and not

in the time, that's forestalling and it's illegal, right?

They don't want people selling outside of the regulated environment.

Um, and here, what do we have?

Uh, oh, so this is somebody saying that, uh, they

were trying to be an apprentice in a haberdashery, uh.

And uh doesn't like the way he's been treated.

So anyway, evidence that shows how much specialisation there is

in London even the 14th century.

um, now what's really interesting here is that this happens

organically in London and that's unique.

In most of Western Europe, London has no political control

or very little over rural hinterland, right?

So despite not, you know, commanding, uh, and extracting all

the resources it needs to flourish, it does it kind

of organically, uh, through, uh.

Economic channels, right, um, and often these privileges of large

urban communities appear oppressive to the countryside might have contributed

it to the Pennsy revolt in 1381, right?

One of the things the rebels talk about is they

want the freedom to buy and sell in all urban

areas.

Um, and this is, you know, part of the behavioural

definition and the difference that you see emerging between urban

dwellers and non-urban dwellers.

Um, but after the Black Debt is all kind of

starts to change, right?

And the network expands beyond London.

The recession after the Black Death is actually an advantage

because it has the resources to withstand economic slump, uh,

and basically it establishes London centrality in England, and that

has been the case ever since the Black Death, right?

Like I said, Norwich was the second most important city.

In England In the Middle Ages, You know, none of

you have been there.

It's not that important today.

Uh, we have, we have a very, very central, uh,

London centric economy, right?

And also after the black death, London's international uh trade

or increases quite a bit, uh, so it's maybe 35%

in 1300 and you know, almost uh 85% in 1540,

right?

Um, and by 15,020 London's taxable wealth is 10 times,

uh, than the next largest city.

It had only been 5 times in 1334.

So the narrative is that London was always, you know,

the most important city, uh, but it's, it's like relative

to other places.

It is only um.

Grown in that respect and I'm not sure if there's

any other.

Examples where one city dominates an economy to the degree

that London did and still does.

Um, you can see how this happens in 1400, how

almost everybody in the country owes debts to people who

live in London, showing that it's such a massive commercial

hub, right?

Um.

And you know, densely populated in this kind of home

county.

So here you can see between 1203 and uh the

end of the 15th century, right, the relative importance in

overseas trade, right, it's 17% in 1203, but it's 60%

at the end of the 15th century.

So London just really establishes itself back to the debt.

Um, so, to end on this, we have Tony Wrigley

again, who basically says London's urban demand was the most

important single factor.

Uh, engendering agricultural improvement before the industrial revolution, um, and

I'll leave it there.

Have a great reading week.

Yeah Oh wow.

Well, Have you finished?

I Oh my God, it's one of my favourite, it's

one of my favourite books, um, the best.

Uh probably.

you know.

um it's more like.

Movie has been made out.

I don't know if it's because it's too wild.

Yeah I just feel like.

I just try and make the cat CGI.

I How I In that square Yeah.

That's brilliant.

Enjoy the end.

Thank you.

But Yeah.

Yeah.

OK.

That's, that's a good way to interpret pre-industrial.

No.

So that would work.

Tell them, where where Alteration.

I exchange Yeah If you guys are Yeah So It's

really a separate thing.

But then you've said You're saying here that monetary the

Right, yeah.

Works as well because you're you're putting monetary.

You, you could put, you could include.

Yeah And if those, if those are the factors that

you want to talk about.

That should be in the introduction.

You can say, I will answer the question about.

No So for for the colony.

B Yeah I'll have to wait and read this, but

you really have Gone very broad So Have you got

Colon A source of resources You you don't take anything

from.

It's divergence between the two types of colon.

The way So the difference between, say,

Lecture 15:

I know we have that stillborn project on fiscal capacity.

Uh, no, basically it's still sitting there.

Yeah, I know it was all it was all quite

promising and then I guess we got distracted.

Uh, I also think it might be more might be

one of those things that's more trouble than it is

worth, but um.

You, I'm taking over, um, Will's yeah, so I'm his

paternity, so he's gonna.

I got to.

Like witches that like.

Yeah Oh, I guess.

I, I was watching um Apocalypse Now I thought you

you the the riders of Valky.

Have you been Yeah, can.

I've read a lot of stuff That.

Yeah.

the I Yeah, yeah.

So when did she say she can't see it.

That there between the letters.

I Yeah.

Yeah So classes Is this insane in addition?

But the thing actually I figured.

I'm trying to remember the significance of.

It's not just like the villain of the walking, but

it was symbol of.

Yeah.

everybody Yeah.

I don't know where Very So you have to think

this song the week for your election.

S.

And The one track.

Oh man, I, I'm not a record player now, so,

uh.

side 1 or side.

Yes, yeah.

What you, with a side 2 is, I guess B

side only applies to C.

Yeah.

Yeah that's right.

Yeah.

That to be a cassette.

or you.

No Are you going to the Black Sabbath reunion show

in Birmingham?

Oh wow, I think you'll have to get some highly

priced tickets now, but Well I think you have Parkinson's.

I think you'll probably be doing it in a wheelchair,

but I mean they might be.

for Alright, everybody.

Anybody know that one?

Anybody know the title of that one?

War Pigs?

I mean, I think actually, uh, well, I have to

give credit where credit is due.

Uh, this lecture is the brainchild of my colleague Zain,

uh, who suggested, uh, the after some deliberation, the song

of the week, and I think it probably is a

perfect one, and, uh, I've just had, is anybody going

to the Black Sabbath reunion?

I mean, my, my formative years were spent listening to

this, this album.

Uh, Black Sabbath is probably top 10 for sure, maybe

top 5 in the stretch.

Um, going to introduce, uh, our colleague Nick who is

taking over for Will, uh, who has not, I don't

think yet had his baby, but the baby is imminent,

uh.

But Nick is a PhD student, uh, working very much

on pre-industrial economic history, working on the dissolution of the

monasteries.

He's taught this course before.

He's going to give our lecture on the capacity in

a few weeks, so this is Nick, and, uh, he'll

see you all next week.

Yeah, nice to meet you guys.

I got a train to catch, so I'll see you

next week.

See you later.

So we'll start with this quote, uh, from a Cormac

McCarthy novel that full disclosure, I have not read, um,

but the judge is kind of like this warmongering character,

right?

He says it makes no difference what men think of

war.

war endures, right?

War was always here and it will always be here,

right?

So it's this idea that war is like an ever

present feature of, you know, human societies.

Gentlemen, can we, uh, We want to think about how

war.

Uh, interacts with Economic growth, right, or economic development war

isn't like a direct channel of growth, you know, it's

not as straightforward as trade createsmith and specialisation, right?

But if it is an ever present aspect uh of

societies, we need to think about what the consequences or

externalities of war might be for economic development, um, and.

So we're going to look at this.

I mean, war is a horrible thing.

It has huge uh human toll, right?

Uh, and we're going to see some of that, um.

Today, uh, that can't be denied, um, but since it

is such an enduring aspect of societies and economies, we

need to understand how this interaction works.

So some key questions, right?

How do societies, right, how the states, once they evolve,

whatever group or units of analysis you might think of,

how do they organise resources for war?

That's really, really important, right?

If you take a modern history course, maybe you bought

an economic history course.

It would be a fair question of were both World

War or the outcomes of both World Wars a direct

result of economic factors, right?

So economic uh factors play a deciding role in wars,

right?

What we'll actually see as well is that war plays,

uh, it, it's a two-way causal causality, right?

War actually plays a fundamental role in the development of

economies, right?

So, uh, not only can wars be decided by.

Uh, economic factors, but the development of economic factors can

be determined by warfare, right?

And usually, you know, that happens through the technological channel

in the pre-industrial world, right?

Uh, you need to think about how warfare has shaped

technological development, um, and again that's true in the pre-industrial

world and in the modern world, right?

A lot of 20th century, uh.

Technological innovation in the United States can be attributed to

joint, uh, you know, government and private sector military research,

right?

Um but war also shapes economic and political systems and

finally we want to think about how war contributes to

growth, right?

Uh, and in the pre-industrial world where West diverges from

east, uh, war has been argued to have been.

One of if not the most decisive factors in determining

the great divergence, right, at least that's what Hoffman would

argue.

So the interesting thing here that we all know, uh,

the devastating effects war can have, but in the long

run, we can see how war, uh.

Can create economic growth or at least contribute to it.

Well, you actually have to ask them this is it,

is it a zero-sum game?

War is a prime mover in economic growth.

Is that basically at the expense of, you know, some

other group who's losing?

Is it a zero-sum game?

I think that's what we want to think about, right?

Um.

Long view of war we'll talk about that.

The military revolution, uh, is, uh, a big part of

the narrative of the early modern world that we want

to talk about, um, and then we want to think

about how war, uh, interacts, uh, especially in the context

of this, uh, great divergence debate, right?

So the long run narrative of warfare.

that over a period of, you know, 4 or 5

centuries, right, war becomes less frequent, but much more severe,

right?

Um.

So we started off this course by talking about feudal

societies and how the origins of mediaeval feudal social structures

were designed to protect people from, you know, some kind

of environment that approached what we would call anarchy, right,

a period of almost constant warfare, right?

Everybody is living.

constant fear of the next marauding band of whoever that

might arrive at your village, right?

Now some of that is stereotyped, uh, and perhaps a

bit exaggerated, but it's very clear that war and violence,

you know, uh, have declined over.

Um, time, especially if we're looking at great powers fighting

with each other.

Um, you know, so you're talking about, you know, 2.6

wars per decade in the 16th century, uh, half or

2/3 of a percent.

Yeah, or uh.

Half a war or or 2/3 of a war per

decade, right?

Uh less than 1 per decade.

Uh And You know there's this great quote uh.

Don't know exact I can't remember exactly what was rearticulated

by one of my uh favourite Canadian punk rock bands.

It says something like, you know, it was less than

100 years in human history, uh, without, uh, or wars

weren't being fought, um, which I'm not exactly sure how

you put the numbers to come up with that, but.

It's clear over the period we're talking about and beyond

that the percentage of years under warfare declines from, you

know, almost every year to half.

This comes from Charles Tilly, who most famously says war

made the state and the state made war, right?

Um.

Wars are also getting shorter right from an average of

1.6 years.

Now that's going to be wildly, uh, wildly in the

16th to 17th centuries, um, the average is going to

be wildly pulled by some massive outliers like the 30

Years' War, right, um, but.

It's getting less frequent, uh, over a period, um.

But Whilst wars are getting less frequent.

considerably more violent, considerably more deadly, right?

So 95% of war-related deaths have occurred from the 16th

to the 20 start with 2 So Most of the

war-related deaths have happened in this period.

Now, That's a startling statistic.

When you, when you factor in population change, uh, you

know, the growth of global populations in that period, you

might start to think that it's less surprising, uh, and,

but Wars less frequent but more bloody.

Um, when you start to think about who are these

great powers, right?

uh.

We're talking about states, uh, we haven't yet dealt comprehensively

with state formation of what the state actually is, uh,

that's when we've come with, uh, Nick Fletcher, but waging

war.

You know, is one of if not the, you know.

First mandates of of of a state, right?

A state by definition is somebody who uh owns a

monopoly of violence, right?

Um, so a great power then becomes defined as somebody

who has a major role in international politics, but with

respect to security, and security is probably synonymous with war

here.

Um, so when they are measuring war, uh, between great

powers, this is who we're talking about.

Um, and.

Great powers emerge because they're successful.

Right, to a lesser extent they're successful at keeping their

domestic populations happy.

um, but what we're going to see in this great

divergence debate is how an explanation for how Europe went

on to conquer the world, right?

Uh, it's one of the darkest periods of European history,

uh, it's colonial past, but we have to understand.

How parts of the globe, uh, you know, relatively small

parts of the globe in terms of land mass, relatively

small in terms of population, went on to control most

of it for a period of time and that channel,

right, is arguably uh warfare.

Um, and.

We're dealing in the early modern world.

Uh We're starting this decline and edging towards less frequent

warfare, but, uh, in the early period, you know, we're

perhaps perhaps not in a state of almost constant anarchy

because we in the early modern period we coalesced from

little tribes.

Uh little fiefdoms into larger, uh, engrossments, uh, and, and

budding states but they're almost constantly fighting with each other,

right?

And the ones who come out on top of this

um, you know, regular warfare become these great powers, uh,

and it's essentially, you know, a rent seeking zero sum

game for these leaders.

So you know, the story goes is that.

You know, uh, everybody's looking at it in terms of

territory, in terms of wealth, in terms of prestige as

a zero-sum game, right?

That's the Flanders quote, not about how big the cake

was, uh, but how big a slice any ruler could

actually get his hands on, right.

This is starting to sound actually eerily familiar given the

uh political winds in the last uh In the last

Few months, I think, right?

um.

Cooperation to create peace is about enlarging the cake, uh,

and everybody slice with it.

um, in the early modern world, people are less interested

in that, but seeing how much of the cake they

can take, uh, we might be a world we're sadly

returning to, um, anyway, uh.

But war has huge spillover effects on how economies function,

right?

This article has a great quote that says, the need

to finance war makes money more valuable.

Um, and therefore increases the benefits of state building, right?

Um, when war becomes costly, right, because they're getting less

frequent, the stakes are getting higher, uh, the stronger, more

cohesive, less fragmented power invests more in state capacity.

You might think of state capacity as being synonymous with

its ability to wage war, right, uh, weaker powers that

drop out of the competition, right?

So that's how greater powers emerge.

So the game at the kind of political economy level

of these great powers becomes one of collecting more tax.

Therefore, you can afford to wage more and more effective

war.

You have a greater chance of winning the war, and

then you're more likely to keep fighting or enjoy the

privilege of continuing to fight.

You don't have to drop out and then you have

more tickets in the lottery to win more wars, right?

um.

So in meeting England very centralised, you know, right back

until the Norman conquest and even before that arguably, um,

Crown doesn't have to spend very much in the early

modern period to overcome domestic competitors to his power because

basically the only game in town, uh, collecting taxes efficiently,

therefore participates in European war more effectively goes on to

become a great power, right?

Contrast that with Poland or the historical antecedents of Poland,

where power is very diffused, uh, decentralised, fragmented into little

spheres of influence by, you know, nightless.

Little dukes and things like that, um.

Very difficult to collectively.

Combined resources to wage war against these emerging European great

powers, right?

And in 1795 Poland ceases to be a stage altogether,

uh, and then endures a very, uh, troubled, uh, history

from that point with constantly fighting off, uh.

You know, it's neighbours.

But it, Poland does not become a great power.

So the argument goes, because it lacks central authority and

lacked basically what uh Nick will call state capacity in

a couple weeks.

OK, so moving on to this military revolution.

What is it?

Uh, has anybody heard this term before?

Hands up if you've heard about the military revolution.

Nobody's heard this one Less less of a uh.

Less famous than I thought anyway, uh, so the deal

is that there's a fundamental transformation into how war is

fought in the early, in the, in the early modern

era, right?

Uh, and a lot of this has to do with

the centralization of power over this period, um, but the

stylized facts would be before the military revolution, uh, wars

are kind of.

Relatively arbitrary things, wage at the whims of individual rulers,

uh, who at short notice have to find both the

fighters and the funds to fund their fighting.

Uh, at short notice.

So, uh, you know, the king of England needs to

wage war against the French, or he needs to wage

war against the Scottish.

Uh, it happens, uh, on very kind of short notice.

Um, he needs to find men to fight.

Uh, he might, you know, in the later periods need

to seek approval from parliament to do that in earlier

periods not.

Then he needs money and food, which he'll requisition through

the forced sale process called purveyance, and he might hire

mercenaries, right, professional fighters to go and fight in France

or in Scotland.

Right?

One kind of Enduring truth of pre-industrial history, if you

ever get time travelled back to the pre-industrial world.

I don't, don't take that Um, but if you do

do it right, make sure you pay your mercenary.

That's the one kind of historical truism.

If you don't pay your mercenaries, they just turn on

you, um, which we've seen very recently in, you know,

uh, Russian, the Russian war, right, where you had the

mercenaries, uh, marching on Moscow for a time, um, but

what happens in the 16th century, uh, is you get

the development of a professional military.

Right?

A professional military, it's no longer ad hoc, right?

Uh, it's a standing.

Citizen based.

Professional group of soldiers, right?

Because you have emerging military technologies, uh, a need for

larger armies to wage, uh, these less frequent but more

costly wars.

They require training, uh, all of this stuff requires money

typically funded by emerging taxation systems which we'll discuss in

the state capacity lecture, right?

Um.

So, it's kind of a tactical solution, uh, And this

Roberts guy says that it it it's uh emerges from

the need to figure out how one is going to

combine newly emerging gunpowder projectile weapons with the kind of

more historical forms of close portrait combat.

Um, and when it places the financial burden of warfare

on the state or on society as a whole.

It ceases to become something that a.

ruler does kind of quasi personally and more uh something

the state does collectively.

But in military terms, what it means is you now

have increasingly large professional standing armies, right?

Um.

And all these tech innovations like castles, right, uh, they're

the kind of mediaeval, uh, military big mediaeval technology, right?

They have a purpose of dominating the landscape and demonstrating

authority, but they're basically the main strategic military technology, uh,

you know, before the longbow perhaps, uh, but then when

you get gunpowder weapons that could easily penetrate the walls

of castles, then tactics change you can.

Fortification, um, but ultily war becomes more and more expensive,

uh, and The Principal agent problems involved in managing increasingly

complex tactics that are required to manage the proliferation of

new weapons requires a professional army that's better trained.

Um, and there's a whole field, I think, you know,

military history that talks about very famous people like Zivorov

or others, you know, these geniuses that had, uh, developed

new tactics to manage all of this new military technology,

right, um, and you know this is a fantastic matrix

on the economics of.

History that looks at manpower logistics, technology, um, um, you

know, these are all the solutions to the economic problems

of warfare, right?

Uh, I won't, you know, you can study it yourself,

uh, if this interests you, but it's, it's a very

fantastic way of thinking about these things.

Uh, so you put all this together and it puts

a really interesting and compelling timeline.

Together for this military revolution, right?

So.

You know, before, uh, the modern era.

You have a kind of quasi-professional infantry, so the Romans

in many ways were ahead of the game, uh, so

they do have these professional standing army, the Roman Legionnaire,

um, and then they kind of step aside for mounted

knights, right?

We've, we've talked about how the stirrup created feudalism.

This is the era we're in in the high mediaeval

period, right?

Um, and then we get a quasi-professional infantry.

Right, uh, but these are mostly Going to be mercenary

soldiers, uh.

We have the rise of castles being built with better

defences, uh, siege warfare, right, um, they require larger armies,

right, and this is a war of attrition wars in

this period only infrequently resulting clear offensive victories, right?

There's a war of attrition basically who can keep their

uh supply lines going long enough um to.

Uh, you know, avoid starvation.

Um, then in the 15th century, gunpowder weapons are developed,

right?

Despite the fact that China had had this technology for

centuries, Europeans finally figured it out in the in the

15th century, and they're so effective against castles that castles

have to be reinforced, uh, with this, you know, the

star shape, um, star shaped defences, right?

Have I shown these star forts to anybody?

Have I showed them to you guys yet?

Nobody seen a star for yet?

OK, I mean, I love Star Force so much and

there's a chance.

Um, you can find them all over Europe.

Uh, the kingdom of Venice has lots, and the city

you can, you can visit a star fort now.

I mean, it's one of my drive my wife crazy

with kind of stops the star forts when we're travelling

around.

Uh, does anybody know why?

You get the development of this star shaped.

Fortification.

Anybody have any ideas?

Anybody want to speculate?

The idea is, right.

Um, If there's somebody up there on that wall, you

know, if I can get close enough.

They can't shoot And I can Walls, you know, plant

explosives, whatever.

But if there's something that juts out over there.

I'm no longer safe.

So there's no dead spots for this siege warfare, and

it's also reinforced against, uh, cannon fire, right?

Um, then in the 16th century, you get the uh

navy.

You know, warfare expands to the sea, and this is

the really key um chapter in kind of intercontinental warfare,

we'll see.

Um, like I said, you know, there's a range of

these great men in military history.

Military history is kind of a narrative of great men

to begin with, uh, but you know, there's one example

of Prince of Orange, right, who revolutionises military tactics, uh,

in fighting, um, the Dutch Empire's war against the Spanish

Empire, right?

uh.

But this quote is fantastic here.

It says it's not longer just a kind of collection

of a motley crew of bellicose individuals, uh, which you

know is a bit of a straw man argument about

feudal, um.

mediaeval warfare which is not devoid of tactics, uh, but

there it's an articulated organism where each part responds to

impulses from above as it takes orders, right?

This is how, uh, this famous military historian Roberts is

discussing the, uh, military revolution, um, so you can see

the huge increase in army sizes, right?

France, end of the 15th century is like 20 or

30,000, you know, they're nearly 50,000.

Uh, less than 1 England, um, you know, It's a

bit more irregular but going from 14,000 to 15,000 in

the 16th century, right, uh, in, you know, basically less

than 50 years, uh, if you want to expand that

into the 18th century, you see some staggering numbers, right?

For it has a standing military 55,000, uh, in the

middle of the 17th century, 300,000.

18th century Um, Britain goes from 16,000 less impressively uh

to 47,000 that's still.

Uh, so Russia, you know.

Still have Biggest army in the middle of the 18th.

Um, now, you know, fiscal capacity is kind of a

word that uh sounds boring but it's really, really important,

uh, because how is all of the all these hugely

expanding armies you need to pay their wages, all of

these fancy new gunpowder technologies, maritime, uh, you know, navy

ships that all needs to be paid for.

The cost of the navy ship is absolutely huge.

Um, and that requires, uh, a way to pay for

it, and the way to pay for it is that

these states devise taxes, right?

So anybody who doesn't feel, uh, particularly, um.

You know, isn't a fan of taxes.

Usually taxes now are to provide for the welfare state.

In Europe, right?

And, and the military is a small part of that.

So this, you know, discussion now, uh, you know, about

the world we're entering into is spending 3% of GDP

on the military, hugely more expensive.

probably Um, but you can see basically uh how army

size is increasing right in step with taxation, right?

These two things are very highly correlated.

Taxes increase because these European states need to pay for

their larger, more professional armies, um, right.

You're moving, um.

From mercenaries to professional armies, uh, and.

That uh doesn't mean that the mercenaries entirely disappear.

There's actually a very sophisticated, uh.

sophisticated contracting system to pay for mercenaries that shows how

the crown, uh, you know, uses financiers to get capital,

uh, which, you know, they then used to provide, uh,

munitions or material as it's called in the military.

Literature, right, um.

And then the crown goes to a middleman, uh, who

will provide uh mercenary troops, um, and there might be

some kind of.

Enterprising high level, you know, merchant of mercenaries who then

finds these colonels who mobilise the battalion, right?

Um, and the interesting thing you know about mercenaries, uh,

is that because there's such a high risk of the

crown or the leader or whoever not paying them.

Um They get paid so little that they actually earn

a lot of their income from looting and pillaging, and

this is true in the 13th century, in the 14th

century, in the 15th century all the way up to

the kind of end of merceary periods and actually, you

know, as you'll see in the last slide here, you

know, mercenary armies are kind of making a resurgence.

They're being used in Ukraine right now and there's all

sorts of narratives of looting and pillaging by mercenaries, so

that's kind of a stylized fact of mercenary earnings.

Um, the master's thesis I read once did a fantastic

job of showing how much money, uh, a kind of

low level mercenary soldier in the 100 Years' War could

make, and most of it was from looting and pillaging

in France.

Um, So, it becomes a very kind of sophisticated intertwined

financial network.

To provide uh these new gunpowder weapons uh to growing

uh armies in these European great powers, right?

That's the narrative of the Military revolution.

Now, what is the role of war in this great

divergence, right?

Well, let's think about the Malthusian world that we're already

familiar with.

Um, so we see urbanisation rates between China and Europe.

And going from the 8th century to the 19th.

And basically.

rehearsed this already, um, about the intricate relationship between population

and resources.

But basically Europe is uh speeding ahead from China in

terms of standards of living, uh, in large part because

China is mired in this involution trap, uh, where they

can't escape Malthusian dynamics and the man versus land ratio,

right?

Uh, arguably, what kind of breaks this equilibrium is born,

right?

Um, so before the mid 18th century, most war deaths

occurred by the spread of disease, right, not far from

fighting, uh, directly, uh, these soldiers place global economic strain

on the resources, right?

And they also carry diseases as they.

It's also, you know, a lot of violence directed towards

civilian populations, which is illegal now in our modern, um,

you know, kind of doctrine of war governed by Geneva

Conventions, uh, but all of these things you hear about

the pre-industrial period like burnings of fields or in the

100 Years' War, the English called the Chevychet, right, where

they just kind of destroy whole villages as they.

Marau around the French countryside, um, but.

The kind of flow chart here is that soldiers move

around, they spread disease, uh, that kills both soldiers and

the civilian population.

This is the positive check, right?

Uh, think of that famous Derwoodcu we've looked at.

War is one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse,

right?

It's a positive check.

Um, And we, we kind of talked about positive checks

when we looked at the Malthusian system, um, but this

is an articulation exactly of how war works as a

positive check, right?

So all boils down to the fact whichever country fights

the most.

You know, suffers the most casualties and it ends up,

you know, growing more than those countries which did not

because uh.

On the one hand, you have basically fewer mouths to

feed.

Now, um, we can look at the causes of death

of troops in wartime, right?

Basically this point here is that disease always outpaces combat.

In terms of soldier mortality, right?

Um, now, The interesting thing here, uh, and perhaps it's

counterintuitive, is that you see a positive correlation uh between

warfare, uh, and indicators of economic development.

So the plots up here.

A scattered plot of the average number of wars per

year between the 14th and 18th centuries, right, uh, with

urbanisation, uh, over the same period of time.

urbanisation here is being used as a proxy for economic

development.

Last week it's a positive correlation, right?

Uh, same thing between war on the x axis, but

look at.

GDP growth rates, it's a long scale, right?

Also a positive correlation, you know, in both places, you

know, you're seeing, I don't have my clicker here today,

um, but you're seeing, you know, the outliers driving this

are The Netherlands and England is kind of what you

would expect.

The economic gravity of Europe has shifted to the North

Sea area, right?

Um, and a lot of the Uh Ability for war

to I guess maybe generate economic growth or at least

be correlated with it positively uh is through the innovations

in gunpowder weapons, right?

So we just told the story about the the military

revolution which looks at the need to finance larger armies

and pay for all of their expensive uh innovation.

Um, but what happens here in terms of the great

divergence is that Europe has an advantage in gunpowder weapons.

Right?

And they also have a very unique.

Style of warfare, the so-called tournament model, which means they're

fighting with each other very frequently, uh, they all want

to become these great states that we talked about so

the stakes are kind of.

Uh, and they use these gunpowder weapons.

More frequently in Europe against each other in these kind

of intrastate competitions, um, so that they develop relative to

the rest of the world a huge level of superiority

of gunpowder weapons, right?

And this is basically, you know, uh what Joel Mul

would call, you know, learning by doing, um, so you

can see here how, you know, the weapons play such

a dramatic.

Uh, role in this and you end up with weapons

being more affordable in Europe than they are in China.

Um, and this is a very interesting graph.

So it's Europe in grey, China in black.

And we're looking at the number of conflicts on the

Y axis and, you know, it's pretty similar up until

the middle of the 17th century.

Uh, when you see.

The grey lines gonna take off, uh, and the black

line, you know, the conflicts in China actually go down

a little bit, uh, but what is most important here

is that China has some, you know, conflict over dynastic

succession, but for most of this period it's a pretty

cohesive centralised empire, right?

um.

Now, we talked earlier about within Europe, how being a

centralised units of authority uh gives.

You know, The states that go on to become great

powers in Europe like Britain and France.

a range of other places, gives them an advantage in

intra-European competition.

But in China, there's nobody to compete with, right?

Um, so what happens in the middle of the 17th

century is That the conflicts between European powers, relatively speaking,

are much higher than uh any kind of conflict that

China is having, which leads to this kind of seminal

article by Phil Hoffman who asks maybe one of the

guiding questions in long run economic history overall, right?

Why was it Europe who went on to conquer the

world, right?

And this is like, like I said, it's the darkest

period of European history.

But as economic historians, we have to understand uh how

Europe was able to conquer and colonise, um, right?

So.

Here we have between the beginning of the 16th century,

uh, and the beginning of the, and the end of

the 18th century, right?

Um, the percent of time the countries at war against

foreign enemies, so that's kind of key to Hoffman's argument,

uh, and you can see between France and England, Great

Britain, Spain, right, there's a lot more time spent fighting

relative to China, right?

Uh, and most of the wars that China's involved in

are against nomads, right?

It's not might versus might really.

Um, so European war relies on gunpowder, and from the

16th century war is usually against nomads, and that doesn't

require gunpowder, or at least they don't use it.

Uh, so Europe is developing gunpowder weapons and the expertise

to use them tactically.

In this kind of military revolution, right, at a far

greater rate than China is.

And the the Hoffman argument argues that this is what

allows uh Europe to steam ahead.

Especially if you think of the great divergence debate as

being something of a zero-sum game, right?

Uh, is that it allows Europe to have a monopoly

of violence because there's come out to the early modern

period so much better at warfare.

Uh, largely because they have better gunpowder weapons, uh, they

can use them more effectively.

Uh, they have bigger armies that they can provide these

weapons to, and they can fund the armies because they've

developed state capacity and tax systems right to pay for.

Um, now, China had gunpowder weapons, you know, uh, in

the 10th century.

This early gunpowder rage is all in China, right?

It's not until the 13th century that guns really appear

in Europe.

But what you see is that basically all of uh.

These, you know, gunpowder weapons, uh, end up, uh, you

know, it, it's there's nothing in the Europe didn't have

a technological advantage, uh, in this period.

What they had was an advantage in almost constant warfare

that allows them to, you know, develop the technology, refine

the technology, but also refine the tactics, uh, to use

the technology, right?

Um, I think it's kind of interesting to maybe end

on here, uh, is that this military revolution that I've

talked about, uh, this goes kind of hand in hand

with the development of state capacity, the, you know, rise

of great European powers who kind of squashed their European

competitors became very, very good, uh, at using gunpowder weapons

against each other.

Uh, so that when you know the Portuguese, uh, and

then the Spanish invented maritime technology that allowed them to

cross oceans effectively all of a sudden instead of pointing

these gunpowder weapons at each other, they turned them outward,

um, and have a very, very successful time of conquering

other places in the world with their being state administered,

paid for by centrally, you know, administered state taxation.

In the longer run history, maybe this is anomalous, right?

Um, so the quote goes that holy state recruited the

state administrative military force is a historical anomaly, right?

um, and.

Between the 18th and the 20th centuries this is kind

of the way things are done but before that period

we're talking about, uh, mercenaries, right, contractors, and this graph

is really, really interesting because it shows, right, and through

the American lens how in the First World War it's

basically 95% American troops, right?

That's government funded.

Through taxation, modern army, right.

Actually it's more than 10% of military workforce in World

War II, uh, the American military workforce is contractors.

And then you start to see how this changes over

the course of successive wars to the point that in

Afghanistan, you know, there's far more, uh, private military contractors

than there are American troops, right?

um.

You know, and now sadly, you know, especially in the

last few weeks with all of these questions about, uh,

whether, you know, we're perhaps returning to a more isolationist

state you see countries actually talking about these very developments,

right?

We may need maybe we have more need for a

domestic military than we thought we did over the last

80 years, right?

If we do.

Decide we need that, or if, you know, we're forced

into acknowledging that we need that, how are we going

to pay for it?

Right, uh, well, it's largely going to be through taxation

in one way or another, right?

um, so.

we're seeing some of these concerns that have played out

over, you know, centuries in our period and you're starting

to reappear, uh, in the 21st century.

Um, all right, I'll leave it there.

Thank you.

I have posted the summit of essay questions to the.

Um, The deadline is the 28th of March.

Let's look at them quickly.

Um, That uh.

Here we go.

Right, so 2000 word essay, right?

It sounds like a big number.

It's actually a blessing, right?

It gives you more opportunity to provide evidence.

You're not as constrained and you're fighting fit now, having

written a number of uh short formative essays, you've gotten

feedback from Greg and Will, right?

There's 4 questions, choose one of them.

Um, first one, right, goes all the way back to

the beginning.

How important is climate for geography, right?

Find some historical evidence to argue one way or another.

How much is surplus extraction, you know, how valuable is

that as an explanation, right?

An example.

urbanisation and then the fourth question is about state development.

The lecture and that comes in a couple of weeks,

but you can read ahead.

All right, see you guys later.

Yeah Yeah Yeah.

Oh.

right.

And then on Sunday.

I think.

I I I Yeah It's so sad.

Hello, hello.

It's not a louds.

It's not hard at all, they're fine.

It's.

To OK.

Georgia was here.

Georgia, Georgia.

Hello, hello, uh.

Right.

Yes.

Yeah.

Oh I E How you.

OK here.

Wait, you're remark.

Yeah of course Because of the Oh Hello.

Uh, I did, no, I did.

Got 36.

I you.

She got she.

Oh bro, I genuinely got 50, genuinely did.

Exactly.

90, which is 40%, and then I got 20% extra

$90 I think.

It's not.

You're doing this in the middle of a lecture with

scare me.

If you.

Hello.

Um, George, my boy.

Voice is gone.

Voice is gone after yesterday.

Well Oh.

Wow.

Oh, today I had a meeting with Alex Green.

I turned up 15 minutes.

And The.

She does not care.

Yes.

No sto, this is the worst type of ever.

Why what.

Your future.

Um, nail tapping.

Oh, have you seen this honeycomb once?

Oh Hopefully he's Let.

Lecture 16:

Say all in one I Oh Hey Come on.

So you want to come sit up here and be

interviewed all day.

Uh, Yeah Yeah I Hello.

Hello.

You're probably.

Hi.

Hi.

lecture.

Say something.

I'm OK.

Come on.

All right.

Anybody know that one?

Did you shazam it?

OK.

OK, that's a step there.

So anybody know the title of the song?

OK, OK, mint down under.

So what is The connection, uh, tenuous though it may

be, uh, between this song and the question of culture.

I, I feel like the song lyrically is a bit

about uh.

Culture shock perhaps.

So that's the best I could do.

If anybody has a better song of the week for,

uh, culture and this role in economic history, please do

send me something.

I love, I love this too, but like, not sure

if the connection is as strong as it might be.

Uh, anyway, so.

Moving on, uh.

I'll just close YouTube, uh, before my algorithm does something

embarrassing.

Uh, and we want to talk a bit about culture.

Today, um, First broadly and then kind of feed into

institutions as a term, right?

And when I use institutions here, I'm meaning it in

the Douglas North new institutional economic sense, right?

Uh, because, uh, culture is a big part of that,

and institutions, I'm sure you've encountered them already in the

literature, uh, but going forward in your time at LSE

there, you know, you almost certainly going to hear about

them again.

So we want to talk about culture.

Culture slash values, right, as two maybe roughly synonymous terms

and economic behaviour, right?

I'm gonna present you with two case studies, uh, the

Protestant work ethic.

And broadly culture values uh and In the Islamic world

in the Middle East.

So basically, Protestant values uh versus, you know, an Islamic

value system and what Those cultural slash intellectual environments might,

what effects they might have had on economic development, uh,

and this is, then we'll talk about some critiques, various

debates, problems with this line of reasoning, certainly problems with

the arguments themselves, and then some conclusions.

uh, so.

The broad, broad question, right?

What is culture?

You know, we want to use a different term, what

are values?

Anybody wants to take a stab at this.

Any anthropology class takers in this room?

Anybody had a definition of culture so far anywhere in

their studies?

Nobody yet.

Uh, OK.

So moving on, even harder question, what extent to culture

or values, uh, to what extent do culture or value

shape economic decision making?

Right?

So, somebody Google culture for me.

Somebody Google culture.

Once you have an answer, stick up your hand.

Uh, we can have a little race, horse race here

to see who finds it first.

Let's see what we can get for culture.

Yes.

Institutions As well Wow, and where does this definition come

from?

The verbose dictionary.

Wikipedia.

All right, so like 14 different people have edited this

page for sure, and they've each added one term.

Um, they've stolen my institutional fire, but a system of

shared beliefs, a system of shared values, some kind of

common denominator, uh, shared between some group of people, right?

I think great, you want to add anything to this?

Am I missing anything?

Cricket, cricket culture.

OK.

Uh, I'm North American, that goes straight over my head.

I can't get, I can't get on board with any

game that takes 5 bloody days and then it ends

in a tie.

I mean.

Sorry, um, even harder question, right?

Uh, and this is where our case studies come in,

right?

Can we explain or even predict economic performance based on

differences in cultural norms, right?

Uh, so 3 layers of reasoning and arguing here that

we have to deal with, um.

I mean, uh, different flavour, uh, the same kind of

question which you might see is our economic growth and

development value free?

Are these agnostic things, right?

Is neoclassical economic theory agnostic, um, you know, uh, interesting

question.

Uh, and further, you know, our values, you know, and

internal or external to economic activity.

Are they endogenous or exogenous?

Um, point here.

If anybody wanted to try to get a sense of

the various ways that Greg and I could uh answer

a que ask a question.

You know, about this topic on an exam, you would

want to look at the slides we've just gone through.

Um, so, uh, I had some help with this lecture,

uh, from my colleague, uh, Monik, my colleague David, uh,

at Utrech and KCL I'm trying to, you know, crowdsource,

uh, you know, different ways to motivate and inform what

is actually a very, very difficult topic, right?

Um, because.

Culture values institutions that obviously play some role, right?

I think of culture as a black box, right?

We talked about inputs and outputs, you know, in a

production function way, um, it's the same kind of logic

in that you have labour, you have capital, um, right,

uh.

And they get input, but what comes out the other

side obviously depends on the culture that you're working in,

but it's very, very difficult, uh, to quantitatively, uh, figure

out, you know, what's going on, which is why I

call it a bit of a black box problem.

Um, so, first case study, uh, Protestant work ethic, right?

Um.

Anybody read German?

Do you know what the full title is Fantastic.

Uh, that's the full title written by Max Weber, so

he's very, very, uh, influential in sociological circles, right?

Um, he actually considered himself an historian, uh, slightly different

translation for the Anglophiles is, you know, Protestant work ethic,

uh, and the spirit of capitalism, um, and.

He's a social theorist, very, very influential, right?

Uh, so I don't have my clicker today, so I

have to remember to remain close to the keyboard.

So in this book, he claims that the Calvinist doctrine

of predestination caused people to work harder in order to

prove that they were worthy of heaven, right?

They're motivated to succeed at their calling, whatever that might

be.

Uh, they earn their salvation through hard work.

This hard work.

Is capitalist growth.

Uh, as historians, right, there's two terms to unpack here.

Uh, what is a Calvinist?

Are there any Calvinists in the room?

OK.

OK, one step back, a Calvinist is distinct from a

A Catholic, right, uh, and an umbrella term under which

Calvinists would be filed is Protestant, right?

So there's Catholics, there's Protestants, there's this little event, uh,

first in Europe for wildly different reasons, uh, the Reformation,

um, where, uh, we get a different branch of Christianity,

right?

So now we have Protestants and Catholics.

Calvinists are a kind of, uh, Protestant, but they believe

in predestination, right?

What's predestination?

Hm Good.

So, To kind of couch this in the series of

questions, the portfolio of questions we started with, for Weber,

the religious values held by, you know, Calvinists compared to

the religious values held by others explained social and economic

developments, right?

The religious values that these people held explained uh the

economic growth that happened in Western Europe and not in

other places, right?

So, right, he's interested in why modern economic growth emerges

first in Western Europe.

Um, he uses these interesting terms, but he thinks there's

an economic ethic.

Uh, for every religion, right?

There's a religious determination of life conduct, um, Now, when

he's, you know, espousing about China, he, he says that

China lacks the kind of religious values that are needed

to stimulate capitalism, right?

Where have we heard this before?

You have to think back many, many weeks before Christmas,

but what does this sound like to you?

Kind of Passing comment about China.

Uh Tacked on to the end of a thesis.

By a 19th century white man, right?

This sounds a lot like Malthus, you know, a lot,

I don't know what what was in the water in

the 19th century for white European men, but they just

kind of, uh, well, I know exactly what it was,

right?

So this is very deterministic, very teleological, right?

So Malthus.

He says, OK, Europe is growing faster than Asia.

It must be because we have a more favourable man

to land population resources model.

It's why our wages are higher and our economic growth

is more robust, whereas living standards are low in Asia

and it must be because they have a less favourable

balance of the variables that I have determined.

important.

Weber is making very much the same intellectual move, right?

He's saying, look, it's actually not about population and resources.

It's not about specialisation and Smithian growth.

It's actually about something more fundamental.

It's about religion, it's about your beliefs, uh, and he

says, look, Western Europe, uh, economy is growing, um, this

isn't happening in China.

But now the, the difference is that there's something uh

about the religion, uh, religious values of, you know, a

certain sect of, uh, Christianity that are explaining this, right?

So, His, I mean, you might think of that last

thing I just tacked on there as an explanation for

the great divergence, right?

I'm really missing my laser pointer today.

Uh, but so this is saying, OK, Europe grows rich,

Asia does not because of religious values.

I mean, it also extends to the little divergence, right?

Why Northwestern Europe.

Uh, their economy grows larger faster than East and Southern

Europe, right, where Catholics tend to predominate.

So here you have, uh, the welfare ratio, right?

Does anybody remember what a welfare ratio is?

You've counted it before.

This is just a real wage, right?

It's the multiples of the baskets of goods you need

to buy to have a reasonable standard of living, right?

So if your welfare ratio of one, you can buy

one basket.

Uh, 2, you can buy double baskets, etc.

etc.

Uh, so the Catholics here are getting, you know, precariously

close to subsistence, probably a little bit above, uh, in

the 18th century.

But anyway, the point is, right, there's some quantitative evidence

now that seems to give a little bit of, uh,

empirical edge to Weber's ideas, right?

Protestant places seem to be richer than Catholic places.

So, is there something innate about Protestantism?

Do they have some kind of unique Protestant work ethic,

right?

Well, the kind of thinking that we as economicors need

to do here is ask, is this correlation or is

this causation, right?

The correlation, you know, and I could show this to

you in a scaffer plot that we could, you know,

calculate the coefficient to determination or something.

There seems to be correlation here, but is there causation

or, you know, are there other unobserved things in this,

you know, effectively binary relationship that are driving this, right?

What might the possibilities be?

So, several critiques have emerged um of the Protestant work

ethic, which I mean, you might expect in some ways

for a thesis that's like 100 years old or more,

um, but I should actually have asked you to critique

this before uh I showed you this slide because we

already know this stuff, right?

There's a, you know, in all the weeks up until,

uh, today, right, we've essentially been talking about things that

you would call, you know, capitalist or at least capitalist

adjacent happening, you know, well before the Reformation.

So before Protestantism, before Calvinists even exist, people are, you

know, experiencing capitalist things, right?

Banking, credit, trade, etc.

etc.

um, Georgia McCloskey famously argues that look, uh, it's innovation,

not savings and hard work that explain industrialization, right?

Because you dig down a little bit deeper in the

vapour thing it's a book.

Calvinists work really hard.

They also save their money and invested in themselves, uh,

rather than spending it, um, frivolously, you know, that's kind

of a moral superiority that's better for economic growth, right?

McCloskey is saying actually savings don't have anything to do

with it, uh, it's innovation.

Um, so it's not about your work ethic, it's not

about how much you can say, it's about how innovative

your society is.

Uh, Anderson will look at Cistercians, right?

Catholic branch, monastic order.

Um, which just was Benedictine, I guess, right?

Uh, but the Cistercians, you know, I think, uh, they

have a very similar set of values.

They tend to try to set up their monasteries further

away from, um, Well, from other humans live a little

bit more of an isolated life, uh, but they're, you

know, promoting values of hard work.

And, you know, they're very actually economically dynamic.

Um.

Critical problem here, uh, and you would know this probably

from EH101 already, right, is that spatially this doesn't work

either.

Because the heartland of the Reformation is where?

Where, where are the origins of the Reformation?

Where does it happen?

Where does Luther nail his 99 faeces to the door?

In Germany, right?

Is Germany the first place to industrialise?

It is not.

So that's a problem.

Um.

And the areas that industrialised actually had high levels of

development even before industrialization, right?

So that's a problem.

So all of this together, right, we know about these

Italian city spaces as kind of capitalist hotspots, right?

You know, proto foreign exchange markets, uh, you know, international

banking, trade hubs linking, uh, Western Europe with the Middle

East, etc.

etc.

Um, also, you know, the capitalist network, I mean, we're

trying to define culture and values today, which is difficult.

Defining capitalism is an even more difficult thing, but, uh,

it obviously includes non-Protestants.

Right?

So it's not like capitalist growth only ever happens, uh,

timing wise, uh, after the Reformation, but people have been

doing capitalist things for centuries beforehand, many of them, uh,

well, definitely not Protestants because Protestants hadn't, you know, been

invented yet and not even Christian, right?

So that is another problem.

Um, So, vapour links this Protestant ethic directly to the

rise of capitalism.

Right.

So, as I said, the implications of this kind of

logic are all history is tely logical.

Uh.

Do we need to define teleological.

Have we used this before?

Anybody know what this means?

You go Google it or if you don't need to

Google it, you can just tell me.

OK Well, I think, I think that's like.

3 quarters or, you know, 80% of the way there,

but let's, for consistency's sake, let's, let's do a Google

search.

Of the cause by which they Yeah, yeah, so it's

like, you know, the ends justify the means, etc.

etc.

But basically it's a very teleological argument, um, so basically

the chosen people, in this case Protestants are able to

achieve great things and also there's nothing anybody can do

about it, right?

Uh, those are all the implications of this argument.

Um, it, it, it extends right to say if you

want to take this to it, you know, logical conclusion

is that European supremacy over other over other civilizations is

defined because there's a, you know, uh, cultural superiority, etc.

etc.

um, where he disagrees right with.

His neoclassical almost uh.

Con Uh, is that this doesn't fit very well with

Adam Smith's homo economicus idea, right?

Um, So, The evidence to support this assertion seems poor,

right, because the hots of capitalism, capitalism are actually, you

know.

The Roman Catholic Church, uh, the homeland of the Protestant

Reformation is not the first place to industrialise.

Um, growth rates in non-Protestant parts of Europe were just

as strong, right?

Uh, and all of these things that are the components

of Weber's Protestant ethic, hard work, saving, investing, right, they're

common in many other civilizations, Jewish communities, uh, Chinese culture,

Korean culture, Japanese culture, right?

Uh, so.

Basically, the Protestant work ethic uh does not hold up

to historical scrutiny.

So I presented you with this narrative kind of only

to debunk it.

Um, but then I thought, actually, I should see, you

know, as a historian, I don't take this seriously, and

don't know why.

Um, but I just want to see, does anybody else

take it seriously, so it turns out, um, I mean,

2013, uh, seems relatively recent to me, uh, because I'm

an old man, um, maybe it doesn't seem so recent

to you, but anyway, in, in geologic time it's relatively

recent and actually if you go into fields that are

not too far removed from our own, this is the

Journal of Economic organisation and behaviour, behaviour and organisation.

Uh, they find.

Driven by this relatively inelegant regression, um, that a productant

work ethic does exist, uh, looking at the evidence from

well-being and the effect of unemployment, right?

Uh, They say, OK, look, evidence for the original thesis

is ambiguous, uh, but we should look at how unemployment

affects different groups of people, and they say Protestants are

hurt more by unemployment than people from other denominations are.

Uh, people who even aren't Protestant themselves are hurt more

by unemployment than other people are, um, and this is

all because there's an.

Intrinsic appreciation of work and Protestant societies that doesn't exist

anywhere.

Um, we don't have to go through all of this.

This is just an example.

The main point here is that Even as pre-industrial economic

historians we want to kind of uh debunk this.

Other people still are using this logic, uh, so it

still has some life, right?

In terms of critiquing this actual paper, right, this is

not gonna be on the exam, but if you're interested.

Uh, the flaw I think here in uh this relatively

inelegant regression is that there's no controls for differences in

levels of income between countries, right?

So what's more important, you know, who is going to

feel The effects of unemployment more, a Protestant or a

non-Protestant.

But perhaps maybe what you need to think of is

who is going to be wounded more by unemployment, a

rich person or a poor person, right?

Uh, So that's a problem.

Um, being unemployed is not a huge problem if you

have lots of money in the bank.

Uh, anyway, so, and right, we could go beyond that

article.

So the Protestant work ethic still lives in other places.

OK, uh, time, doing all right, surprisingly.

Anybody have any Protestant work ethic questions?

I know it's a lot to get through in half

a lecture or anything else I could.

So, uh, I want to move on then.

To another case study.

Uh, this I basically Islamic culture in the Middle East,

right?

So the idea is, uh, people argue that there were

certain aspects or ethics or values associated with Protestantism and

those things might be correlated with economic growth, they would

argue even cost.

Uh, so if we look at, you know, we've looked

at one group of, you know, emerging Christians, um, what

scholars have also done is looked at, uh, different religions

and different cultures.

Uh, so the works that loom large here are, uh,

Tim Kan and Jared Rubin, right, um.

And uh Timoran is a, you know, he's an Islamic

Turkish scholar himself, but he's critical, right?

It's basically how Islamic law held back the Middle East,

right?

Uh, Jared Rubin, um, you know, has this very influential

book, which is talking about divergence again, but it's not

between Europe and Asia.

It's about why the West got rich and the Middle

East did not, right?

And all of these things are very, very surprising.

Because the most technically and economically dynamic parts of Eurasia

in the Middle Ages were actually in the Middle East,

right?

You know, once again, um, if you got time to

travel back to the Middle Ages, uh, you know, you

would not be expecting England to be the first place

to industrialise.

It's a backwater, but, you know, there's many, many much

more vibrant places in the Middle East.

Uh, so what you have here.

is a kind of reversal of fortunes, right?

So here we have GDP per capita, uh, relative to

Britain.

Now, um, This is, this is my colleague David slide.

I'll blame him for this because obviously there's no Britain

in the year 1000, right?

Um, so, uh.

But what you're seeing here is that Iraq people are

richer in terms of GDP per capita in the year

1000, um, but once you get to, uh, you know,

the 19th century, England is leading everywhere, uh, Iraq, Egypt,

Turkey, right, um, they've all become poorer relative to England,

right?

Um, and you can look at your population weighted indicators

of economic performance beyond GDP per capita, right?

So here we have Human Development Index.

Health related things like life expectancy at birth, etc.

etc.

and basically what you see is that a lot of

Middle Eastern countries today, uh, have fallen behind the rest

of the world, right?

So that's the kind of empirical basis for this rehearsal

of fortunes question, right?

How which is.

Reversal of fortunes because you have places that we're leading

economically that are no longer leading um and it's ultimately

a question of divergence, right?

Why are some places getting rich and some places falling

behind?

Again, with any divergent story, you're measuring the delta, right?

You're measuring the difference between two places.

It's not always because one place has stayed the same

and England is powered ahead.

I think what's happening here is you're getting a gap

opening up because like Quran would argue that uh the

Middle East is actually falling behind.

So remember that, you know.

Narratives of divergence are always relative, right?

You're only measuring a gap, but it's, it's not always

clear who is steaming ahead and who is falling behind

or both is happening.

Right.

So, but there's an idea here that institutions are important,

right?

Uh, so, And you know, Asimo Johnson and Robinson, right,

recently all three have won a Nobel Prize in economics

for work, uh, in new institutional economics, uh, which you

know is drawing on these ideas surrounding culture quite a

bit, um, and what they argue here, uh, is that

there's an institutional reversal, right.

Uh, in that, you know, Europeans introduce institutions that are

conducive to growth in some places rather than others, it's

kind of a different branch of the same kind of,

uh, argument, right?

So you have Middle East and North Africa, right before

1800, pretty diverse, lots of stuff going on.

Um, but what you can see here is, look, urbanisation,

and again, we've talked about this, it's not a perfect

proxy for economic growth, but sometimes it's the only data

that we have, uh, So, urban population, solid line, urbanisation

rates, dotted line, uh, and basically, look, the Middle East

and North Africa up until the 19th century is ahead

of Europe, right?

Um, in terms of urbanisation rates.

The urban populations are smaller, uh, but, you know, the

proportion of people working in urban centres is, is higher.

So that tells you something, right?

Maybe not everything, but Uh, and then you know you

have.

A range of other factors here so this comes from

Eric Cheney's work, right, and he's talking about uh the

rise and fall of Islamic science and uh is seeing,

you know, what he thinks is a structural break um

here, right?

So basically, you know, as, uh, Europeans are kind of

moving towards, um, in one way the Middle East is

moving in another.

So Uh, book production, right?

Uh, this is kind of the intellectual knowledge channel that

is trying to explain why Western Europe forged ahead of

the Middle East.

You know, knowledge is diffusing, it's being, you know, uh.

What is the word, my vocabulary escapes me, um.

Codified more regularly.

So, for centuries following the spread of Islam, the Middle

East is way ahead of Europe, right?

Um, but the modern economy, you know, was born in

Western Europe and not in the Middle East, right?

The point here from all of the stuff I've shown

you is that the answer can't be a Weber-esque argument

we we've already eliminated, we've already debunked his, you know,

Europe is, uh, superior ethically to China kind of argument,

similar thing.

It's not backwardness, right?

mediaeval Islam has a range of successes, um, and there's

absolutely nothing against progress in the religious doctrine of Islam,

right?

Um, The answer in the literature is much more nuanced

than the Protestant work ethic, right?

And you would expect that from stuff that's being produced

in the 21st century relative to, you know, what what

Weber was doing, but Weber is kind of like hitting

you with a sledgehammer.

Um, the literature in this field that I've been showing

you is, is much more nuanced, uh, but the ideas

that emerge that might explain some of this is about

how religion.

You know, the culture that surrounds it interacts with governments

in the Middle East, right?

Now, the motivation of most rulers is to maintain.

Or expand their power, right?

And that's a universe.

Um, And it requires, you know, especially in the pre-industrial

world, coercion and legitimacy.

In the Middle Ages Uh, both Islamic and Christian rulers

base their claims of legitimacy from religious authorities.

Right?

You know, you have Christians and Islamic, uh, leaders alike,

you know, believing that they were ordained by God to

lead their people, right?

Um, One strand of the literature suggests that after the

Reformation, European rulers on average, stopped basing legitimacy on religion.

Uh, and therefore creates more room for economic interests to

be considered, right?

Uh, the idea being that if the ruling Groups elites

continue to base their legitimacy on uh religion, then there's

not as much, you know, oxygen for people to consider

economic interests, right?

And you end up with a world that policy based

on the narrow interests of kind of military elites.

So what happens here, um.

Some evidence that, you know, urban citizenship with representative councils,

proto-democracy, right?

These emerge in high mediaeval Europe and are pretty unique,

right?

They don't emerge in the Middle East anyway, um.

The early Middle Ages, you have these slave armies, right,

that prevent the emergence of What you might call to

put that in scare quotes creative tension between feudal lords

and rulers, right, which actually means that, uh, religious elite

in Islamic caliphate becomes entrenched right to a degree that

does not happen in Europe.

Another consideration is that the printing press doesn't penetrate the

Middle East until 300 years after its invention.

Now, Arguably it's because clerics didn't want their power to

be undermined, right?

And that's no different to Christian.

Uh, complaints about what the printing press would do.

One of the things that gives rise to Protestantism in

the first place is Catholics hold on to this idea

that the gospels should be interpreted by clerics, read in

Latin, and mediated, uh, only by them, uh, whereas once

you have the printing press, the Protestants believe.

You know, the Bible should be printed in the vernacular

language, uh, whatever locality, and anybody should be able to

read it.

Um.

I mean, I think there's some nuance to this in

that one of the reasons that uh Printing press and

especially like reprinted reproductions of the Quran don't spread as

widely as because there's a bit of cultural capital.

You know, the prestige of having a handwritten Koran on

expensive paper versus a cheaper printed one.

So there's there's a layer of nuance here that probably

isn't appreciated by an argument that says this is just

because clerics didn't want the power undermined, although that is

probably part of it.

Um, but the main point here is that So the

argument goes in the Middle East, uh, states have no

incentive to overrule these clerics because their legitimacy is still

based on religion.

They need them to stay in power, uh, and therefore,

you know, they uh uh listen to their complaints and

uphold them.

Um, So Northern Europe, the idea is the break from

the church needs to arise in parliaments, you know, again,

proto-democracy, uh, it doesn't happen in Islamic Spain to the

same degree, right?

And the Spanish growth is comparatively slower, um, although the

Spanish case is complicated itself because there's much more political

fragmentation.

Uh, right.

There's also ideas here about um the effect of religion

on trust.

Right?

What you end up with, uh, you know, in research

like this, uh, is that certain religions seem to be

Uh, more trusting than others.

I'm not really sure what to make of this.

I just thought I would throw it in, um, because,

uh, it seems to be another variable that we need

to consider.

Um, I mean we return here to questions of trade

and the fundamental problem of exchange, right?

Uh, and if you go back to Gre's article about

his proposed solution to the fundamental problem of exchange that

differentiated.

Uh, these McGreevy traders, uh, which are a distinct cultural

group from the merchants from Genoa, uh, is that, you

know, they have a collectivist culture based on personal exchange,

informal institutions, you know, much more trust, right, whereas the

people from Genoa are require formal structures to make sure

that nobody reneges on trade.

Um, right, so.

Where this all ends up, uh, is that Tu Quran

will say that, uh, social norms prevent questioning of inefficiencies,

uh, and pre-modern Middle East, right?

It's not, you know, it's definitely kind of cut from

the same cloth as Max Weber's take on Catholicism, right?

But returning to where we started, note the mechanism here.

These are arguments about how culture shapes individual behaviour, individual

decision making.

Um, Quran's argument.

Basically is about how culture shapes law and the law

intermediates the possibilities for economic growth, right?

So you're looking specifically at the kind of contract where

you have a sedentary investor and a roving merchant, right,

um, but you see some difference in the formal structures

that emerge in Europe versus in the Middle East, uh,

as we've talked about in previous lectures, you get business

organisations.

Establishing themselves in 13th century Europe, um, and it definitely

grows into the 16th century joint stock companies, right, like

the East India Company.

Um, but at this point in time, there's stagnation in

the Islamic world.

What Quran argues is that Islamic law is too egalitarian.

Um, they have particable inheritance split between all of the

family members, meaning you can't accumulate capital, um, and their

form of contract, uh.

is too rigid.

That's Quran's thesis, right?

Um, whereas in mediaeval Europe, you actually have very, very

flexible, uh, financial instruments and forms of contract, you know,

like the bill of exchange that we've talked about already,

um.

Very negotiable, right?

Uh, the rights, uh, of these financial instruments are upheld

in commercial court.

So the idea, the idea here that Quran is advancing

is that perhaps there's more flexibility in, you know, the.

Governance of mediaeval Europe that is no longer, you know,

kind of based on religious legitimacy and there you end

up with more degrees of economic freedom and that correlates

into growth in Europe and not in the Middle East

and obviously we've talked about this before, but you know

the bill of exchange ends up you know being a

very, very powerful instrument, although only one example.

Um, and Islam didn't, did have something similar, right?

So again, we have to be cautious here not to

draw a binary distinction in that, OK, Europe develops complex

financial instruments that are integral to its growth, uh.

Islam had, uh, Islamic parts of the world had.

Their own instruments, right, um, but they only involve three

parties, right, where the bill of exchange is kind of

endlessly, um, it could be expandable, right?

Uh, and they are paying this, you know, in the

same currency whereas the bill of exchange allows you to

deal with multiple currencies, um, and the bigger thing here

is it's only employed in personal network.

And that limits the scope right?

because the bill of exchange can be used, you know,

anonymously uh across networks where nobody knows anybody because people

are confident that uh its terms will be upheld, right?

So this is where Ruben goes and says, look, um,

Islam is what he calls a high dependence system where

Western Christianity is a low dependent system.

Uh, so, in Islam, right, uh, You know, guaranteed interest

is never permitted, uh, at least formally profit isn't permitted.

You can't exploit differences in exchange rate in the like

FX market which Christians could do.

Only borrowers can profit, um, and the form of contract

is relegated to facilitating trade only and it's confined to

personal networks.

In Western Europe, um, right, lenders are permitted to profit,

uh, and can benefit from arbitrage and exchange rates.

It's interregional and impersonal, so it's a much more effective,

uh, mechanism, right?

So again, it's not this isn't something that is uh

Christians have a.

Western European Christians have.

You know, sophisticated financial system and the Middle East does

not, it's just that there was perhaps, uh, according to

Ruben, uh, an advantage in the system that emerged, uh,

in Western European Christianity relative to Islam.

Um, So Another, you know, problem with this, remember we

put out the Weber thesis, which, you know, before we

start considering the um critiques, actually sounds quite persuasive.

Uh, the difference between the literature about the Protestant work

ethic and these things comparing, uh, culture, values, institutions in

the Islamic Middle East and, uh, Western Europe is that

you've had 100 years or more for critiques to emerge,

whereas most of this stuff that actually started to compare

uh institutions in the Middle East and um.

Europe for the pre-industrial period is only decades old, if

that, right?

So we want to check in again 100 years from

now to see where we are, but the point I

wanted to show you, uh, is that this idea that.

Middle Eastern uh rulers derived their legitimacy from religious elites,

uh, long after Christians had kind of rationally abandoned that.

That actually might not hold up to scrutiny, right?

Um, it might not be so binary, uh, because here

we have an 18th century, uh, Italian commentator.

Um, who's basically saying that European rulers are deriving their,

uh, legitimacy from religious sources already, right?

Um, The other thing, you know, about the bill of

exchange argument is that interest rates.

Right, are permitted, uh, at least.

More formally in the European situation, right?

So the idea would be that Europeans have a financial

instrument that allows them to easily charge interest.

Benefit from that creates effective markets whereas the Islamic doctrine

in Middle East uh does not permit the charging of

interest, therefore it has to be kind of built in

through backdoors and it's not just an efficient of a

mechanism.

But there's also research from John Monroe that says, look,

um, we might be overplaying this idea that restrictions of

charging interest was stopped in Europe in the 13th century,

right?

Um, Because actually, you know, because Christians had their own

ban on this, uh, which the literature has kind of

assumed disappeared in the 13th century, but actually if you

look closely, that does not seem to be the case.

So the point here is that The critiques are starting

to emerge, right?

So we might, in 100 years get to the same

place, you know, in our case study of the Middle

East relative to Western Europe.

Um, and we're kind of running out of time here,

but there's a whole other case that you could do,

uh, about, you know, the culture and values of Confucianism,

right, uh, and, and, and the religions of Taoism and

Buddhism and how they differ from European values, right?

Same set of questions.

Did this shape economic behaviour and therefore economic outcomes?

And how have our perceptions changed over time of these

differences, right?

Weber, uh, makes the same kind of move, uh, this

is expanding on where we started about the value system

here, right?

He said, OK, Confucians don't have the capitalist values that

Protestants have, right?

Um.

That's another case study, you know, for another day.

Uh, so to conclude, right.

Culture is clearly linked to economic performance.

Right, we can't escape that.

It must have an impact.

This is, you know, if you take culture and put

it through the into the language of new institutional economics,

these are simply the rules of the game, right?

And the rules of the game change depending on time

and place.

If you're reading the news at all, the rules of

the game, you know, are changing under our very feet

right now and very quickly if you are living in

America.

Right?

Um, so culture is, uh, important.

Many grand theories about this and many empirical critiques, right?

The reformation is not the economic watershed that Weber thought

it was, uh, it's completely wrong about China, right?

But also values and perceptions, right, they change over time.

Um, As I said, like very quickly in America at

the moment, uh, so is there a correlation between cultural

features and economic growth?

Probably, but very, very heavily contextually dependent and very difficult

to unpick causality.

Thank you.

You're waiting for me to say something boring about the

syllabus, but I'll wait for next week for that.

Already Yeah.

Shall we do it?

Wow Yeah, I.

I think Actually OK, it's like waiting.

I feel like Question.

In the middle Is it possible to get this.

OK, yeah, and then I'll send.

Did you attend the TCN friends one session last week?

No, OK, I don't think so.

Yeah, no worries.

I'll last week.

OK, I can email you worries thank you.

What LS still working on the edge Yeah.

And he's basically getting.

like It Hello.

No.

OK.

Yes.

Tess.

To

Lecture 17:

Nick brought his own water to this thing.

Did, did you put the slides on already?

Uh, yes, great.

There might still be coffee and tea as well, so

if if the these are all clean, so thank you

so much.

I could probably use some yeah please.

I thought you All right.

OK.

Sounds good.

Uh, I want a cookie cracker.

Um, yeah, as long as it's easy.

I'm gonna have to ask you at some point an

embarrassing latex question, uh, because like you kindly sent me

your very nice latex model, but just like one thing

that I just can't make work.

What is it?

um.

Uh, I think it's like the something in the preamble,

uh, seems to get started.

Anyway, I'll bother you about it at some point.

Hey Greg, how's it going?

I went with your song.

What was that?

Taxman?

Oh right, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I've actually put both

of them up and we'll let the students decide, uh,

which is, well, I'm not gonna play mine, but I

had, I thought the law by Dequash, which I thought

that's a good one.

Um, man, I did a, um, I did the 390

workshop in here.

And the two halves of the class drove me insane.

Like trying to talk Two halves at the same time

would just drive me nuts.

I would, uh.

We were being recorded now.

Oh.

It's a weird room.

It's a bit like a panopticon.

Who am I talking to?

So somebody's always looking at the back of your head.

Yeah.

Uh Uh This is you then?

No, no, I should be down farther.

OK.

Ah, there we go.

Where are we?

1402.

OK, uh.

Yeah.

Mhm.

Yeah Are you gonna introduce me or am I just

on my own?

No, no, I'm going to introduce you.

I'll go sit down.

Guys, if anybody wants to graze.

wants to graze on the leftovers from the catering, please

do get a coffee or something.

Yeah.

Yeah.

Singing a song.

All right.

So, I mean it's taken us to almost the end

of the year to arrive at the Beatles song for

song of the week, which seemed kind of slightly surprising.

Um, This was Nick, choice, uh, Greg.

I have my own contender, which I'll let you discover

if you want.

And you can tell me, uh, who has better taste.

Um, anyway, uh, it's my pleasure to introduce, uh, Nick,

who at least some of you will know.

Um, uh, Nick is working on a PhD in the

development of the early modern economy, uh, and he's kindly

chipped in to do some class teaching, uh, to get

us through to the end of the year, and he

is going to, uh, speak to us about state formation.

So come on up.

All right.

Hi, everybody.

Uh, I'm Nick, and this is my first ever lecture,

so bear with me, and if you don't understand anything,

please raise your hand and, uh, I'll take questions throughout

if you don't understand anything.

Uh, so to get started, here's what we're gonna talk

about.

First, what is a state and why do we care

about states?

Second, we're gonna go back to the origins.

Feudalism because the feudal state is what the modern state

really grew out of then we're gonna talk about the

development of that modern state, do a little comparison between

Europe and China because the, the state took really different

forms in both of these places and then finally we're

gonna talk about what are the effects of the creation

of the modern state once you create this huge amount

of power concentrated in the central state, what does it

tend to do, um.

So first, uh, this used to be numbered 1 through

4, not sure why it isn't anymore.

Um.

Number one, why do we care about states.

States are the most powerful institutions in the world.

Um, they, they have been for a long time and

they continue to be today.

The only people who could choose to say launch a

war that would end most life on Earth are the

leaders of states, so they continue to be basically the

world's most important institutions.

Second, there's a really strong correlation between sort of limited

states, constrained and open states, and sustained growth in the

modern period.

So we want to see how those states came about.

Um, third, state-led actions are some of the only things

that can move an entire economy toward greater growth or

immediate decline simply based on the decision of that institution.

And then finally, uh, they're everywhere now.

Every basically every habitable bit of the earth is covered

in.

A territorial state with a single national government that claims

sovereignty over that territory, and they even have a special

flag and a special song.

They're patterned on the European state that developed during this

period.

So this is the roots of our modern, uh, the

state system that we still have today.

Um, so first off, definitions.

What is a state?

The classic definition is Max Weber.

It's a compulsory political organisation with continuous operations, and it'll

be called a state insofar as its administrative staff successfully

upholds its claim to the monopoly of the legitimate use

of physical force in the enforcement of its order.

Shorter version, monopoly on legitimate violence.

The main problem with this definition is the idea of

legitimacy.

It's a very slippery term.

Charles Tilly defines legitimacy as the probability that other authorities

will act to confirm the decisions of a given authority.

Um, so I think Tilly's definition is a little better.

His is coercion wielding institutions that are distinct from households

and kinship groups.

That exercise clear priority in some respects over all other

organisations within substantial territories.

So, within a given territory, they're the most important coercive

institution and they exercise clear priority over all the other

ones.

Um.

So this is a little bit before the period of

this class.

Uh, this is France in about 987.

So you can see if I can figure out the

laser pointer up here.

The only things that the king directly owns are these

little tiny bits up at the top here.

Everything else is owned by another person capable of deploying

their own private force.

So this we'd probably not refer to as a state,

but By the end of the 17th century under Louis

the 14th, we have a large contiguous single national state

under a single king, mostly following a single set of

laws with a monopoly on force.

So this we would definitely call a modern state.

Um, here's the leader of that modern state.

Does anybody know what's what's his most famous line?

What's the most famous quote from Louis the 14th?

Anybody?

Craig, you know, yeah, uh, Letasemoi, I am the state,

um.

Unfortunately, he never said that.

What he actually said was, I am leaving, but the

state will always remain.

So he's talking about the state as essentially an immortal

separate being from the king himself that will continue long

after any given ruler has bit the dust.

And this is what we're going to talk about today

is the development of the state as an entity that

is separate from the monarch and that is an immortal

institution with power over a given area.

Uh, so to get there, we have to go back

to the origins of feudalism.

Um, this comes right after the collapse of the Roman

Empire.

So, Right after the Roman Empire collapses, we have invasions

from a lot of different people.

So these are the Vikings.

This is, I think this is supposed to be the

raid on Lindisfarne, a monastery up in um up in

the north of England.

This is a French painting of the Battle of Tours,

so, a, uh, Muslim raiding party was stopped, uh, basically

a little ways outside of Paris in a long raid

into the interior of France.

And then this is a painting or an etching of

a Magyar horse archer from Italy, um.

So these are the three main groups of raiders that

were attacking Europe at this time and creating a situation

of anarchy and huge physical insecurity in almost all of

Europe.

Um, so here are their primary routes.

So you can see basically anywhere you have a river

or you touch the ocean, you're subject to a Viking

raid.

Uh, the Magyars came out of the Hungarian, the Carpathian

basin, and basically raided all the way into France, all

the way down into Italy.

Um, And the, the Muslim invasions largely came up into

Southern Europe through here.

So there were a lot of raiders, a lot of

invasions into Europe during this period.

Um, and primarily these were raids.

So these weren't attempts at conquest.

These were an effort to carry off movable valuables and

human beings to be sold into slavery.

So they came in small groups.

They struck very fast, so the Muslims in Magyars came

on horseback.

The Vikings came in long boats that could go way,

way up a river, you know, they even attacked Paris

as far as it is from the coast.

It's on a river, so it was vulnerable to Viking

attack, and they're bad at sieges, which is very convenient

for local rulers in Europe.

So.

The targets were usually these rich areas far from central

power, although in the case of Paris, sometimes they did

strike at richer areas, but usually their prime targets were

things like monasteries.

They're located way away from central power and they're extraordinarily

rich, and the response from local rulers in Europe.

was to build fortifications, eventually castles.

This is an early castle and build up their own

localised militaries.

So instead of waiting on the central government, because if

you can see a lot of these raids, if you're

up at Lindisfarne, there's no way that the central government

in London is ever going to make it before the

Vikings leave.

So you need a local power holder, you need local

armed men, you need to be able to respond very,

very fast to potential raids.

Uh, and this brings us to the first of the

required readings for this week.

Um, this is Volckert's kind of simple economic model for

how you get the development of feudalism and later the

transition to the modern state.

Uh, so in anarchy, the situation that we have after

the Roman Empire with no firm government, um, roving bands

of armed men, the only people with property rights are

the people who can claim them and defend them.

Uh, so this creates extreme physical insecurity for most people

who are not soldiers.

Uh, second, information and other transaction costs are really high.

The, the physical danger, the lack of infrastructure, uh, this

all makes it so it's very difficult to even hear

about invasions in time to come and meet them.

It's difficult to check and see if your underlings are

actually going to show up when you need them to

show up.

Um, so it's very difficult to, to create a large

security apparatus.

So this also pushes toward localised provision of security, um.

Next, the labour to land ratio is really low.

This is really nice for peasants.

Peasants are put in a very surprisingly good negotiating position

because the thing that aspiring lords need more than anything

is labour to work on their farms.

So the result of this is that powerful actors can

benefit quite a bit by protecting weaker people, particularly agriculturalists

and peasants, um, in exchange for tribute in money or

labour.

And the weaker actors benefit from the protection of these

local lords.

They don't want their goods carried off by Vikings any

more than the lords do, um.

And so in this, we kind of have, if you

remember back to the agriculture week, you have the building

blocks of the manorial system.

You have a lord providing protection, you have peasants providing

labour or cash rents.

Um, And the system got further articulated because obviously if

you're just a small local lord, you may also be

vulnerable yourself.

So the main thing that you do is you take

your little retinue of armed men and you choose an

even bigger lord and you band together for protection that

way.

um.

So vassals would, they actually had a huge amount of

choice early in the period.

This would disappear later on, but early in the period,

if you were, if you controlled a group of armed

men, you could really choose who you wanted to contract

with and who you wanted your lord to be.

So you had some negotiating power just like the peasants

did.

The The lords were not particularly powerful during this period.

Um, and so these kind of intermediate lords concluded contracts

with lords that were higher up in the hierarchy.

And like I said earlier, the high costs of control,

the high information costs meant that there is no clear

priority or monopoly of force.

People are legally allowed and able to deploy their own

private military forces, even if they nominally are pledging fealty

to the king.

So there's no monopoly of force and therefore we can

say no state, at least in the modern sense.

And so this is the basic structure you get, um,

in the, the, um, in the mediaeval period.

So right at the bottom, this sort of bottom link

you'd call the manorial system.

This is peasants who are pledged to lower level lords,

um, and then you have lords pledged to higher lords,

and then you have one single lord, obviously at the

peak of this pyramid shaped organisation because he's at the

peak, we give him a special name, we give him

a special hat, and that's the king.

So the condition during the early mediaeval era.

The protection market is characterised by 5 main factors.

There's uncertainty about the future.

Attacks could come from almost anywhere and at almost any

time.

Information asymmetries between uh partners contracting for security are pretty

serious.

It's very tough to monitor what your subordinate lords are

doing.

It's very tough to ensure that they'll even show up

when you call them up unless they have an interest

in doing so.

Third, um, your partners are often almost equally powerful.

A little later on we'll talk about the baron's war.

Uh, frequently lower level lords could band together and overthrow

higher level lords.

Uh, 4th.

Pretty easy to substitute for the protection provided by different

lords.

So there are actual, there's a lot of examples of

peasants being lured away from one lord to go serve

another lord, a lot of vassals of one lord being

lured away to serve a different lord.

So there were low exit costs.

It was genuinely possible to choose which lord you wanted

to serve, and this is part of how you get

those really fragmented, um.

Really weird looking borders in the mediaeval era is by

people choosing to uh to serve a lord that's not

even particularly nearby, uh, because they're getting a better deal.

And then finally, uh, you can't really monitor the the

actions of your lower ranking partners very well and so

this gives them quite a bit of autonomy.

So information costs.

Uh, which are kind of the centre of Volcker's model

here, really affects points 24, and 5, and they keep

the scale of protection and the provision of protection very

small.

So you get local lords ruling small areas providing protection

to the people nearby.

Uh, but this starts to change with the development of

the modern state.

So first we have military changes.

The Vikings and the Magyars kind of settle down, become

Christian kingdoms of their own, and start building their own

sort of proto-states, and they stop raiding nearly so much.

Um, the Muslims are pushed out of Iberia.

And their focus sort of shifts more to the Mediterranean

and the Balkans.

So the place we're talking about, Northwest Europe, is no

longer really under threat from this kind of raiding.

Now their main threat comes from their neighbouring European powers.

We also get shifts in military technology, so cannons can

now knock down castles very effectively.

Um, Pike and shot defeats knights very effectively.

And this makes armies really expensive and very logistics intensive

and it makes them a lot slower.

So it's a lot easier to figure out if you're

being invaded, call up your army and meet the opposing

army in the field.

Uh, and we covered, I think we covered a lot

of this in the military revolution, um, topic, and all

of these changes push toward greater centralization of power and

economies of scale in the provision of military protection.

Um, and with this, with this increase in expense and

the centralization of military power, uh, total revenue becomes a

lot more decisive in deciding the outcome of military contests.

And we also have a lot of economic changes during

this period because of the security that was provided by

all these local lords with their local military forces, we

start to get things like population growth, urbanisation, increased trade.

We see some agricultural innovations.

You see people.

Essentially reaching out and building economies that spread out from

just their local farms.

You see longer distance trade, you see financialization, you see

more coinage flowing through European economies, and you see much

easier and better information flows.

With more trade, always flows more information, and it flows

faster.

And so this pushes all of these information costs down.

So returning to Volkert's model.

Uh, when you have lower information costs, it's easier to

meet threats from a central point when they come.

If you find out that you're being invaded, it's much

easier to actually muster the national army and go out

and meet them because, um, you can hear about it

faster and they're not going to immediately leave because they're

raiding you.

Um, second, you can monitor your inferiors a lot easier.

It's a lot easier to tell what your inferiors in

the military organisation are doing.

And this again pushes toward a larger military organisation.

Um, second, we have lower transaction costs across the board.

So basically doing trade is easier, doing trade is cheaper,

uh, physical security is one of those things that massively

decreases transaction costs by keeping you safe while you're trading.

So this increases trade and increases the surplus available to

rulers that they might want to redistribute.

Uh, 3rd, higher population substantially weakens the position of peasants.

At the start of the period, peasants were a hot

commodity.

They were in high demand because it was tough to

find people to work on your land.

And during this period, we see population.

Pushing to basically it's natural limited plateauing, and this really,

really weakens the bargaining position of any given peasant because

they're always replaceable.

The more replaceable they are, the the weaker their bargaining

position is.

And there's not nearly so much free land that they

can just go off and live on, um, which pushes

their exit cost very, very high.

So all of these factors result in kings redistributing surplus

to their vassals in exchange for the centralization of coercive

power.

I think the example that Volker uses is the King

of Prussia, basically, um, he gives his nobles huge economic

privileges.

Making their peasants sell grain at their own local markets

that they can then sell on at a profit at

larger markets, so they give surplus to their vassals in

the form of economic monopolies in exchange for centralising coercive

power and turning a bunch of individual local armies into

a large national army.

Um, and I guess the other the other thing pushing

toward economies of scale is just a very simple fact

that it's easier to defend your borders if you're a

larger country.

So if you have 4 people and you have 8

units of border, each person has to finance 2 border

units.

In a larger country, each inhabitant only has to finance

1 unit of the border, and as the area of

a state continues to grow.

The border length will increase linearly.

The land area increases quadratically.

This is a point from being one of the supplementary

readings that in the absence of forces that would tend

to push toward decentralisation of coercive institutions, we should expect

to see this kind of process, this kind of gathering

of lands under the hand of a single state or

a single ruler, um, proceeding basically on its own.

So for some examples of state formation, uh, England is

relatively early to the game of state formation.

Um, they have a, they have better infrastructure.

They have a lot of navigable rivers, they have a

huge coastline.

So it's relatively easy.

Oh, and they have a high literacy rate, so it's

relatively easy to get information around the kingdom of England.

Um.

In addition, due to their geography, they have much higher

exit costs, whereas lords in Germany could just sort of

shuffle a little bit to the east and take some

peasants with them.

In England, there's really there's not much of a place

to go.

Um, so all, all other things being equal, the power

of rulers is positively correlated with exit costs.

You can extract more from people if they can't leave

and negatively correlated with information costs.

You can't get as much from people if you can't

monitor them effectively.

Uh, so with high exit costs, low information costs, England

has an effective monopoly of force by the 12th century.

Uh, there's not a lot of private, uh, violent organisations,

and so there are fewer monopolies that are created on

local economic markets by those private violent organisations, and this

helps promote economic development in England.

There's actually one part of England that is kind of

the exception that proves the rule here.

It's the Scottish border.

The.

Nobles at the Scottish border retain a huge amount of

autonomy and they retain a lot of their own military

forces because like in earlier periods, they're under threat of

raids.

So the raids come from Scotland, so the people need

on the ground military forces right there to respond and

so they hold on to their local military forces a

lot longer than anybody else in England, um, which I

think shows that the Volker's model is um is broadly

applicable even in England, um.

The next example of state formation is a little later

and it's in France.

So the 100 Years' War, um, creates an extreme lack

of security.

The main threat is the English army, um, and the

interests of French towns and their kings start to overlap.

The towns need security, and they need the kind of

security that a centralised army can provide.

But to provide that, the king needs taxes, um, and

the king needs these these armies are getting much, much

more expensive.

Uh, so the king needs taxes, and he offers regular

and predictable taxation rather than arbitrary and capricious taxation.

standardise standardises weights and measures, something that we'll talk about

a little later, but is a huge driver of trade,

and most of all, the towns need security.

And so they make this trade, taxes for security and

predictability and The king uses these urban taxes to start

buying off the nobility, giving them economic privileges, and buying

them out of the security market, centralising the army under

the French king and creating this monopoly on the use

of force.

Um, so the next part of this is the fiscal

development of the state.

This is, this is maybe one of the most important

parts of state formation because it's all well and good

to need a centralised military force to defend yourself, but

it's amazingly expensive and mediaeval ways of fun.

Armies simply were not capable of sustaining these early modern

armies that they needed to defend themselves.

So the, the way that mediaeval states finance themselves was

called, um, they were called a domain state.

So the kings were expected to live off land that

they directly owned.

So this is France in 10:30, uh, just this little

blue bit is what the king directly owned.

And he is expected to police and defend to some

extent this entire area.

So with such a small income, it's not really possible

to defend this entire area, which is why you see

the division of security responsibilities up into all these little

different areas.

Um, taxes were basically only permitted for extraordinary expenditures, so

as soon as you got into a war.

You were allowed to start raising taxes, but before that

it was generally not permitted, uh, and the way that

this was enforced is through rebellion.

There was no other option.

The the king was not legally constrained.

The king was constrained by the threat of rebellion of

these powerful nobles who held military forces that when combined,

uh, could probably overwhelm the king.

Um, later on, Uh, due to some of these rebellions,

uh, states developed representative institutions, um, and obviously the most

famous one.

Is Westminster, the parliament of the United Kingdom, um.

With this shift, we see the shift to a fiscal

state rather than a domain state.

So, the king is no longer expected to fund all

of his expenses from his own land.

We get the regularisation of taxes.

So, taxes are now um They're approved by these representative

institutions, so the King of England needs to ask Parliament,

so he asks the nobles are the ones serving in

Parliament, so they still have a voice.

It's just not through rebellion.

So the nobles have to vote to approve these taxes,

and taxes become much more regularised.

Uh, maybe even more important though is that the wealth

of the emerging capitalist class can now be tapped through

new financial instruments.

So instead of waiting for a war to be declared

and then panicking and suddenly levying a giant amount of

taxes, when war is declared, you borrow a huge amount

of money, then you use your regular taxes to pay

it off over a long period of time.

So fundamentally, financial instruments are tools for turning sudden expenses.

Sudden and unpredictable expenses into long term very predictable expenses

that you can pay off over time and that's, that's

what allows the fiscal state to develop is the ability

to borrow from your emerging capitalist class um and I

don't know, have you had them read uh North.

A credible commitment Um, I don't think it's an essential

reading.

It is in the reading list, and we can update

it to the.

This OK, cool, um, so basically this is, this is

a huge uh emphasis in the new institutional economics and

in the, uh, institutional economic history this phrase credibly committed.

Basically the idea is that kings had a tough time

borrowing money because if you loan money to a king,

you never know if the king is just going to

turn around until you get bent and just not pay

it.

Uh, this happened a lot.

Uh, this was part of the reason that, um, some

English kings used Jewish financiers, is because if they ever

couldn't pay off the money, they could turn around and

say, These Jews are trying to take what we have.

They killed Jesus and expel them from the kingdom and

thus liquidate their debts.

So it's really dangerous to lend to a king.

Um, but if a king is constrained by parliament and

parliament has to approve the budget of the king, then

lenders can be more sure that the money is gonna

be spent responsibly, it's not going to be wasted, and

it will be paid back on time.

And so this allowed the King of England to borrow

at much, much lower interest rates than people like the

King of France.

Um, probably worth noting here Donald Trump's questioning as to

whether America needs to repay all of his debts.

we're returning to a credible commitment.

Yeah, so every time you say, wow, do we really

need to pay back our debts, the interest rates just

creep up a little higher because that's the main threat.

If you can't make somebody pay back their debts, you're

going to need to charge them more over time.

Um, on the off chance that they just decide they

don't need to pay him.

Uh, so here we can see the activity of parliament.

So in Southern Europe, um, Spain, France, and Portugal, you

can see they, they do have active parliaments, but then

they sort of, uh, they sort of fall off as

absolutism, the centralization of power in only the king becomes

more prominent.

And then the Northwestern European states, you see a much,

much more active parliament because parliament is actively constraining the

uh the fiscal actions of rulers, but ironically, this constraint

of the fiscal actions of rulers mean that the rulers

can actually borrow more.

That's the essence of credible commitment is if you.

Have somebody who can force you to pay back your

debt, you can borrow for less.

This is why unsecured loans like payday loans, they have

interest of 20-30%, secured loans like mortgages, um, I think

they said at like 5% or something like that.

Um.

The ability to force somebody to pay back debts is

really essential here, and it's crucial to to England's uh.

Um, successful finance for the next few 100 years.

Uh, here's our log tax revenues for 5 European powers,

um, and you can see, because this is a log

scale, this what looks like a slight lead for England

up here is actually a pretty giant lead.

So England is pulling in way, way more tax revenue

because they have this constrained monarch and they have a

regularised budget.

And further on the fiscal development of the state, you

can actually, you can basically see in the trends in

tax revenue who's about to have a really bad 19th

century and who's not.

So if you look at the Ottomans, if you look

at Venice, if you look especially at Poland, Lithuania, uh,

you can see states that are not improving their fiscal

capacity, they're not keeping up with these new military developments,

um.

In the case of Poland and Lithuania, they haven't even

centralised their coercive apparatus.

They don't meaningfully have a modern state, and at least

for Poland, they're about to be Uh, they're about to

be removed from the European map, and the Ottomans are

going to enter a long, slow decline while the states

that are rapidly increasing, like England and France, are about

to become the dominant powers in the 19th century.

So this, the fiscal state, I think, is really at

the heart of what makes modern states more effective than

pre-modern states.

Uh, finally, I didn't know where else to put this,

but this is a really important concept.

Um, this is from the other reading Sprout.

Uh, he talks about sovereignty.

So in the early mediaeval period, there's no concept of

sovereignty.

Um, there's no idea that the king of a given

area is the single legitimate authority of that area and

the single point of contact for outsiders who want to,

um, want to make treaties with a state.

Authority is divided internally between the king and his nobles,

and the Pope has a pretty serious claim to be

able to tell even a king's subjects what to do.

So this is symbolised, this is from much later than

this actual event, but this is the Pope crowning Charlemagne,

an extraordinarily powerful Christian emperor.

But this symbolises the role.

That the Pope had a sort of sitting over the

top of the king and having a sort of dual

sovereignty and some claim on the loyalty even of the

king's own citizens.

Um, and this led to a a not particularly sharp

distinction between internal and external affairs.

Um, contrast this with the crowning of a different emperor.

This is Napoleon.

Uh, when the Pope went to crown him, he grabbed

the crown from the Pope and put it on his

own head, symbolising that He is sovereign.

He's the king.

There's no one above him.

He's not getting his authority from the pope.

He is the leader of the French state, and it's

not by the grace of the pope.

It's simply because he's the leader of a sovereign state.

So this concept of sovereignty is really articulated in Hobbs's

Leviathan, um.

So this, this guy composed of all the little people,

it doesn't symbolise the king, it symbolises the state itself.

And the king is essentially the representative of the state,

which is sort of, he calls it an artificial man

composed of all of the people of the country.

And the king represents it like a lawyer would represent

you in court.

Um, but this idea is that the.

The state itself is sovereign and that the, the king

is the representative of that sovereign state.

Um, sovereignty also means that the ruler is the dominant

domestic authority.

It's the, the ruler is the final arbiter of all

domestic conflicts.

Uh, the sovereign is also the single point of contact

with other states.

Um, so again, from the Sprout reading.

Part of the problem with things like city state leagues

is that there's no single point of contact.

There's no one who can say I speak for all

the people of this state.

I'm the king of France, I speak for all of

the French.

And finally, um, the Treaty of Westphalia establishes a norm

often violated, uh, still often violated, uh, against the interference

in the domestic affairs of other states, a clear division

between domestic and international affairs.

Uh, so now let's move on to contrast the state

in Europe and China, because China has a very different

history of state development.

Um, first, let's review what is a state.

It's a coercive institution with priority over all the other

coercive institutions inside a defined territory.

A sovereign is a ruler who's autonomous inside its borders

and independent beyond them.

And so You have two different types of constraints on

your state.

So for for pre-modern states, the king is not all

powerful, but the way his power is constrained is by

other people with armed men who can tell the king

to take a hike, and if the king does something

bad enough, they can overthrow him.

Um, the risk is rebellion or exit.

So someone will either overthrow you or pledge their loyalty

to a neighbouring king.

Um, and reduce your power.

The modern and limited state is really different.

It's also constrained, but it's constrained by the rule of

law, and it's constrained by the fact that the king

has to ask representative institutions to approve any budget, any

taxation, any borrowing.

Do you mind turning that uh mic off?

And it's important to recognise that states take a tonne

of different forms.

So here we have two, these are two states.

This is the Ottoman Empire, and this is the Venetian

Staodamar, state of the sea.

Uh, they couldn't be more different.

So one is a giant contiguous land empire, mostly agrarian,

ruled by a virtually absolute monarch.

Their military is a set of slave soldiers, um, and

they're, they're very bureaucratic.

The Venetians, it's an aristocratic republic, uh, non-contiguous, only connected

by sea lanes.

Um, the soldiers are mostly mercenaries, but both of these

fundamentally are two different types of states.

So the performance of these two states, um, can be

explained by a lot of different variables like their physical

contiguity, their size, their cultural and linguistic homogeneity, um.

Whether or not their jurisdiction and law is fragmented and

the constraints on their rulers.

So, it's important to recognise states can take a tonne

of different forms in response to their local conditions.

Um.

So to contrast states at either end of Eurasia, um,

in Europe, states kind of slowly re-emerge after the Roman

Empire collapses.

We have a stateless period after the collapse of the

Roman Empire, and then from there we get states essentially

gobbling each other up until there's just a few states

left.

There's a little bit of fragmentation, but from 1500, there's

a lot of consolidation, and most of Europe's expansion takes

place outward into the rest of the non-European world.

Uh, China is really different.

China goes through periods of fragmentation, but then always tends

to reunite at the end of them.

Um, The core empire is reestablished over and over again,

and a lot of these dynastic transitions take place when

a foreign power invades, but they don't invade to end

the old order.

Usually they invade because the old order has gotten corrupt

and they claim to be restorers of the empire.

And so it's a fundamentally different situation in China and

Europe with the development of the state.

And the um the Chinese state, each iteration tends to

have slightly different borders, but broadly they tend to keep

getting a little bigger each time, um.

By the time China is fighting the Opium War with

the British, it's basically it's largest extent ever.

It's pushed into Central Asia and is, um, yeah, it's

larger than it's ever been.

So here's European political boundaries.

You can see the breakup of the Roman Empire, um.

Oh, I think, sorry, this is 500, this is 1000,

um, and you can see the extremely fragmented Central Europe,

and you can gradually see a lot of these states.

Again, this is supposed to be 1800, this is supposed

to be 1900.

You can see the small states basically getting swallowed up

by the larger states, um, but there's no re-emergence of

a massive empire.

Uh, in China.

It's really different.

You see basically the same core areas forming the Chinese

Empire each time with just a little bit of expansion,

you know, the, the Qing Manchus came from here, so

we've added this, um, but it's basically the same core

state each time.

Um.

In Europe, states are monarchical, so led by kings.

Kings see other kings as equal.

Whereas in China, the Chinese model of diplomacy is that

there is no other emperor, that there's no, there's no

equal to the emperor.

Relations are of domination and tribute, not of.

Equals, um, in Europe you get the feudal organisation that

we talked about earlier moving through aristocratic and finally I

think we still live in a bureaucratic era whereas China

established its bureaucracy a very, very long time ago and

still uh still operates according to bureaucratic principles today.

Um This is from the feudal era of European statehood.

This is King John fighting against all of those local

power holders when they um when he violated the terms

of the Magna Carta.

So this is your response in a feudal situation to

overreach by the king is you have to try to

kill him.

Um, So yeah, feudal, the feudal system, you have tiered

power, you have a lot of independent power centres.

The peasants are tied to lords directly instead of to

the king.

Then when you move into an aristocratic system, you have

tiered status.

So all of the nobles outrank all of the peasants,

but they tend to only have basic landlord tenant relationships

with their own peasants, whereas the peasants owe their ultimate

political loyalty to the king.

Uh, both of these systems mean that the chief agents

of the state are also your potential rivals.

They have their own power bases and they might be

able to overthrow the king.

Bureaucratic systems tend to have tiered qualifications.

So in China and in most of the modern world,

you do civil service exams.

You get into the organs of state by qualifying, and

you're subdivided by your functions.

So this is a, this is the way the modern

states are organised, and this, this, um.

I think it occurs largely at the end of this

period in Europe, uh, is the move toward bureaucratic states.

Uh, and finally, with maybe 10 minutes left, we'll talk

about what states did.

So once you've created this colossal centralised power, what did

these emergent states, what did these kings do with it?

So the main areas of activity are war, mercantilism, providing

public goods, and providing law and order.

Uh, so the main thing they did was war.

The overwhelming majority of expenditures of almost all pre-modern states

was just spent on war and on servicing the debt

from war.

Uh, the famous line from Charles Tilly is war makes

the state and the state makes war.

Uh, this is definitely true in Europe.

There's some dispute over whether this is true in other

places, but in Europe, war is absolutely a key driver

of state formation.

Um, second, obviously it's the dominant focus of your both

your revenues and your expenditures and your debts.

All your debts are contracted during war and they're paid

off by your citizens over the course of decades.

But the main thing about war is that it's extraordinarily

destructive.

This is a negative sum activity.

So the winners get something better than they would have

gotten had they not entered the war, but the losers

lose more than the winners win.

Wars are fundamentally destructive.

Um However, there are potentially positive externalities, especially for naval

construction.

So, while armies mostly just consume a lot of food

and uh don't provide any substantial economic benefit, The navy

protects trade.

It helps train sailors who then go on to trade.

It's a much longer time horizon in which to invest.

So the navy provides many more of these positive externalities.

Um, and then the main thing you want to do

in war is win.

So, the fact that Britain tended to win most of

its wars is a huge factor in why it was

so economically successful, uh, because if you're involved in a

huge negative sum game.

The costs of losing are gigantic.

And so this, this kind of represents the transition.

This is a uh coastal fortress in East Sussex that

was built to potentially fend off a French invasion.

Um, and then here's the Battle of Trafalgar.

This is the much more effective way to fend off

a French invasion.

And the shift from land-based to uh water-based military expenditure,

as I think, I think it was in the reading,

um, that you guys did for the military topic, um,

was extremely good for Great Britain's fortunes.

Um.

Second, the second main thing states did was mercantilism.

This is essentially war through trade.

Um, it's the idea that Uh, you need to increase

trade, but you need to increase trade in a really

specific way.

You need to be importing raw materials and you need

to be exporting finished goods, and you need to be

exporting a higher value of stuff than you are importing

because that creates an inflow of coins, an inflow of

silver and gold into your state.

Um, they saw trade as zero sum.

So if you were trading with the Netherlands, you were

not trading with England.

So there were huge expenditures to try to take control

of trade routes and take control of raw materials and

the revenues from trade.

There were a lot of protectionist tariffs, and again this

was to create an inflow of precious metals that you

could then use to pay your soldiers, your sailors, etc.

um.

And sadly it's back.

Um, we're, we're now doing huge protectionist tariffs.

A lot of people have an idea that if you

are importing more than you're exporting, it's a disaster.

So this is, this is still a pretty common way

of thinking even today, um, is using trade as a

weapon rather than an exchange.

Um, next, this is, I think, almost entirely positive.

The other two are quite negative.

They're largely destructive of, um, kind of overall economic value.

This one is very good.

Um.

States provided public goods at a level that pre-modern states

were really not able to do at all.

So the most important public good physical protection.

Second, law and order, um, standardising weights and measures was

very important.

Every town, every region would have their own unique little

weights and measures, and this made trade very hard.

This made um.

This also made it easy to scam people.

If you had a bunch of different currencies, a bunch

of different uh weights and measures.

If you've ever had to exchange cash at the airport,

you know, it's very easy to get completely scammed, uh,

exchanging currencies.

Uh, they also built infrastructure, so roads, bridges and canals.

Up here, anything purple is a new canal that was

opened in the 1600s.

So in the 1600s, they're digging miles and miles and

miles of essentially artificial rivers, and this massively helps integrate

the English economy.

um.

And so the pre-modern state, they're massively underinvested in public

goods and so once the modern state comes along with

huge revenues and an interest in the entire economy of

a given territory, they can invest in a way that

a pre-modern state never could, uh, and this really increases

economic productivity.

Um, and then finally, um, this is the Royal Court

of Justice.

It's over there about 5 minutes away.

Uh, states provide legal frameworks, so dispute resolution and, uh,

contract enforcement are really essential for trade.

Having a unified national law code so you're not afraid

that you cross a jurisdictional boundary and suddenly you're on

the other side of the law, um.

Laws that protect property from uh private harm, but also

public harm.

Laws that protect your property from the government are very

important for promoting an environment where it's possible to save,

it's possible to invest, and it's possible to trade, um.

And then the legal framework for a lot of private

financial instruments actually comes from um investment in the public

debt.

So a lot of these financial instruments were developed to

loan money to sovereigns, and a lot of the first

financial institutions did most of their business by again loaning

to sovereigns, and so this helps create a legal framework

for the financial institutions that helped launch the industrial revolution.

And then finally, um, the legally constrained but very powerful

states, so states with a lot of reach into the

population, but with certain things they can't do, certain approval

they have to get before they actually do things to

the population.

These are the states that are most strongly associated with

growth, uh, up until right now.

So in conclusion, we have this really broad shift in

most of Western Europe from fragmented to unitary authority, uh,

from loyalty to multiple people to loyalty to a single

sovereign, um, but each of these forms of government was

probably appropriate for the period in which it found itself,

that there are solutions to different problems.

Uh, and these states don't evolve independently.

They're shaped by their competitors, and they're shaped by the

changing economic and political conditions on the ground.

Um, and then the, the credibly constrained, um, Uh, yeah,

the restrained monarch who has to ask parliament for approval

on the budget is really rare, uh, and there's still

a question in England whether it was overdetermined or underdetermined.

Could it have gone another way, um, yeah, could England

have ended up with a much more unconstrained monarch, um,

and then the effects of this, um.

Most of the direct effects are pretty negative.

More resources for war means more destruction, more rerouting of

trade, but the long-term economic effects were largely more positive.

By getting rid of internal barriers to trade, by investing

in public goods, by creating rationalised legal systems, the modern

state really set the foundation for modern economic growth.

And that's it.

I'll see you guys next week.

Thank you very much.

Uh, I think that was uh tremendous for a first

lecture.

So when Nick wins his Nobel Prize, you can all

say that you were there.

Where it all began.

Have a good week.

Enjoy the sun.

Yeah.

Yeah That was good.

Uh, I'm actually, um.

Absolutely I.

OK Mhm.

So generally.

I OK Right Thank.

Yeah put the.

Yeah.

Yeah I there's to be.

Bye bye.

I agree with that statement.

I.

I just said I found this thing out here.

nice.

That looks G.

OK, I'm gonna go get 4.

Sorry you're gonna eat sugar.

You're not real.

Oh my God.

S Yeah You said you're just gonna eat it.

All right see you guys.

You OK.

Oh.

Yeah.

No way.

I sat next to him.

Mhm The I Oh.

What?

Where?

Yeah.

They probably those ones.

Thank he's I'm just That I changed my.

I did.

Oh yes, you're just sitting she was You're going to

that.

Lecture 18:

Hi Yeah Yeah, I think.

Yeah You know In principle We Yeah If you go

beyond It Yeah.

I OK.

Yeah.

Anyway, OK, sorry for that, um.

Jordan sends his apologies, he's um away somewhere delivering a

conference paper, so I'll be.

Standing in for a minute and essentially delivering the.

Um, the package of material that he would have done,

this is what we have for today, um.

The overarching theme is.

Economic divergence.

Within Europe and between Europe and Asia, so there's.

There's a bit about divergence in Europe and coming from

that, there's some discussion of how do we know, how

can we measure what is it that we're measuring.

And what factors, part three, what factors can we use

to explain how divergence arose?

Then the great divergence, as it has come to be

called, which is Europe versus Asia, a long view of

growth and a wrap up rephrasing, representing the big question,

and a couple of things to add at the end.

So Uh Essentially that that's the thing that we have

to explain.

And OK.

That that there, that kink.

Was previously or or was for a long time known

in the in the in in the historical literature as

the European miracle.

So for a long time, nothing much happened and then

suddenly something did and that.

As the arrow point suggests there was the industrial revolution.

But there are.

Other ways of presenting that, which we'll, we'll come to

discuss, it doesn't have to be as sharp a curve

as that.

It might have been a more gradual increase.

It might have been an increase in some places and

a decrease or a decline in other places.

But whatever it is, it comes with, it is plain,

it is undeniable that there was more greater economic growth

in some parts of the world than others.

And so we want to think why, why and how

that happened.

And in answering it, it has to be a historical

answer, and it must be something that you can identify

before the divergence happened.

In the literature now, you'll you'll find, I think we've

at least in the classes that I've been, we've already

spoken.

The little divergence as it came to be called, which

is the divergence.

Within Europe A Whereby the Northwestern parts of Europe developed.

And The economies is pulled away from what had previously

been the centre of European prosperity.

To the south in the Italian city states.

The great divergence, as I said, we'll come, we'll come

back to that in a second chunk of the lecture.

So factually, according to the studies of.

Robert Allen and And others There was almost continuous.

Economic growth Northwestern Europe For about 400 years.

Whereas in Italy had around 1300 prosper There was Never,

never entirely happy with the word stagnation.

See There was no further progress and indeed possibly a

decline.

And we saw that.

2 weeks ago, looking at urbanisation.

Where you had a plot of the centre of gravity

of urban population moving progressively further northwards as Northwestern Europe

developed.

And you can see it in agricultural productivity as well

in the Productivity per capita per acre and.

OK And a question coming from that is, if you

can explain.

What what we've called here the little divergence within Europe,

does that lead you to a further further approach to

the divergence between Europe and the rest of Asia?

A bit later.

So the question remains, what, what was it that led

Northwestern Europe in particular to.

To break out of what had previously been Essentially a

musing economy.

Some of the things we've already covered in the course

here, the institutional Was it that they that there was

parliamentary control over the sovereign?

Was it the European marriage pattern?

Leading to Sport family size.

Was it transatlantic trade in particular the Import of Buy

And new crops from, from the colonies, or again, as

we saw a few weeks back, was it, was it

human capital, was it?

Inventive university and books.

Here's a graphical representation of what was going on.

The top one is the first one in blue is

is is London.

So there doesn't look like spectacular growth there.

Southern England following a similar trajectory.

Amsterdam somewhat in reverse, but starting out, starting out higher.

And then you get into the ones where there does

appear to be evidence of decline.

Valencia.

That's Leipzig, these are in the, these are in the

wrong order, and that's Milan.

So there you can see.

It's not as spectacular or as clear as that hockey

stick that we had on the first flight, but you

can see a divergence from what had been a more.

Compact position in 1500 to a more diverse position around

1800.

Notice the, we're going to talk in a moment about

this.

Not the, the axes, the vertical axis is welfare ratio,

which I'll discuss for you in a moment.

The horizontal axis is years, so quite a long period

of time covered by that graph, which if you stop

and think about it should raise a few questions.

What is it that you can measure?

You can Get data for it allows you to draw

a graph like that.

These are all in Europe, those many different places over

that length of time.

Oh there, sorry, there there was Leipzig.

Right, um, some discussion of measurement.

This, this might surprise you, this is from the FT

last week.

The Office of National Statistics compiles.

A basket, yeah, a basket of purchases which they periodically

update uh according to the.

Or In order to track the cost of the cost

of living index and as of last week they were

adding pulled fork, VR headsets, and mangoes.

To the cost of Now imagine that you were They

do this every year or every well, periodically anyway, uh,

and as, as per the a couple of weeks back

when I was talking about the cost of light, so

for example 100 watt light bulbs have dropped out of

the.

The price index, not some time back as well I

think.

So applying the basket idea um.

Bob Allen's name is attached to these two concepts.

He devised what he wanted to call uh a subsistence

or bare bones basket, the one on the right, and

uh.

Respectability baskets, the one on the left.

These, these, these look slightly different because I've.

Pin them from different papers.

The subsistence one actually continued on the right to cover

China as well.

Just for now, keep the, keep to looking at Europe.

And it should have, should straightway set you thinking um.

How do you draw up these baskets?

How do you make them applicable over?

Hundreds of years What data do you need to work

out the quantities that should be in the baskets, what

commodities, and then in order to work out whether people

can afford them or not, what prices are you going

to use?

Um, and you'll you'll notice that the one on the

right, the so-called subsistence or bare bones one, he estimates

is only about 1900 calories, which is.

I think slight slightly below what, slightly below subsistence, isn't

it, for, for, for men.

Anyway, um.

It's and also note the proportion of calories that come

from, in this case, oats.

So basic, basic grains, not even bread or wheat.

So the welfare ratio, which the Previous graph had.

Um, this is, this is.

is lifted from Bob Allen's paper.

The welfare ratio is one when an unskilled labourer working

full time could earn just enough to keep his family

at subsistence level.

So that would have meant buying a subsistence basket for

every family.

And that that gets you a welfare ratio of one.

If it's not that, then clearly the labourer has some

some surplus.

If it's below that, you're below subsistence, so you can

you can assume, you can imagine that family sizes.

It is shrinking.

There's another um.

There's another important variable in that.

It says working full time.

So again, you need to, to think what was full

time.

Any of those points along those 3 or 4.

grass covered This unskilled labourer, how many days?

It's usually taken to be 250.

Allowing for Less than weekends and church and public holidays

and festival.

But also you, you should think at the time, the

working day was a lot longer in summer with these

latitudes.

The working day was a lot longer in summer than

in winter, so 250.

Might be Might be off by quite some margin.

To those who were in my class, you might remember

I said at the beginning, we were going to talk

about teach you some economic history and also some of

the problems.

In trying to do economic history, and this is exactly

one of them, how to figure out what the consumption

basket might have looked like to work out whether people

were better or worse off and.

On the daily rate where the money came from.

One of the other numbers that we'll come across in

the And explained divergence is GDP, or more particularly GDP

per capita.

And again there are Different ways of calculating GDP.

These should should all come to roughly the same.

Kind of economics, arithmetical definition thing, they should come to

roughly the same answer.

But they have quite different demands for the data that

you might need.

Later on, we'll have a A graph from some work

by Stephen Brodbury, which actually combined uses the output measure

but supplements it with.

Um, income measures from part one.

And in any event, in order to get to GDP

per capita, having done that, you need to know how

many people there were, so you need another way of

estimating what the population was.

And if you want to know what the population was,

you've got to know what the, what the country, what

the area is that you're talking about.

So if the boundaries have changed, the population's probably changed

as well.

So, It's not so difficult in the case of.

England, because it's relatively small and has been a Consistently

Kingdom for a 1000 years.

But Germany Or China Right, and here's um.

At least from from these authors, and Rob Allen is

one of them.

Here's a depiction of welfare ratios again over the long

period from Sorry, this is a more recent period from

1700 to 1900.

Which does show, at least in in their treatment of

the data, the divergence of of London as representative of

England over the 19th and into the 20th century.

To be compared with the Uh, how can we say,

much less, much less variable.

Data that they that they claim for.

Milan and Beijing.

Um Another depiction of that and introducing.

Uh, a further metric on, on the, on the Y

axis here, international dollars.

If you haven't already, you will come across these.

This is a standardised 1990 purchasing power parity US dollar.

So bringing all those, those countries and GDPs to a

a a common basis in $1990.

This work from Stephen Brodbury suggests that The divergence of.

Uh, England or Great Britain started and Holland in particular,

started much earlier around, around the 18th century.

Um, One nice wrinkle to be considered in look this

is a this is a data, this is a data

question.

It may be that the the data that you have

for wages is what is is what was.

Paid by a client, but not necessarily what was received

by the labourer.

There can be a middle man that can track.

And Judy Stevenson, who was here.

In 2020 doing her PhD 2015 has this study which

suggests that just taking the data straight from the monastery

of the cathedral.

Stately home wherever the records were and saying they appear

to pay this much to their neighbours, that might be

overstating by about 20%.

Hence the lower graph in in red, just another.

How do we quantify divergence point?

How do we, how do we get to those graphs

that we were looking at?

Yeah What factors, what, what explanatory factors might lie behind

that this is still with reference to Europe particularly, but

starting to be applicable wider.

Maybe maybe it was international trade.

Which would be part of the the Netherlands story.

Or productivity in agriculture, um, measured by yield ratios perhaps

or.

or yield per acre or as we were talking about

a few weeks back, um.

Human capital I'm not sure that the parliamentary meetings index

has come up here yet, so we'll we'll come, come

to that in a moment.

The early, the early specialisation of the Dutch Netherlands in

in in.

International trade is clear in this one.

This is, this is per capita, so.

You need to think of it in terms of the

population size as well, but clearly in 1500, the Dutch

were specialising.

In shipping, their fleet was about 10 times the size

of anybody else's per capita.

OK, um, This, I think this this comes into play

in the urbanisation question as well, doesn't it?

This is how, how if you concentrate your population in

towns and cities, they still need to be fed, so

agriculture, agriculture needs to become more productive, and this is

a yield ratio graph, so this is.

Plant 1, get 4 or.

10 as appears to be the case later on for

Western Europe.

So does that tell a divergent story?

Well, it seems to.

In that northwestern Europe is.

Agriculturally more productive.

Southern or Eastern Europe.

A few weeks back, we we were looking at exactly

this paper from.

Burton and Van Zanden, where they had, they had suggested

that.

Consumption.

Not necessarily the same as reading.

consumption per capita was a reliable.

Great And in 1300.

It's only really be And not not by much, but

then By 18 Spectacular growth in book consumption.

Which does link Does line up nicely GDB graph that

we Sweden too and.

So So it looks as though human capital, if measured

by the proxy of per capita book consumption, might also

be part of the story.

So too, um, so too might parliamentary activity which.

was mentioned I think came into the discussion last week.

In this case, credible commitment in that there is parliamentary

control over the sovereign, which In northwestern Europe.

Rose and stayed and stayed there in Southern Europe.

It appeared to decline after about 1500.

This is measured by frequency of, of, of parliament parliament

meeting.

As a proxy for control over the sovereign in this

case.

Um And maybe also over over the long, over the

long term.

International trade.

A good driver of This is a graph of the

coefficient of variation in wheat prices across Europe.

The work of Max So you can see that the

volatility of wheat prices.

declining over It 500 years.

And with, with that, you would, you would say that

the, as the markets are becoming more.

So they're becoming more efficient and the costs of trading.

Oh sorry, the risks in trading are are reducing.

There there there's a a market integration and a market

efficiency story coming into play there as well.

Right.

Um Onto the, I'm not sure I've got the inverted

commas in the right place there.

The Sort of rhetorical question is.

How on earth did it come to to this that

That HMS nemesis was an iron-hulled ship.

That belonged to the East India Company.

Um, not just iron holes, but steam powered equipped with

guns.

Specifically designed or required.

To smuggle opium into China.

So this is the this is the time of the

opium.

So if you'd looked at the world in.

Um If you'd looked at the world in 1400.

You certainly wouldn't have been.

Likely guess that You'd be getting there in 400 years.

So the question that we.

Mhm I Leading to the same kind of The, the

trajectory What we know What was the shape What was

the shape of the divergences?

What have we got to explain?

Here's a version of the hockey stick that comes from

the the data collected by the Madison Project, which is.

A project started in 2010, I think, by Angus Madison

to collect.

And standardise and integrate.

GDP data over as many countries as they could get

data for and reference them to.

The 1990 standardised $1990 and that one.

Suggests that the the the hockey stick view that we

that we started with, that there was indeed a uh

a takeoff, starting around 1800, but that prior to that,

the differences were.

We're negligible.

In a slightly different presentation of it, again, look at

the red bars.

Italy in 1500 markedly more wealthy, which we know is

the the the the financial institutions in the city states.

But not huge variation across the rest, but by 1900.

Something has happened To North America and West and Northwest

Europe.

Here's the version that I mentioned earlier, the um.

The work of Stephen Broadbury and and and others, which

suggests a graph more like the second one there and

less like the hockey.

He worked with.

A comparison of The Two versions of the Yangtze Delta,

the higher productivity and the wider region.

Against compared with the European frontier.

One of the questions that I mean one of the

challenges that I mentioned earlier was establishing a relevant comparative.

Between two places when you're dealing with something on the

one hand, the size of China and on the other

hand, the size of, for example, the Netherlands.

So for this paper, they chose the most productive parts

of China to compare with the most productive parts of

Europe.

And in their, in their view with their.

Composite GDP per capita calculations.

Suggesting that divergence started around maybe 1600.

Somewhat earlier than before, and the divergence is at least

in their depiction of it.

As much made up of decline as it is of

European.

Development So why did it happen?

No.

Some things that we looked at recently that we that

we now know don't work, so was it the Protestant

work ethic?

Probably not.

Um Was it the consequence of colonialism and The Import

of large quantities of Latin American bully into Europe and

Um, other natural resources, cotton, crops and so on.

And did that differentially benefit the the Europe that imported

against the Latin America that It was being stripped.

You could think um.

If you like predestination, you could think that Jared Diamond's

idea of environmental factors plays, plays some part in this,

particularly since we've Have been through the Black Death and

acquired immunity to diseases, which is a large part of

his argument.

But if you think Do you think climate and geography.

great divergence.

You've got a problem in explaining why it happened when

it happened.

Because the geography was there all along.

And although the climate was variable.

Did anything happen particularly around The 18th and 19th centuries.

Something else is needed.

Joe Moia favours them.

A a more sort of basket approach whereby you can,

you can bring in a certain amount of climate and

geography and, and particularly.

Disease vector, but as you remember from a few weeks

back, he, he, he goes strong on Human capital and

the scientific revolution.

AJR Johnson and Robinson version is that The Best explanation

lies in institutional changes and the glory glorious revolution.

reduced the capricious power of the monarch.

parliamentary sovereignty in place.

With credible commitment and lower interest rates.

And with greater certainty, people had to work harder.

Which is the sort of thing we were talking about

last week, I think in the fiscal in the fiscal

state.

So we're heading again for where I think where this

course has been all along, but uh.

You're not going to find a single knockdown causal argument

that reliably addresses things.

Summary here of some of the drivers, uh, we'll talk

about the first one, the Kenneth Pomerantz one in a

moment, um.

Bob Allen has the real wages story, which is the

graph that you saw before.

Jared Diamond, not so much, um, a range of factors

that Nokia likes with human capital and institutions in there.

Or possibly bringing it somewhat of a laggard the.

Transformation brought about by the industrial revolution.

That one, it's a bit of a stretch, I think.

To say that that Got you the whole way to

the great divergence.

Now the book This is from, this is about 25

from 2000.

And before this, before this idea of the great divergence,

the the label as had been the European miracle.

Maybe not the happiest of labels.

But, um, Pomeranz here of the California School wrote this

in 2000.

And His There were several new things about this.

Well, first, firstly trying to explain it and not just

calling it a miracle.

Second, he, he pitched the timing much later than than

we've we've been looking at in some of the graphs

just now.

And the a large part of his explanation came from

coal and colonies.

So Northern Europe, England in particular.

was able to make a very quick and efficient change

from using only animal power to Co And the colonies

provided resources in the form of What what came to

be labelled ghost acres.

It was essentially a huge extension of Europe's available agricultural

land by growing stuff in the colonies, cotton.

But he started this um.

Uh, methodologically he started this idea of making relevant comparisons

between Carefully chosen parts of Europe and China, specifically England

and the Yangtze Delta.

See a moment ago with He did use and and

and uh.

As you can probably guess from its name, the European

miracle literature had been largely descriptive and qualitative, but he,

he got into quantifying what he thought.

Using GDP estimates.

Fiscal fiscal measures, farm yields, but he didn't, and these

are some of the things that um.

Tomoy and the AJR approach used, he didn't have much

to say about.

The influence The beneficial economical influence of warfare.

Or institutions.

Legal frameworks and justice and so forth.

Or human capital and knowledge.

So in the long run, This is to step, step

back a moment from um saying what we have to

explain is divergence.

Say, what are we really interested in?

We're interested in the economic past and not just that,

it ended up in a divergence.

But how did it, how did the economies actually work?

In that period.

So were the pre-modern economies actually in a in a

Malthusian trap and was peasant and you could read peasant,

you could apply the word peasant to.

was China as well as Europe.

Was peasant agriculture inherently state?

Is it on its own capable of of developing uh

economic growth, or conversely, was it necessary that that there

should be a a growing.

Class of impoverished urban labourers.

Working for wages that were necessary for growth.

Where and why waste some were some technologies adopted and

others and in other places not.

So for example, back to the picture that we had

a few moments back, why was that iron-hulled steam powered

gun mounted ship built?

For the East India built in England for the East

India Company.

When we know that China had had a, had metallurgy

hundreds of years before that.

What have I got I think we'll go to this.

So you remember you remember this quote from Janet Abuh

that there was, there was nothing essential, there was nothing,

no historical necessity about the development.

Western European economies as to anywhere else in the world.

And She had that map, you remember.

Well, as you can see, the European trading circuit is

very much an outpost, and if you wanted to say

where was the centre of gravity, you certainly wouldn't put

it anywhere near.

The Netherlands or England.

What follows, um, this is leading up to uh a

very, a very current restatement of the question.

That's a geographical I'm sorry, that's a geographical map of

the world, distorted only because it's projected onto a flat

surface.

But if you reshape things according to GDP in 2002,

you get a map that looks like that.

Where the area The the areas of the countries are

now blown up to reflect 2002 GDP.

And the flip side of that, infant mortality, this is

getting towards the um.

UN's Human Development Index question.

And now large is bad.

That's 2002.

Infant mortality.

And here's our here's to today's question.

GDP in Um, the beginning of the common era.

Interesting to know how they.

Got that for the Americans, but anyway, pass on that.

In 1500, you can see the centre of gravity shifting.

And by 1900, Which brings us to the question that

That remains today and Has anyone anyone read this what

this book?

Right OK, well, To restate the question, why, why are

some parts of the world rich and some poor?

That's today, that's a question for today as well as

a historical question, why did it how did it happen?

Um, theirs is largely an institutional explanation, it has to

be said.

Which is why they, which is, sorry, which is how

they answer that second challenge that the.

The answer is historical and the institutional arrangements that they

describe predate the divergence into prosperity and poverty.

Right, some announcements, um.

I'm sure you know that the essay is due tomorrow.

like for me to be telling you And it is

supposed to be anonymous.

It should be and it must be anonymous.

It is anonymous.

And the the instructions are on that.

Um please read the online submission.

So that you get the file name, file name right.

And do you know your candidate numbers?

Familiar with the concept.

And The last lot of essays I marked didn't all

have cover sheets on them, so this time please do

do that.

And complete both parts of it.

And finally, This is, this is the last of the,

as it were, content.

Next week Jordan's going to host a host.

Provide Facilitate a revision session.

So, I think he's, I think he plans to run

this as an interactive discussion.

Rather than him standing here talking.

S.

So come next week, if you like with ideas for

topic.

What Thank you.

Yes, you can clap.

you doing finance.

Yeah.

Oh You thank you.

I'm the same.

I'm the only.

Lecture 19:

Hey, everybody.

Wow.

here OK.

Oh, come on PC.

Come on, there we go.

Uh, no.

Uh, how do I do this now?

Um, I just need to read.

OK.

Thank.

Oh, are you kidding me?

I don't want teams just.

This is unbelievable.

Oh I like when two-factor authentication just keeps legitimate people

out of there.

Now let's try this again.

Tick Tock, alright.

We go.

2 minutes.

All right, if anybody has yet to fill in the

evaluation for this, I really appreciate it if you do

it right now.

I send you a reminder email which will be the

top, but you can also scan this QR code.

PR.

There's a man going around taking names.

And he decides who to free and who to blame.

Everybody will be treated all the same.

There'll be a golden ladder reaching down.

When the man comes about.

on your arm will stand up.

At the terror in each sip and in each suck.

Would you partake the last offer.

Or disappeared into the potter's ground.

When a man comes.

Well Summer time G So The virgins of.

What for me It's hard for thee to against the

priest.

Armageddon, no salon, no salon.

Then the father he would call his chicken h.

The wise men will bow down before the throne.

the chest that crown.

What It's unjust.

You can just do it, whoever is righteous.

Let him be righteous.

Just filthy.

Let him be filthy still.

Listen to the words.

So I was So.

2.

The world It was hard to be against the truth.

In measured 100 weeks and.

I I I All right.

So it turns out that uh it's actually very easy

uh to get the song of the week for uh

the last lecture, uh because there's many songs about reckonings

of various, uh.

So that was Johnny Cash, um, from the latter end

of his career, uh, when he teamed up with Rick

Rubin.

Uh, so if you're unfamiliar with that end of his

discography, I would very, uh, very much suggest you get

familiar with it.

Um, it's also time to award the Song of the

Week prize, which you probably didn't realise there was a

prize, um, but it goes to, uh, Sophia for her

engagement, um, and getting a significant, uh, number of right

answers.

I was thinking of getting it's Easter time, right?

So I was thinking about a chocolate egg, but then

I also thought, like, you're clearly a woman with, uh,

excellent taste, so we go to the Belgian seashells.

Uh, no problem.

So let's give, uh, Sophia a hand for.

Um, we're gonna get into revision today.

Uh, for anybody who trickled in late, I could, I've

sent you an email.

There's a QR code here.

Uh, if you could please take a few minutes to

give us some feedback, um, we would really, really appreciate

it.

Um, and yeah, so it should be near the top

of your emails if you haven't looked at it already.

Um, but what we want to do today is talk

about Uh, Revision, right?

So, uh, 33% of your grade comes from the summit

essay.

Uh, the remaining 2/3 of your grade comes from, uh,

a two-hour, uh, in-person exam.

We're set up for digi exams now, so it used

to be about, you know, how much you could write

with a pen.

Uh, you can use your laptop now, um, which should

make it a little bit easier.

There's 2 questions, 4 questions per section.

You answer 1 from each section, each question is worth

50% of your grade, right?

That's the format.

Um, so what is going on here?

Uh, this is gonna be really annoying.

Um, is there another?

Let me try this on, on.

All right.

Uh, OK, so just to talk a little bit about

where we've come from, where we've gone to, right?

Uh, we talked about exogenous factors, uh, geography, climate, the

environment, um, and our motivating question here was why, you

know, Eurasia, uh, experiences so much, uh, economic growth relative

to other parts of the world.

And one of the arguments here is that there's favourable

geographical endowments, favourable climate, right?

Um, Uh, within, you know, Eurasia, there's specific parts of

the world that do better than others, and there's, you

know, uh, examples or arguments about geographical endowments, environmental conditions

that might have privileged this part of the world, right?

That's where we started, exogenous factors.

We moved on to endogenous factors, right?

Population, fundamental factor of production, its relationship with available resources,

right?

All of that Malthusian stuff.

Which you know, some would argue explains centuries and centuries

of stagnation before breaking through the ceiling and achieving modern

economic growth.

Of course we have the fertility and demographic transition at

some point in this point where we move from a

high fertility, high mortality to low fertility, low mortality situation,

um, but this is the Malthusian model.

These we introduced as kind of uh.

Endogenous factors.

Another endogenous factor, right?

The social structure and this is kind of Marxist tradition,

economic development, economic change driven by uh the nature of

pre-industrial societies, which are often highly unequal hierarchical, right?

Um, we talked about feudalism.

Nick returned to feudalism, uh, in his, in his discussion

of states, uh, a few weeks ago.

Right, and remember it's kind of a reciprocal situation where

lords have vassals and then vassals have their own vassals,

all of that stuff.

Agriculture.

I'm biassed, you know, but this is important in the

mediaeval period, right?

We talked about why mediaeval agriculture tends to be organised

in this strange way.

These are the questions that Greg and I spend our

evenings and weekends trying to answer.

Um, agriculture is inescapably important for the pre-industrial period, right?

feed the population unless you have productive agriculture.

Even when services and before that manufacturing start to take

over as more dynamic sectors of the economy, they still

need to be fed.

You cannot release labour into manufacturing if your agriculture has

not increased its efficiency, right?

So agriculture is important.

We talked about gills in part because we're shifting out

of agriculture into manufacturing, which is a More dynamic part

of the economy which contributes a lot of growth, especially

as we get into the early modern period.

We also introduced institutions for the first time, institutions of

guild that regulated trades, regulated labour, often acted as kind

of pseudo quasi governments, right?

So there are two arguments that we're looking at manufacturing,

but we're also looking at the importance of institutions in

mediating economic development.

Um, Then we talked about proto industry, right?

Uh, this is, you know, an urban and rural story,

right?

And it's one of those, the first time we talked

about a very, very slick narrative, um, that, you know,

then needs to be tested with evidence.

Uh proto industry with rural manufacturing, um, but couched in

a very clever way that placed it as a necessary

first step for industrialization.

Uh, unfortunately, the historical evidence doesn't seem to stand up

to scrutiny, especially outside of Flanders, right?

Uh, then we looked at consumption.

So now we're, you know, we're in the manufacturing sector,

uh, but we're also talking about, you know, we're talking

about people making goods, but people wanting to consume those

goods.

And as soon as there's all these exciting things to

consume like sugar and tobacco and things like that, people

are willing to work harder in order.

To pay for those things, whereas previously, when all you

could buy with your money was maybe more and marginally

nicer food, people didn't work as hard.

That's the argument, right?

What is the contribution, you know, what is the contribution

of a desire to smoke a pipe to economic growth,

right?

Like that's what this comes down to, um.

Most of the industrial revolution is uh supported by wage

data.

We talked about some of the Uh, methodological problems, uh,

with basing meta narratives on wage evidence, but you know,

when wages are high, uh, people prefer leisure, uh, where

they seem to stagnate, uh, yet GDP goes up, which

means the, the industrial revolution explains that delta if you

believe the argument, right?

People are working more for stagnant wages.

We talked about the full spectrum of labour coercion, right,

starting from the even most innocuous things, being paid in

grain rather than in cash, which has a coercive element

to it because you're tied to that employer.

It's like the mediaeval company car right through to the

most abhorrent forms of chattel slavery which are important for

European colonial economies in the early modern period.

Uh, we talked about the model.

model that tries to explain why different regimes of labour

coercion arise in different parts of the world at different

times, right?

This is the classic impossible trinity trilemma problem.

You can only have two of these three things, and

the combination that appears in your time or place right

leads to different, you know, economic regimes that have different

kinds of labour regimes.

We talked about trade.

This is Smithian growth, right?

Uh, we thought about how, uh, the, the trade in

the pre-industrial world led to growth in the Smithian Channel,

but also this debate about whether, uh, commercialization is a

modern or an ancient phenomenon, right?

And that kind of depends on how you define globalisation

and what kind of evidence you're willing to accept, um.

Obviously one of the most important things that comes with

global market integration is this Colombian exchange, which a lot

of goods go back and forth between Europe and the

old world, but also crucially for the colonisation that comes

later, European diseases decimating, or even more than decimating populations.

This is people use decimating incorrectly all the time, right?

Does anybody know what the definition of decimating is?

The clue is in the desa.

So decimating, did I have a hand up somewhere?

Decimating is, you know, what the Roman army did to

punish ineffective legions is that they would just kill 10%.

Uh, every 10th man, you know, steps forward and is

killed, but now we tend to use it to mean

more than 10%, I think, right?

So anyway, moving on, um.

Yeah, so there was a nice settlers of Catan model

about the fundamental problem of exchange and how mediaeval trading

institutions, including the rise of money, help facilitate that trade.

Money is also important as a store of value.

And as part of the commercial revolution, uh, between 11

and 1320 is this monetization of the economy.

Um, we talked about early modern business and finance, uh,

which isn't like an explanatory model, right, or a sexy

idea like proto industry is, but clearly important in understanding,

especially how European economies.

Through and now we're just going off on our own

here PowerPoint um we also compare European business organisations to

Middle Eastern business organisations and how some of those uh

institutions were possibly more effective than others.

I do not know what is happening here.

Let's try this again.

Maybe if I do this, my.

Um, hm.

OK, I don't know what's going on.

We talked about early modern trade policy, right, which we

define broadly as mercantilism.

What is mercantilism?

Just think Donald Trump's trade policy, which unfortunately we know

all too familiarly with too much familiarity at the moment.

He's just unleashed another round of tariffs, right?

erect tariffs, strive for a trade surplus, um, you want

to be selling more than you're buying.

Out of that mercantilist drive, that jealousy of trade, coupled

with Europeans acquiring maritime technology means that Europe goes on

to conquer most of the globe.

Um, I honestly do not know what is happening here.

Um, I've got some kind of like slideshow going on

for some unknown reason.

Maybe this will do it.

Ah, so, anyway, uh, so that leads to the latter

end of our period where we're talking about European, uh,

colonisation.

We talked about technology, human capital, uh, and knowledge underpinning

both of those things.

What was that drive for, uh, what did that do

to economic growth?

What role did technology and knowledge play in economic development?

Some role, right?

Uh, very important, if you talk to some people, less

important if you talk to others, um.

And It's hard to measure, right?

Because technology is often just measured as a residual in

a production function.

Um, urbanisation, right?

Classic question is urbanisation cause or consequence of economic development?

It's always part of the narrative of economic growth.

We've talked about the move from agriculture to industry, from

countryside to towns that always results in urbanisation, right?

Um, and.

Uh, urbanisation is also used as a proxy for economic

growth when we do not have adequate data to measure

it in other ways.

Um, then we talked about warfare, right?

Uh, it's just like, Oh wow, OK, it's a good

thing it's the last lecture that this computer decided to

go crazy.

Um, war, right?

It's a function of mercantilist states, right?

War comes out of European states competing for trade with

each other, but you know, going back into the mediaeval

period, the fractured nature of European states, all these little

states led to a lot of warfare.

The long, the long run trajectory is that wars tend

to be less frequent but more deadly over time.

Um We also have uh a range of questions about

what this military revolution did for economic growth.

We have the Hoffman thesis about, uh, Europe.

Acquiring an advantage in military technology that contributes to the

great divergence, explains why Europe grew rich before Asia.

Then we had Nick Fletcher on state formation, right?

This comes towards the end of our period.

We can't really conceive of a world without states, but

they, you know, they grow out of these feudal relationships,

but then they become these entities that demand fuel in

terms of taxation, right?

So there's a body that has some kind of monopoly

of violence and military security.

Comes out of the need to provide security in an

uncertain world, but then this kind of fiscal military state

becomes, you know, perhaps the biggest feature of the early

modern economy, you know, ties into mercantilism, um, explains a

lot of warfare, uh, explains colonisation in a lot of

ways.

Could you have European imperialism without states forming first, right?

That's an interesting question.

Um, Right?

You get move from, uh, you know, into this fiscal

state where collecting taxes becomes increasingly important.

Um, then Greg talked to you about the great divergence,

right?

Uh, which is kind of the comparative aspect of where

our course ends, and one of the fundamental questions in

economic history, which has to be explained by something in

the pre-industrial period, right?

There's debate about when you date, when the great divergence

was dated, um, but How you explain it, it remains

an open debate, right?

The great divergence itself is a term coined in 2000

by Kenneth Pomeranz, but since then, a range of people

have talked about, you know, explanation.

We can go right back to the exogenous factors as

advocated by Jared Diamond, right?

Europe just had a better set of factor endowments, more

favourable climate.

Right, Joel Mokyr would say European advantages in knowledge and

science allowed it to overtake Asia and become a technological

leader.

Institutionalists like Halo, Johnson and Robinson just won Nobel Prizes

this year, um, say that it's European institutions, uh, you

know, guilds, but then parliaments, uh, then maybe the fiscal

state, all of those things that contribute to Europe's precocious

economic growth.

Um.

And you know, we might think a bit about the

evidence that people are using to underpin this kind of

argument.

And remember the Pomerans, right, he's only looking at England

and the Yangtze Delta as the two most economically vibrant

parts of the two different spheres of the world, which

was a very novel methodology at the time, but people

are moving beyond that now.

So, that is our whole course in a nutshell, and

the computer seems to uh be behaving at the moment.

Um, so, Now I want to talk a bit about

how to structure an effective essay.

Uh, nothing has changed from the first day, you know,

of the course, right?

We're looking for the same thing, but we put you

through the ringer, right?

This course is essay writing boot camp, right?

You've written a lot of them, you've gotten a lot

of feedback.

All of these same principles apply.

Uh, have an introduction that explains your argument, right?

Clearly tells me, I want to be able to know

exactly what your essay is going to argue by the

end of your introduction.

The paragraphs in the body, they just support your argument

thematically, uh, with case studies, and that's where you feed

in the evidence, right?

And the conclusion is not going to be very different

than your introduction.

It just restates your thesis, right?

This essay has demonstrated past tense, right?

That is all uh you have to do.

Um, the important thing to think about here is that

we want an argument and it wants to be a

we want it to be a cogent, uh, synthesis and,

uh, assessment of arguments and evidence.

We don't want a laundry list.

Not every point has to be balanced with the dissenting

counterpoint.

Don't just throw everything you've read into the essay and

say, who knows who's right.

We want you to have an argument, take a side,

uh, and demonstrate, you know, the evidence that underpins that

argument.

Let me illustrate quickly with some examples, right?

If I go.

Uh, to LSE exam.

Papers.

I should be able to find this.

Of course, I'll probably have to go through the like,

uh.

Signing mumbo jumbo again, but.

Yeah.

Mm.

Yes, please sign me in.

2017 and 2024.

Yeah All right.

So, this is the exam you're going to see, right?

8 questions.

You answer 1 from.

Uh, Section A, 1 from section B.

So The first point I want to make is that

there will be no surprises in this exam.

If you have been here.

If you've been following us, if you've been going to

class, you've been doing the reading, you will not be

surprised, right?

This is not an attempt for us to ask you

a trick question.

We're not interested in trying to trip you up.

Um, it is an exam where we are asking you

to demonstrate to us what you have learned.

It is not an exam that tries to figure out

what you have not learned, uh, because if we were

going to do that, I'd give you a multiple choice

exam.

Um, and I would save myself and Greg, a lot

of reading, right?

This is an opportunity for you to show us what

you have learned.

Um, Now I think it would be appropriate to take

some questions.

Does anybody have any questions about the exam, about the

course?

Right?

Practical things, impractical things.

Yeah.

Uh, It might break down like that, but not.

I have split the things into two questions, uh, so

look at that to force you to answer, uh, two

different components of the course, right?

Uh, it might not necessarily always break down by.

It might break down There is, is a reason to

answer.

Any other questions?

Yeah.

One Uh, I mean.

Uh I usually say generally that university essay writing is

a lot about unlearning what you've learned at A level.

Um, often because I find A level and interrupt me

if you disagree or would like to augment what I'm

saying.

I find A level instruction to be a bit about

point and counterpoint, right?

Well, there's this, but there's also that, and then there's

also this thing, but you have to think about this

as well and less about crafting an argument.

Um, now that being said.

You can have a nuanced answer that has contingencies, uh,

it has some nuance, right?

Uh, but it doesn't, is it one main point?

Possibly, is it multiple points, also possibly.

Do you want to come in on this?

Only to say that I have answered exactly that question.

About A levels.

we can see so it's not as prescriptive.

As as the A level approach, there's this and then

there's this.

What is expected, as Jordan was saying, is that your

view emerges clearly at the top, even if that view

is nuance.

We Are In the process of making you guys experts,

right?

You're not there yet because it's just your first year,

uh, but when you come out, you're expected to be

an expert, you know, in economic history, um, and in

crafting an argument, right?

Uh, so this we want you to demonstrate how you

craft an argument, take some ownership, take some agency, right?

It's not a Nobel Prize winning idea.

We're not expecting you to give us some insight in

your exam answers that doesn't exist already in the literature.

That's not your job.

Your job is to go to the literature, uh, that's

stored in your head, um, and you know, tell us,

uh, your take, right?

So let's think of some examples here, um.

OK, question two, right?

Was the performance of mediaeval European economy simply a function

of the productivity of their agriculture?

Support your answer with historical evidence.

So first of all, right, we're only focusing on Europe.

So, you can basically forget for the most part, uh,

at least initially about things I might have said about

Asian agriculture, right?

You might want to bring them in later, but it's

only asking you to answer.

So one simple straightforward, only one point thing is yes,

obviously, because 90% of the European population is employed in

agriculture and 100% of the population is eating grain grown

by agriculturists.

So the more productive agriculture you have, the higher population

you can um.

Uh, support the more human capital, uh, you then have,

and in the pre-modern world before, uh, modern scientific method,

innovation and technological development is simply a function of the

size of the population, so more agriculture, more population, more

invention done, right?

That is, yes.

Now, more nuanced answer, equally valid.

Yes, agriculture was important.

People need to eat and it provides a lot of

jobs, you know, however, um, there's a lot of things

in the manufacturing and services sector, uh, that drove the

economy.

So to, uh, if we take the manufacturing sector out

of it, we're not ascribing sufficient, uh, historical agency to

the growth of urban environments and.

Uh, you know, gains from trade, um, uh, or are

we appreciating the importance of institutions like guilds, uh, or

something like that, right?

So that's a more.

What's the word, not limited, but um.

Contingent answer that has kind of more subpoints, but still,

either way, this essay will argue that yes, the performance

of mediaeval European economies was a function of the productivity

of their agriculture.

Or this essay will demonstrate that the performance of mediaeval

European economies was in part explained by agricultural productivity but

also due to uh improvements in technology and uh gains

through trade in urban environments, right?

Like that's a multi point.

Does that make sense?

Uh, yeah, the, the, the yes answer is a kind

of trivial but true.

Because people had to eat.

But then if you're, if you, if you, if you

stop there, you, you've effectively said that productivity is fixed

and there's no, so nothing ever happened.

Beyond that.

So you need to look behind.

OK, so why my productivity have changed?

What would the What's the next equation?

What incentivizes any change?

A um.

Approach I would suggest here.

Is to devote some time at the beginning to making

a little plan once you've chosen questions, right?

Often less effective to just go stream of consciousness.

Uh, and now that you're writing a laptop, you have

a little bit more flexibility, right?

You might go off on a bit of a tangent

when you're writing your body as you start to remember

things and they tumble out of your head.

You might want to go back and revise your introduction

to make sure they uh align in this.

Uh, oh, sorry, in kind of this, uh, format, right?

Make sure that the body paragraph linked directly to your

introduction.

The other thing that I will say here.

Answer the question that we ask.

Choose the question that you're best prepared to answer.

Do not try to answer the question you wish we

had asked by crowbarring.

We use the term crowbar.

OK, what would you, what would you call it?

In this case, shovelling by trying to uh.

You know, uh, wedge in your preferred narrative underneath the

question, right?

Ask or answer the question that we've asked, right?

So think a little bit about the words we're using

again, there's no surprises here, but language is important, um,

so how important is technology, right?

That gives you a full, the full spectrum it's not

a yes or no answer, it's degrees, right?

That's important.

Um, in, in explaining the great divergence, OK, uh, what

else here?

Whereas what was the relationship between war and economic growth?

It's not asking you to assess how important it was

or wasn't, it's asking you to identify, uh, uh, a

link, right?

You'll notice that many of these questions.

Transcend themes, transcend weeks, right?

So don't just think, oh, that's from the war week.

It is from the war week but there's also relevance

from other weeks.

You want to try to connect war with states and

perhaps also with technology, right, which there's 3 weeks, 3

themes all bringing into one question.

Any other questions?

Yeah.

Yeah, so there's no right or wrong answer here, uh,

because it depends, well, it used to depend on how

fast you can write, now depends on how fast you

can type.

Um, we are looking for quality, not quantity.

That said, if you have one paragraph, right, it's unlikely

that you're going to be able to get the top

mark with an essay this long.

So, don't worry about life, right?

Worry about a clear argument with supporting evidence, and that

will take you to as much length as you have

time.

Ideas on this?

Long enough to answer the question in the time available.

So I've I've seen some clearly.

The writer has run out of steam and and somebody

blew the whistle.

Oh So I think the 1st 10 minutes when you

sketch out the ideas, there's all the, the brain dump

session and then you pick, right, I'll do these 3

because you then for these 4.

You figured that you've got time to do justice to

the points, and there will be some that you leave

behind.

Keep in mind I said throughout this course, this of

course raises more questions than it does offer answers, right?

So there are no model answers to these questions.

There's no right or wrong question.

um, I mean, as much as it might surprise you,

you could tell me that horses are entirely irrelevant for

economic growth in the pre-industrial world, and I will not

judge you for that, um, provided you have compelling evidence,

um.

So You know, there's no right or wrong answer, uh,

we just want you to have an argument.

Yeah, great question.

So we Acknowledge that this is an in-person closed book

exam under time pressure, right?

Uh, we do not expect you to have footnotes.

We do not expect you to have a bibliography.

We do not expect you to be citing specific things.

Now, A high quality, high quality essays often do have

some names sprinkled in, right?

Uh, but I would approach this organically in your revision,

right?

You don't need to drill yourself about names and dates

right now in 2009, uh, etc.

etc.

I think that would be like a second order or

even a tertiary issue that comes more with understanding key

arguments and concepts in the literature.

And then you might say, OK, Allen, right, high wages

led to the industrial revolution because it incentivize innovation, right?

So if you, you know, so if you mention Alan's

name, you know, that.

Uh, but it's not essential to have names.

We're looking for ideas.

Yeah, generally, yes, some, some names are inextricably linked to.

That that that The mental.

Well So you're probably going to remember those.

Anything else?

However you how works best for you, I mean the

one thing I would.

Advise against.

It's overprioritizing names.

Or trying to bamboozle us with, you know, That's Uh,

as depressing as this might be this might be to

admit, we spend a lot of time reading this literature

and have for years, so we know it, right?

If you just put in uh Moy because I think

he's written a lot of books, uh, that is not

strategy.

But the idea is.

Yeah Rehearse, rehearse the ideas about what is the role

of knowledge and technology and economic growth.

You're gonna read enough of Joel's work to remember that

that's the Molky idea.

Other questions on this side?

Yeah.

So that's a good question.

I will send a follow-up email.

Um, I think there's an app you need to have

on your computer, um, and I'm hoping the school has

sent some general instructions.

It might involve going to IT in the library.

Uh, I don't have it here, but I I know

where to find it.

Those of you who are in my class, I, I

did download and show you.

The What pages on the it's it's on the LSC

exam.

Which tells you what you have to go, what you

have to do to download and install this.

It does helpfully warn you, don't try and do this.

Um I'll send a, I'll send a follow-up email.

And just to add to that for the benefit of

those who might think this way, you are allowed to

ask for paper as well.

So if you like to sketch ideas.

I You can do that Because the digi exam I

think is basically an electric typewrit.

very little Let's Yeah I did the exams.

So everybody will have the right.

Um, now, What are the principles of what I'm saying

about essay exam essay writing, I think are uh reasonably

universal.

That said, One of the golden rules uh about university

is figuring out how to give.

Certain people what they want, right?

So, uh, I would listen very carefully to what EH10

1 professors and teachers might be saying about, uh, exam

strategies.

You know, that probably is a hint that if they

have something that diverges from what I'm saying, absolutely do

that because it's about, you know.

Yeah Any other questions?

Jordan, if you could go to.

On the moodle on the moodle.

Uh, Greg's class is 10th March 2025.

Uh, so is it in a week or is it

the top?

No, it's week 9.

It's war week, week 7.

That's And then go right down to the end.

Yeah, OK, so here is, if you go to Greg's

slides, uh, he has a link very helpfully to this

e-exams guide.

Anyway, I'll email it to everybody, but it's, it's on

the Moodle.

It's there.

OK, other questions.

Um.

We have like a few minutes left, so.

Um Yeah.

So I would basically probably start with past exam questions,

also the class question and the essay question.

So, what can I say?

These are questions from last year's exam.

These questions will not be on this.

Um, There is only a finite number of questions I

can ask you.

So if you look at these, you look at the

class question, you look at the essay questions, you're gonna

have a very good idea of the kind of questions

gonna appear on the exam, and there's only 8 of

them.

So I would basically start with one of these questions.

Uh, and make a little essay plan.

How would I answer this question?

And then start thinking like, OK, what kind of, you

know, what readings would I use to support it, go

back to those readings, what examples might I draw out?

And I would probably just iterate that process, right.

Um, you could also, you know, revisit your notes, you

know, once or twice, but I would advocate like a

targeted approach of kind of doing practise questions that forces

you to seek out the information that you need to

answer it, um.

It's probably a better use of your time than trying

to reread.

Um That's yeah, 2.1, if you go, if you go

back more than 2 or 32 or 3 years, you'll

find the exam was set by somebody else.

So if there's a question that you don't recognise at

all from the weeks that you've been here, just forget

it.

Yeah, don't, don't, don't think, oh God, I've missed all

this.

for a, yeah, so, uh, yeah, last year's exam would

be a good one, yeah, if, if you see a

past exam question that looks totally for it's probably because

it is, uh, which is why I would say focus

on whatever last year's exam, um, and then the essay

question.

These questions will not be on your exam in the

form that they appear here.

The topic's absolutely will be.

As I've said, because there's only so many ways that

Greg and I can articulate this thing there what have

we talked about?

We talked about agriculture.

We've talked about, uh, war.

We've talked about exogenous forces.

We talked about Malthusian ideas.

All of those are going to be on the exam

in some way, right?

There will be no surprises.

Any other questions Uh, all right.

Well, on that note, um, thank you so much for

a very enjoyable year.

This is my favourite course to teach.

Uh, I appreciate that you have all indulged me and

Greg in listening to us all year, but the pleasure

has been all ours.

Do not fret about this.

There's no, there's, there will be no surprises, and you've

been here with us all year.

You know this stuff, you're going to be fine.

Thank you for a terrific year.

I wonder if it was this thing misfiring that was

causing it to go stuck or something yeah yeah.

All right.

Oh.

Uh yeah yeah yeah that one yeah yeah next year

I think we'll have that one.

Yeah.

OK, each paragraph should have a sentence at the beginning

which makes it clear what that paragraph is about and

that's one part of your argument.

um so there's the overarching thing which is in in

in this essay I will argue that.

And then each paragraph following it, different points in each

one.

But I would not focus at all on other factors.

Focus on the factors that the question is asking about.

Do you want to argue?

And then as a second issue thing, you think there's

an important kind of counterpoint or you know other story

that you want to demonstrate you're aware of, then think

about that, but do not think about a necessary number

of counterpoints, right?

So if you talk about agriculture.

You know how you know how, how important is agriculture.

The bulk of your business should be about agriculture.

If in the conclusion you want to say, of course

this excludes the possibility or overemphasises the importance of agriculture

by ignoring the dynamics of the uh manufacturing sector.

That's enough, right?

So I would focus exactly what the question is answering

and if there's an important, you know, uh, contingent factor

or, you know, something else, uh, right, or what if

I asked you how important was coerced labour for the

development of pre-industrial.

You're gonna want to talk about coerced labour in some

form, be it serfdom, be it slavery, be it wages

paid in kind, um, you know, it, it, then you

might say, however, you know, uh, the, um.

There, there are other things that led, important thing that

led to development like institutions like trade, etc.

etc.

So I would only think of the limiting factors as

like a secondary or trickier.

I would, I mean, I, I wouldn't focus at all

on numbers, right?

This isn't a quota.

This isn't a box ticking exercise, right?

We're not going there and saying how many arguments for

and how many against at all.

We just want you to have take ownership of an

argument.

Um, the only reason to include, include a counterpoint is

if you want to demonstrate that, uh, you know that

there's another important factor as well, right?

um.

And that you're not totally myopic.

Let's step outside.

coming in.
