The Baring Crisis and the Great Latin
American Meltdown of the 1890s
Kris James Mitchener and Marc D. Weidenmier
The Baring Crisis is the nineteenth century's most famous sovereign debt crisis Using a database of more than 15,000 observations, we assess its effect on emerging market borrowers and find empirical evidence of a regional crisis but not a global crisis. During the crisis, Latin American yield spreads increased by more than 200 basis points relative to the rest of the world, even after controlling for macroeconomic, trade, political-institutional factors, and other countryspecific effects. Our evidence suggests that European investors may have sold off or reduced their holdings of Latin American securities in the wake of the Baring Crisis.
Frequent financial crises in emerging markets during the past two
decades have driven economists and investors to understand their
nature, causes, and consequences. These episodes are often characterized by volatile capital flows, unsustainable or noncredible commitments to fixed exchange rates, currency mismatches, liquidity mismatches, and weak regulation and supervision of banking systems. Some studies have emphasized the role of contagion, the process through which a shock in one country can lead to a price movement in another country in excess of the underlying fundamentals.1 For example, some research has pointed to the role of asymmetric information, informed and uniformed investors, and political variables in the transmission of the Asian financial crisis.2 Others have stressed the importance of common creditors in propagating crises. To reduce overall portfolio risk, financial institutions in the common-creditor country (one with large holdings of emerging market debt) reduce or sell off their as

THE BARING CRISIS OF 1890
To understand the events leading up to the Baring Crisis, we beg our account in the early 1880s - after Argentina and Latin America finally shaken off the long-lasting effects of the world debt crisi 1873. With the election of Julio Roca as president, Argentina witne a resurgence of foreign trade and capital flows from Europe. The fu were used to construct railroads and public works and modernize B nos Aires.8 Roca's first major loan was a railway issue that complet two major trunk lines. The construction of a transportation netwo throughout the country further consolidated the central governm power and stimulated economic activity by opening up the market commercial agriculture. Roca also transformed Buenos Aires into th "Paris of South America" by constructing broad avenues, spac parks, a well-functioning water supply and drainage system, and a m ern port. Between 1880 and 1886 the national authorities and the g ernment of the province of Buenos Aires carried out a series of precedented state-run development projects in Latin America.9 As a result of the open capital markets that prevailed in the ninete century, Argentina was able to borrow extensively abroad. It was t fifth largest sovereign borrower in the world. It absorbed roughly percent of all new issues in the new London market between 1884 1890 and 40 to 50 percent of all lending that occurred outside United Kingdom in 1889. (In contrast, North America had a populat 20 times Argentina's and floated only 30 percent of the new issues London.)10 Alan Taylor suggests that "the 1880s stand out as a period totally unprecedented capital inflows into an emerging market at a time in history." The current account deficit, as a percent of GDP, a aged 20 percent from 1884 to 1889.11 Although the economic policies of the 1880s stimulated shorteconomic activity in Argentina, they posed potentially serious long

The banks that participated in the note issuance scheme floated loans in Europe to finance the purchase of the domestic gold bonds that backed note issuance. This scheme worked as long as foreign investors agreed to purchase the Argentine bonds and as long as additional note issuances were backed 100 percent by specie.

of leading financiers to restructure the count committee demanded that the Banco Nacional transfer funds to service
the country's short-term debt obligations.22 In exchange, the committee agreed to underwrite a bond issue that could meet Argentina's remaining debt service for a period of three years. Argentina subsequently experienced a severe banking crisis (in January 1891) brought on, in part, because Banco Nacional' s financial position was weakened when it transferred assets to British creditors. As the financial crisis worsened, the Bank of London and River Plate was the only bank that did not close its doors. Meanwhile, Argentina suffered a deep recession, with its real GDP falling by 1 1 percent between 1890 and 1891. The country did not fully recover from the crisis until the turn of the century, after more than a decade of monetary and fiscal reforms. There is some evidence that the Argentine crisis may have spilled over to other countries in the region. Gail Triner and Kirsten Wandschneider suggest that the Baring Crisis had significant effects on Bra

We view the two events as being linked. Eichengreen, "Baring Crisis." Eichengreen, "Baring Crisis."

To gain some insight into the Baring Crisis, we collected weekly prices on long-term government bonds from the Economist with maturities greater than ten years.28 The database contains over 15,000 weekly observations of bond price data from the London Stock Exchange for 41 countries and British colonies, for the period 1 887-1 895.29 Unlike Niall Ferguson and Moritz Schularick's database of annual sovereign yield spreads, our sample of emerging market borrowers employs the same long-term bonds for the entire sample period.30 In contrast, the Ferguson and Schiilarick sample of interest rates splices two different bond series

August 1 890 - evidence that British investors were becoming particularly concerned with the situation in Argentina at this time. The Banco National, a major Argentine national bank, informed Baring Brothers in July that it would suspend service on its foreign debt obligations, a sign that a deeper banking and debt crisis was emerging. Finance Minister Francisco Uriburu needed to pass a broad-based fiscal reform package so that the note issues used to prop up the banking system were not seen as the sole means for dealing with the economic crisis. His reform package failed, and he resigned in early July. The government tried to lend to note-issuing banks to prevent a liquidity crisis, but without the reform package, bank runs began. A few weeks later, a group of military officers unsuccessfully tried to overthrow the Argentine government. President Miguel Juarez Celman then resigned on 6 August 1890, in response to public discontent over his decision to pursue policies of open inflation and acceptance of ex
ternal default rather than liquidation of the "official" banks.34
34 The Foreign Securities Section of the Economist also began devoting more attention to Argentina's economic problems during this period. The Stateman's Yearbook (1892, p. 331) noted that, "The events of July 1890, which caused the resignation of President Juarez Celman and a severe crisis, greatly disturbed the resources at the disposal of the Government during the last year."

then increased from 100 basis points to more than 1,000 basis points following a debt default that lasted until 1897. Country risk for Uruguay followed a U-shaped pattern prior to the onset of the Baring Crisis, and then climbed from around 100 basis points to over 600 basis points by 1892 (Figure 5). The rise in the country risk premium may reflect, in part, news of a banking and commercial crisis in Montevideo that helped lead to a severe recession. Uruguayan debt prices are then not quoted on the London market after the country briefly defaulted on its debt obligations. Figure 5 also shows that yield spreads in Venezuela rose to over 900 basis points in 1892 before declining to a level of 500 basis points by the end of the sample. Consistent with the graphical evidence, the weekly record of the sovereign bond market from the financial press suggests that, in addition to any country-specific events that moved sovereign spreads, the Baring Crisis may have been a common factor driving Latin American securities in the early 1890s.36 Indeed, the newspaper clippings of the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders (a British entity representing the interests of sovereign debt holders) indicate that the Argentine crisis may have had real economic effects on other Latin American countries. For example,
36 Suter, Debt Cycles, p. 81 states: "Thus, the crisis was triggered by the state insolvency of Argentina, the Latin American debtor country most strongly incorporated into the Atlantic economy."

the Star and Herald (Panama City) commented on how the banking and merchant relationships between Argentina and Paraguay transmitted the financial crisis to the landlocked South American country,37 and The Bullionist (London) wrote:
Paraguay, like Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil, is undergoing a financial crisis, and this crisis was recently described by the Finance Minister to Congress in the form of a report . . . They were traceable, without a doubt, to the condition in the Argentine. There has been a general falling-off in trade, which has given rise to a feeling of uneasiness and want of confidence, and since the beginning of 1 890 things have been getting worse.38
The Buenos Aires Standard discussed the economic effects of the Ar
gentine crisis on Uruguay, a country with close financial and merchant ties to the South American country:
It must be borne in mind that such is the intimate connection between both coun
tries that as long as Argentines suffer from crises, Orientales [The Oriental Republic of Uruguay] cannot expect to flourish.39

Figure 5 YIELD SPREADS FOR URUGUAY AND VENEZUELA, 1886-1896 (weekly intervals, basis points)
Source: Authors' calculations based on data from the Economist.
In January 1891 the South American Journal (London) called the "the violent economic crisis, which overtook the country last July ... a logical repercussion of the Argentine crisis and the English crisis."40 The events in Barings seem to have also affected Central American borrowers. The South American Journal wrote the following about Costa Rica in 1891:
The fall in Costa Rica "A" and "B" bonds was not in any way due to the internal affairs of the country, but due to the disturbances in July last between Guatemala and Salvador, followed by the troubles in the Argentine Republic, producing a depression of all stocks.41
It appears that financial markets may have also been reassessing the debt of the region en masse. The reassessment may be due to a "wakeup" call (where other countries in the region were seen as having economic characteristics similar to Argentina) or a common creditor channel (where one particularly influential lender, such as England, shifts its portfolio out of the region), two explanations given for contagion during the Asian financial crisis.42 The Economist, for example, frequently commented on the effects of events in Argentina on the sovereign debt prices of other countries in Latin America. The Economist referred to Central and South American securities in the early 1 890s as a group dis

tinct from other countries and regions of t time noting the importance of country-spec Consider the following report from the 5 Section of the Economist:
The feature in South American descriptions has been the heavy fall in Argentine Cedulas, which close about 3 percent lower all round, although the final prices are somewhat above the usual. The fall has been due to the great rise in the gold premium at Buenos Ayres-which has resulted from the passing by the National Bank of its demand. This action of the Bank has raised anew great doubts as to its stability and its ability to get through the present difficulties without shipwreck. All other issues such as Uruguay, Brazilian, & c, have given way sympathetically.
For the Economist then, the prices of other Latin American bonds were moving in unison with Argentina's. The Times of London also frequently noted that Latin American securities fell together, even though debt prices for other emerging markets were generally flat:
Business has been quiet in the Foreign Market, but the tone was fairly steady, and except in the case of South American issues, which were again weak on very discouraging news from Buenos Ayres, there are not many changes to report.43
The financial press also reported that investors had difficulty in pricing Latin American bonds. This lends credence to the notion that asymmetric information may have played a role in the sell off of Latin American securities. On the eve of the financial crisis, 5 June 1890, the Financial News remarked on the lack of information about Latin
American securities available to bond market investors.
The market for South American securities is much more extensive than is generally supposed, and in it you get a large variety ... Of course, most people know something - usually rather too much - about Argentina, Brazilians and Uruguays; but when they get to such securities as Paraguayan and Colombian bonds, or to the issues of such States as Nicaragua and Salvador, they feel, to say the least of it, that, unlike the dyer, their hand is not accustomed to that which it works . . . The whole market, as we have shown, abounds in anomalies.44
The Economist described a similar problem in assessing the value of Latin American securities:

According to the financial press, it was perhaps easier be indiscriminate rather than try to accurately deter tries would weather the storm. (A similar assessme curred during the early stages of the East Asian crisi York Times wrote three years after the start of the Barin

But the public does not discriminate - or rather, in times lik fuses to be attracted by probabilities. South Americans are in ge and it must be admittedly, deservedly.47
The Financial News made similar remarks:
Then the distrust produced by the financial catastrophe in the Argentines and Uruguay has naturally reacted on Brazil, and led most people of ordinary caution to withdraw their money from the country, as being tarred with the same brush as other South American republics. Under such conditions, nothing but the most conservative financial policy could prevent Brazil from suffering severely
from the withdrawals of gold and restriction on foreign business which were inevitable.48
The qualitative accounts found in period newspapers and financial publications and the individual country plots indicate that the Baring Crisis likely affected borrowers throughout Latin America. We now broaden our analysis to consider whether the crisis affected all emerging market borrowers and not just those located in the region.
45 Economist, 17 October 1891. For example, Radelet and Sachs, "East Asian Financial Crisis," describe the early stages of the 1997 East Asian financial crisis as one in which "creditors made little effort to distinguish between these Southeast Asian economies."

Baring Crisis 479
To determine if the Baring Crisis had differe based on their location or level of developmen sample of countries and colonies into three countries, non-Latin Emerging markets, an European countries and the United States. O dex for Latin America consists of 11 count Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Me guay, Uruguay, and Venezuela.49 We constr index of non-Latin American emerging mar Austria, British Guiana, Canada, the Cape Greece, India, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Natal, Zealand, Norway, Queensland, Russia, Sou Tasmania, the Ottoman Empire (Turkey), Vic tralia.50 The core country index consists of pean countries (Belgium, France, Germany United States.
Figure 6 graphs the average interest rate for Latin and non-Latin emerging markets as well as the core countries in our sample. As shown in the figure, interest rates are generally quite flat over the sample period for the non-Latin Emerging markets and the core countries. The small increase in interest rates for the non-Latin Emerging Market Index can be completely attributed to Greece and its debt default in 1893. Bond yields are flat for the non-Latin emerging markets over the sample period if Greece is excluded. Interest rates for Latin American emerging markets, however, display a very different pattern, rising from about 600 basis points in 1890 to more than 1,200 basis points by the end of 1895. One reason that rates continued to rise in other Latin American countries several
years after the onset of the crisis may have been related to the ongoing failure of Argentina to fully renegotiate its debt and establish a stable monetary environment. (No agreement for defaulted provincial debt and railway guarantees was concluded until after 1897.) Alternatively,
49 Although Portugal and Spain are not in the Latin American sample, we also test throughout the article whether our results are sensitive to the inclusion of these two countries in the Latin
American sample, given that the two European countries had significant trade linkages with their former Central and South American colonies. One argument for including Portugal and Spain as part of the Latin American sample is that remittances may have been important for these two countries during our sample period. As shown by Esteves, "Pulsacoes Financeiras," remittances from Brazil were especially important for Portugal. The large drop in remittances during the early 1 890s help explain why Portugal left the gold standard. We excluded Honduras from Figure 6, given that its bonds were in deep default. The coupon rate for Honduras was 2.5 times greater than the price of the bond for much of our sample period. British Guiana is included in the non-Latin emerging market sample because it is a member of the British Empire whose bonds were guaranteed by Her Majesty's Government.

European investors may have been unable to assess the severity of the crisis due to lack of information. Because Argentina may have been seen as a bellwether economy that was used by investors to gauge the fiscal and monetary health of other borrowers in the region, the delay over a full debt settlement may have raised concerns among foreign investors that other less-developed countries in the region would face even greater challenges in restoring fiscal and monetary order to their economies after the crisis. The financial press did continue to report, some three years after the onset of the crisis, how economic and political events in Argentina had a significant effect on bond prices throughout the region.
Summary Statistics of Changes in Yield Spreads
The time series graphs of yield spreads and the interest-rate indexes intimate that the Baring Crisis had a larger effect on Latin America than on other emerging markets and core countries. To complement these figures, Tables 2-4 present summary statistics of changes in yield spreads between 1890 and 1894 for Latin American borrowers, nonLatin American emerging market countries, and the core countries in our sample. We examine the performance of emerging-market, interestrate differentials by analyzing the one-year, two-year, and four-year

WHAT FACTORS ACCOUNT FOR THE MOVEMENT IN BOND YIELDS DURING THE CRISIS?
Panel Model and Data
To analyze why yield spreads moved during the crisis, we construct a panel data set consisting of annual data for our sample of 35 emerging market borrowers, which includes macroeconomic indicators, trade variables, institutional arrangements and political factors, and countryspecific controls.53 In an ideal world, we would include modern macroeconomic variables such as gross domestic product to measure the economic effects of the crisis; however, because data of this nature are available for only three out of ten Latin American countries in our annual panel sample (Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay), we instead employ a variety of indicators that were readily available and widely used by emerging market investors in the late nineteenth century to assess country-specific financial risk.54 This empirical strategy enables us to construct a data set with the largest possible number of potential determinants of yield spreads and is a similar approach to what Ferguson and Schularick and Marc Flandreau and Frederic Zumer employ in other studies on the classical gold standard era.55 To capture how investors viewed the macroeconomic conditions of emerging market borrowers, we employ seven measures: a variable that measures interest-rate movements in emerging markets; the budget deficit (expenditures-revenues) as a share of revenue; the ratio of total public debt (internal and external) as a share of government revenue; a dummy variable indicating whether the country is in default and has stopped servicing its foreign debt; the natural logarithm of the British wholesale price index; the trade balance (exports minus imports) scaled by exports; and the sterling value of exports per capita. To capture general fluctuations in interest rates, we include an emerging market con
53 One reason we shift our analysis from weekly to annual frequency is so that we can control for macroeconomic factors that influence yield spreads. For earlier papers exploring yield spreads during the gold standard era, see Bordo and Rockoff, "Gold Standard"; and Obstfeld and Taylor, "Global Capital Markets." 54 The most recent historical GDP estimates are available from Angus Maddison's website at www.ggdc.net/maddison/. Prados de la Escosura, "International Comparisons," provides an alternative dataset of historical GDP estimates for the gold standard period, 1870-1913. Although his sample covers 23 countries, it only includes one Latin American country (Argentina) and gives GDP estimates for five benchmark years: 1870, 1880, 1890, 1900, and 1913.

We also included some measures to capture potential channels through which the crisis may have spread.

We use this measure to examine whether changes in trade affected bond spreads. Second, we interacted the U.K. trade share variable with the Latin American dummy to analyze the effect of British trade on Central and South American yield spreads. Third, given England's role in the Baring Crisis, we added an interaction term between the U.K. trade share variable and
the crisis dummy to see if the crisis spread globally through trade ties with England. Finally, we interacted the crisis variable with an indicator variable for being on the gold standard in order to test whether countries that had fixed exchange rates experienced the Baring Crisis in a different way.

For the dependent variable, we constructed annual yield spreads by averaging the weekly data used in the time series analysis discussed ear
lier. We primarily rely on data from Ferguson and Schularick for the construction of various macroeconomic and trade indicators.64 In order
to increase the sample size, we gathered additional trade data from British Board of Trade Publications, Fenn 's Compendium, the Statesman Yearbook, and the Annual Reports of the Corporation of Foreign Bondholders. We calculated country trade shares with the United Kingdom using these same sources.
Empirical Results of Panel Analysis
The empirical results for our sample of 35 sovereign borrowers appear in Table 5.65 All models are estimated with country fixed effects in order to capture unobserved differences across countries, including other country-specific macroeconomic determinants that may have affected yield spreads. To control for correlation across countries in a given year, we clustered the standard errors on a group-year fixed effect.66 The group-year variable is constructed by dividing the sample into three sub-groups - Latin, non-Latin, or core countries/colonies and then multiplying the regional indicator by the year.67 We specified a dummy variable to measure the effect of the Baring Crisis on yield spreads given that there is statistical evidence of a trend break in the
64 Ferguson and Schularick, "Empire Effect." The sample of 35 borrowers includes five high-income countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, and the United States), 23 non-Latin emerging markets (Austria, British Guiana, Canada, Cape Colony, Egypt, Greece, India, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Natal, New South Wales, New Zealand, Queensland, Portugal, Spain, Russia, South Australia, Sweden, Tasmania, Turkey, Victoria, and Western Australia), and seven Latin emerging markets (Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Uruguay, and Venezuela). We drop Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Norway from our earlier, weekly sample due to insufficient data on covariates. Argentina is excluded from the panel regressions because it is the crisis country. For a discussion on techniques for dealing with correlation in cross-sectional units in fixed effects models, see Cameron et al., "Robust Inference." 67 The empirical results are also robust to estimating the model with heteroskedasticconsistent standard errors or clustering on year.

The baseline
model captures roughly 84 percent of the variation in yield spreads. The country risk premium, ceteris paribus, is positively correlated with general movements in emerging-market interest rates, although the effect is only weakly statistically significant (at the 20 percent level). All else equal, a country in debt default has yield spreads that are more than 387 basis points higher than a sovereign borrower that is servicing its debt. An improved budget-deficit ratio reduces the country risk premium by nearly 30 basis points, but the effect is not statistically significant. The other macroeconomic and trade variables (the debt-revenue ratio, the trade-balance ratio, and exports/population) do not have statistically or economically significant effects on sovereign yield spreads. Adherence to the gold standard, the price level, and the conflict variables also do not have statistically significant effects on the country risk premium.70 The Latin and empire variables are dropped from the analysis because they are time-invariant covariates. The second column of Table 5 presents results that include the Baring Crisis indicator variable as well as the proxies used to examine the potential channels through which the crisis operated. Debt default continues to have a large economic and statistically significant, positive effect on bond spreads. Yield spreads are positively correlated with the emerging-market interest-rate variable, although the effect is not statistically significant.71 Consistent with the baseline specifications, the macroeconomic and trade variables generally do not have a statistically significant effect on country risk. The only exception is exports per capita, which is significant at the 10 percent level. Membership in the gold standard and the conflict variables do not lower sovereign risk, but countries with a larger share of trade with the United Kingdom may have lower sovereign yields, although this effect is not economically or

statistically significant. The price-level variab cally significant effect on country risk, implyi contribute once other factors are taken into account.
If we turn to the variables specific to the crisis, we see that the Baring Crisis does not seem to have affected all sovereign borrowers given that the crisis indicator variable is not statistically significant at conventional levels. But its interaction with the gold standard is statistically significant, lending support to the hypothesis that the gold standard lowered sovereign risk during the crisis. Bond market investors may have viewed gold adherence as a signal that a country would pursue prudent monetary and fiscal policies during a period of financial turbulence.72 Consistent with the summary statistics and graphical evidence presented earlier, the Latin-crisis variable (the interaction between a Latin America indicator variable and the Baring Crisis indicator) has a large positive and significant effect on yield spreads. According to the point estimate, the crisis increased yield spreads in Central and South America by 214 basis points. Trade may have been a channel through which the crisis spread. The U.K. trade share variable interacted with the crisis dummy increases country risk by roughly 20 basis points (evaluating the point estimate of one at the mean U.K. trade share of 20), although the effect is not statistically significant at conventional levels (19 percent level of significance).73 The U.K. trade share variable interacted with the Latin American raises country risk by approximately 80 basis points (evaluating the point estimate often at the mean U.K. trade share in Latin America of eight), although the effect is significant at only the 20 percent level.74 To test the joint significance of the crisis variables, we took the partial derivative of yield spreads with respect to the crisis dummy variable. The three variables raise country risk by nearly 240 basis points for Latin American countries and are jointly significant at the 1 percent level.75
72 On the other hand, the interaction may be picking up another way of measuring the net effect of the crisis in that departure from gold is often causally related to a financial crisis. 73 We also estimated a model that included an additional independent variable: the Latin American crisis dummy interacted with the U.K. trade share variable. This triple interaction variable (Latin * crisis * U.K. trade share) is statistically significant at the 5 percent level in the fixed effects model. However, the correlation between the Latin American crisis dummy and the triple interaction variable is 90 percent. Given the high correlation between the two interaction variables and the fact that the U.K. trade share variable is nearly constant over our sample period, we interpret the statistical significance of the triple interaction variable as evidence consistent with the baseline results reported in column 2 of Table 5. We obtain similar results if Portugal and Spain are included as part of the Latin American sample. The results are available from the authors upon request. 75 If we take the partial derivative of yield spreads with respect to the Latin American dummy variable, then we find that the interaction terms are jointly significant at the 10 percent level.

Discussion
The two variables driving the results are clearly debt default and the Latin American-crisis interaction effect. The economic interpretation of the debt default variable is relatively straightforward: countries with a history of defaults borrowed at higher rates. The Latin American-crisis interaction term is open to multiple interpretations. One is that the interaction simply captures some omitted effect common to all Central American and South American borrowers. Another interpretation is that European investors sold off Latin American bonds following revelations of Argentina's economic problems. This latter interpretation is consistent with two possible explanations of what was happening: investors experienced a wake-up call and withdrew their funds from countries similar to Argentina, or a common creditor (British investors) reallocated its portfolio away from Latin American debt. A "wake-up call" would suggest that Argentina's default signaled the potential for crises to occur in other countries; given this new information and the belief that other Latin American countries had characteris
tics that were broadly similar to those of Argentina, emerging market investors then sold their Latin American securities.76 This interpretation is similar to what some economists suggested occurred during the East Asia crisis.77 The fact that the bond spreads did not rise for the Latin American countries in the months preceding the crisis is consistent with a wake-up call interpretation of the Baring Crisis and similar to what has been observed during the East Asian Crisis.78 Incomplete information about the financial health and growth prospects of particular Latin American countries might have made it difficult for investors to assess risk on a country-by-country basis prior to Argentina's default, and might help explain why a wake-up call and a sell off Latin American debt by British investors occurred.79 The fact that European investors lacked all the information
76 The Economist noted the bellwether status of Argentina during this period, noting that bond prices of other South American securities moved when those for Argentina moved {Economist, 29 April 1893). 77 Radelet and Sachs, "East Asian Financial Crisis." Sovereign credit ratings for East Asian economies by major private credit-rating agencies did not decline in the 1 8-month run up to the East Asian financial crisis. This has been cited as evidence that rating agencies and private creditors were asleep at the wheel prior to the outbreak of the crisis in Thailand (Goldstein, Asian Financial Crisis). 79 There is some evidence that the "wake up call" that may have occurred during the East Asian financial crisis was exacerbated by asymmetric information problems. According to Goldstein {Asian Financial Crisis, p. 19), "creditors did not have accurate information on the creditworthiness of Asian borrowers (e.g., external debt turned out to be much larger, and international reserves much smaller, than indicated by publicly available data)." Of course, for our period, the problems may have involved both inaccurate and incomplete information.

they desired is well documented by the Corpo (CFB), which represented British lenders, an part, to give them better information on sove records of this organization (the Annual Re the constant frustration of bondholders wh and timely reports on fiscal balances, mone receipts of debtor nations. Although it would be difficult to design a def asymmetric information during our sample per sensitivity analysis that sheds some light on pr formation. We estimated a model that uses available information on
country-specific macroeconomic and financial characteristics to explain yield spreads, but excluded Latin American debtors from the sample. We find that the macroeconomic and trade variables (as well as the conflict variables) generally have a statistically significant effect in the explaining the cross-sectional behavior of yield spreads for non-Latin emerging market borrowers.81 The fact that a regression model can explain non-Latin yield spreads, but not Latin American ones, provides some statistical evidence that asymmetric information may have played a role in the financial crisis. Even if such information had predictive power, it was not available for many countries of interest in the region. Several Central and South American countries, which we would have liked to have included in our full panel specification, lacked adequate financial and trade data from sources available to contemporary investors (such as the Investor 's Monthly Manual and the Statesman 's Yearbook). The paucity of data for the region made it a more challenging environment for investors to distinguish good risk from bad risk, and might help explain the sell-off of Latin American debt. The presence of a common creditor could also play a role here.82 Investment banks that lent to Argentina were largely concentrated in London. Burned by the Argentine default, British investors might have cut back their Latin American lending to reduce their exposure to similar risks. The decision by these investors to adjust their portfolios and shift funds to other emerging markets or to British colonies could have been based on the belief that countries in the region had trade patterns, fiscal
80 Mauro and Yafeh, "Emerging Market Spreads." 81 For example, unlike the baseline results reported in column 2 of Table 5, we find that the debt-to-revenue ratio significantly boosts yield spreads by approximately 120 basis points, interstate war raises them by 46 basis points, and a better trade balance lowers them too. Debt default raises yield spreads by 660 basis points and exports per capita increases sovereign risk by about 15 basis points. A common-creditor channel has been used to explain recent episodes of financial contagion in East Asia and Latin America, Dornbusch, Park, and Claessens, "Contagion."

histories, and corporate governance similar to Argentina' ing of their positions would not necessarily proceed at a it might thus help explain why bond spreads continued to a year after the crisis. To test the common creditor hypothesis, we re-estimate model in column (2) of Table 5, adding two interaction te the effects of the Baring Crisis outside of Latin America. acted the empire indicator variable with the crisis dummy European investors reduced their holdings of Latin Ame and replaced them with "British-guaranteed" colonial bo non-Latin emerging markets. Then, we interacted a non-e market variable with the crisis dummy to capture the effect Crisis on British colonies and developing countries ou America. Although the empire interaction variable is not s nificant, we find some evidence that yield spreads in non Latin emerging markets actually declined about 42 basis p the outbreak of the crisis.83 The falling yield spreads (an prices of non-Latin emerging market debt) provide som U.K. investors shifted some of their funds to non-Latin emer during the early 1890s.
CONCLUSION
This article examines quantitative evidence of the effects of the ing Crisis on a global sample of emerging market borrowers. Usi new database of more than 15,000 bond prices collected from Economist, we find that the Baring Crisis was largely a regional nomenon. The average sovereign yield spread for Latin American tries in our sample increased by 844, 759, and 1,608 basis points one-year, two-year, and four-year periods after the onset of the fina crisis. Yield spreads in non-Latin emerging markets and core cou were generally flat during the same period. We then analyzed the determinants of sovereign yield spreads be 1886 and 1896 in a panel framework to understand why the crisis w gional. We were particularly interested in determining whether th American effect could be explained by macroeconomic fundamen budget deficit ratio, a ratio of debt-to-revenue, a default indicator var trade indicators (trade balance, exports per capita), political variab terstate and domestic conflict), and institutional variables (such as bein
the gold standard) - information available to emerging market investo
