Abstract We present new evidence about the relationship between military conflict and city population growth in Europe from the fall of Charlemagne’s empire to the start of the Industrial Revolution. Military conflict was a main feature of European history. We argue that cities were safe harbors from conflict threats. To test this argument, we construct a novel database that geocodes the locations of more than 800 conflicts between 800 and 1799. We find a significant, positive, and robust relationship that runs from conflict exposure to city population growth. Our analysis suggests that military conflict played a key role in the rise of urban Europe.

1 Introduction
The economic rise of Europe is a watershed historical event. Many scholars argue that cities played a central role in this rise (e.g., Smith 1776; Weber 1922; Pirenne 1925; Mumford 1961; Bairoch 1988; Hohenberg and Lees 1995; Glaeser 2011). One thousand years ago, the urbanization rate in Europe was less than 4 %. Even Rome was only 5–10 % of its size under

the Roman Empire. By the start of the Industrial Revolution, however, Europe had become highly urbanized (van Bavel et al. 2013, pp. 392, 394). What explains Europe’s dramatic urban growth? This paper analyzes a main feature of European history: military conflict. According to Tilly (1992, p. 72), early modern Europe was at war in 78–95 % of all years. In this context, historical cities were “safe harbors” from conflict threats (Glaeser and Shapiro 2002). Historical cities held key defensive advantages over rural areas (e.g., fortifications). In the words of Adam Smith (1776, p. 250): “The inhabitants of cities and burghs, considered as single individuals, had no power to defend themselves; but by entering into a league of mutual defence with their neighbours, they were capable of making no contemptible resistance.” We argue that, to escape the destructive effects of warfare, rural inhabitants under the threat of conflict relocated to cities. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first city-level analysis of the relationship between military conflict and urban growth. To test this argument, we construct a novel database that spans the fall of Charlemagne’s empire to the start of the Industrial Revolution. We identify the geographic locations of all conflicts fought on land in Europe from 800 to 1799. In total, our data include more than 800 conflicts and nearly 700 cities. To measure city exposure to conflict threats, we geocode conflict and city locations at the local (grid cell) level. The results of our econometric analysis show a positive and significant relationship that runs from conflict exposure to city population growth. We find that conflict exposure was associated with a 6–11 % average increase in city populations per century. To put such magnitudes into perspective, average per-century city population growth between 800 and 1800 was 22 %. Our most conservative estimate thus suggests that conflict-related city population growth was responsible for roughly one-quarter of average per-century city population growth over this period. We show evidence that this relationship is robust. Our benchmark model accounts for time-invariant local characteristics and widespread shocks through fixed effects. To further address the possibility of omitted variable bias, we modify the benchmark model to include country-century interaction effects, which help account for the evolution of country-level features (e.g., nation-state building), and grid-cell specific time trends, which help account for unobservable time-varying local features (e.g., rural-urban wage differences). In addition, we interact century fixed effects with observable time-invariant local characteristics (e.g., Atlantic trade potential) that may influence city population trends. Finally, we control for citylevel observable features including urban networks and political, educational, and religious characteristics. Larger cities may be more attractive targets for attackers. Country-century interaction effects and grid-cell specific trends help account for demographic trends at the national and local levels, respectively. To further address the possibility of reverse causation from urban size to conflict exposure, we control for pre-existing trends and mean reversion effects by interacting initial city populations with century fixed effects. In addition, we perform placebo tests and other tests for reverse causation. Such tests provide further evidence that the direction of causation runs from conflict exposure to city population growth and not vice versa. To complete our analysis of the safe harbor effect, we present evidence on conflict types and on city walls. Our paper contributes to the literature on the historical origins of state capacity. Warfare is a prominent explanation for nation-state formation in Europe (Tilly 1975, 1992; Mann 1986; Brewer 1989; Downing 1992; Besley and Persson 2009; Gennaioli and Voth 2014). Tilly’s (1975, p. 42) famous statement is: “War made the state, and the state made war.” According to the standard account, governments made institutional reforms that enabled them to finance military efforts and defend against survival threats. What this literature tends to overlook,
123


J Econ Growth (2016) 21:259–282 261
however, is that institutional innovations at the city level were often historical precursors to state-level innovations (Stasavage 2011; Blaydes and Paik 2015). Our results show that before “war made the state,” war helped “make the city” by driving rural inhabitants under the threat of conflict to relocate behind urban fortifications. In this way, our results improve our understanding of the state formation process. In a related manner, our paper contributes to the literature on the historical origins of economic development. Scholars have linked historical warfare and state formation with modern prosperity (Bates 2010; O’Brien 2011; Rosenthal and Wong 2011; Dincecco and Prado 2012; Voigtländer and Voth 2013a, b). As described, our results show that warfare helps explain the historical transformation from countryside to city. Urban density facilitates economic activity by reducing the costs of exchange for goods, labor, and ideas (Glaeser 2011). Our results imply that warfare promoted historical development by driving rural inhabitants into cities where they could take advantage of agglomeration economies. In this regard, our paper offers a new way to understand the economic rise of urban Europe. The paper proceeds as follows. The next section develops our argument. Section 3 describes the database and measurement. Section 4 presents the econometric methodology and the main results. Sections 5 tests for robustness. Section 6 presents further evidence. Section 7 concludes.
2 Conceptual framework
This section performs two tasks. First, we discuss the relationship between military conflict and city population growth in European history, with a focus on the safe harbor effect. Second, we describe factors beyond military conflict that may help explain historical urbanization.
2.1 Military conflict and city growth
2.1.1 Safe harbor effect
Scholars trace urbanization in medieval Europe to the ninth-century break-up of Charlemagne’s empire (Rosenthal and Wong 2011; Stasavage 2011).1 The number of independent states in Europe grew from less than 10 in 800 to more than 200 by 1300 (van Zanden 2009, p. 33). Political fragmentation created instability and warfare, which van Zanden (2009, p. 34) describes as follows: “This decentralization of political power often resulted in continuous warfare among the local lords, but at the same time led to an intensification of power at the local level.” Urban fortifications enabled rural populations to escape from some of the most destructive effects of medieval warfare (Smith 1776; Pirenne 1925; Mumford 1961; Hohenberg and Lees 1995; Rosenthal and Wong 2011). Glaeser and Shapiro (2002, p. 208) write:
The first, and probably most important, interaction between warfare and urban development is that historically cities have provided protection against land-based attackers. Cities have the dual advantages of large numbers and walls and thus, holding the size
1 City founding years often long preceded the fall of Charlemagne’s empire. Boone (2013, p. 221) writes: “Broaching the subject of the origins of medieval urban Europe may wrongly suggest that the city was a totally new phenomenon in European history. In fact, in many cases medieval urbanity was built on a solid urban tradition, at least in those parts of Europe heavily influenced by the Roman Empire or Romanitas.” After the fall of the Roman Empire, urban centers typically saw decay, but did not typically disappear (Boone 2013, p. 222). In addition, new cities were founded during the medieval era throughout Europe including Central Europe (Livi-Bacci 2000, pp. 21–27).
123


262 J Econ Growth (2016) 21:259–282
of the attack constant, it is much better to be in a city than alone in the hinterland. Indeed, the role of cities in protecting their residents against outside attackers is one of the main reasons why many cities developed over time.
Glaeser and Shapiro (2002) call this effect the “safe harbor effect.” In medieval Europe, scale advantage was key to military victory (Glaeser and Shapiro 2002). Urban fortifications—including outer rings of conjoined dwellings, defensive palisades or ramparts, and fortified walls—were difficult to break through or surmount, enabling small groups of defenders to fend off even large groups of attackers (Tracy 2000b). Mumford (1961, p. 250) states: “Against sudden raids a wall, on guard at all hours, was more useful than any amount of military courage.” Furthermore, urban fortifications engendered a scale economy. As city size increased, there was a sharp drop in the required amount of fortifications per person (Glaeser and Shapiro 2002). Military campaigns could inflict numerous costs on rural populations. There was manpower losses in the fields, first because peasants were war recruits and second due to campaign-related deaths (Gutmann 1980, p. 75). Crops, farms, and homes were destroyed due to arson. Peasants were responsible for large tax burdens during conflicts and for repair costs for damages to physical infrastructure (Caferro 2008, p. 187). Since peasants had to billet soldiers, peacetime preparations for future campaigns were costly (Hale 1985, p. 197). Hale (1985, p. 196) writes: “In terms of personal impact the burdens of war certainly afflicted the rural more than the urban population.” Thus, to escape the most destructive effects of warfare, we may expect to observe rural inhabitants under the threat of conflict to relocate to cities.2
2.1.2 Target effect
The safe harbor effect implies that there should be a positive relationship that runs from military conflict to city population growth. Glaeser and Shapiro (2002) also identify a “target effect” whereby larger cities were more attractive targets for attackers. Since urban density facilitates plunder, attackers will prefer large urban concentrations, ceteris paribus. According to this argument, the logic runs from city population size to military conflict (the opposite of the safe harbor effect). Furthermore, if a city did not possess the military might to protect its wealth, then the target effect may have led to urban destruction. In that case, we may expect to observe a negative relationship between military conflict and city population growth. Our econometric analysis ahead will account for the target effect.
2.1.3 Other effects
Beyond the safe harbor effect, there are at least two other effects that may generate a positive relationship that runs from military conflict to city population growth. First, Henderson et al. (2015) identify a “rural poverty effect” in modern-day Sub-Saharan Africa whereby dry agricultural conditions induce rural inhabitants to migrate to cities in search of better economic opportunities. Similarly, in the context of European history, the destructive effects of warfare
2 Anecdotes highlight the historical role of cities as safe harbors beyond Europe. For example, Reid (2012, pp. 3–4) writes about Sub-Saharan Africa: “Elsewhere, warfare has been one of the drivers of urbanization, especially in the Western half of the continent; in some areas, the roots of urbanization lie in itinerant royal camps comprising armies and their enormous entourages, whereas in other circumstances, communities have come together in fortified urban clusters for protection, a phenomenon associated particularly with the nineteenth century—among the Yoruba, for example, or the Nyamwezi.” [Our italics].
123


J Econ Growth (2016) 21:259–282 263
in the countryside may have promoted rural-urban migration. What distinguishes the safe harbor effect from the rural poverty effect is that the former effect is anticipatory (it should occur under the threat of conflict) whereas the latter effect is reactionary (it should occur in the aftermath of conflict). Second, Voigtländer and Voth (2013a, b) identify a “Malthusian effect” (also see Galor and Weil 2000) in which a large shock (the Black Death of 1348–50) reduced the rural population and thereby increased rural wages (where a fixed amount of land is an important factor of production). Higher wages increased the demand for manufactures produced in cities, which in turn promoted urbanization. We will provide specific evidence for the safe harbor effect in Sect. 6. However, we will not be able to rule out the role of the rural poverty effect or the Malthusian effect.
2.2 Alternative explanations
Beyond military conflict, scholars highlight other factors that may help explain historical urbanization. Initial conditions are one such factor. Rokkan (1975) argues that key river trade routes led to early urban growth. Tilly (1992) emphasizes early commercial activities. Abramson and Boix (2014) argue that urban clusters were most likely to form in productive agricultural zones. White (1962) and Andersen et al. (2015) relate the adoption of the heavy plow to greater urbanization in zones with clay soils. Motamed et al. (2014) find that a location’s agricultural potential and transport costs influence the likelihood of urbanization. By contrast, Bleakley and Lin (2015) argue that locational fundamentals are not the only determinants of city sizes. Another strand of literature highlights political factors. De Long and Shleifer (1993), Acemoglu et al. (2005), and van Zanden et al. (2012) link representative government, which they argue protected private property rights, with greater urbanization. However, Stasavage (2014) argues that, due to their oligarchic structures, self-governing cities had negative longrun consequences for urbanization. Other scholars focus on human and social capital. Dittmar (2011) shows evidence that urbanization was fastest where the moveable type printing press, which promoted new merchant skills, was adopted. Using city-level data, Cantoni and Yuchtman (2014) find that university training improved legal infrastructure and reduced trade costs. Greif and Tabellini (2010) argue that weak kin relations led to urban growth as a way to facilitate wide-scale cooperation. Guiso et al. (2008) show evidence that the medieval establishment of free cities had consequences for the development of social capital. Nunn and Qian (2011) highlight the seventeen-century introduction of the potato to the Old World, which can improve agricultural productivity and increase the returns to urban manufacturing. Furthermore, the potato’s positive productivity shock can increase per capita income, which is positively linked with urbanization. Iyigun et al. (2010) show that there is a negative relationship between the introduction of the potato and violent conflict in Old World regions that were suitable to potato cultivation. Our econometric analysis ahead will account for these sorts of economic, geographic, political, and social factors.
3 Data
Our urban population data are from Bairoch et al. (1988), who provide city population data for all European cities that ever reached 5000 inhabitants between 800 and 1800 at
123


264 J Econ Growth (2016) 21:259–282
century intervals for 800–1700 and half-century intervals for 1750–1850.3 To help maintain estimation intervals of equal lengths, we focus our analysis on century (rather than the halfcentury) intervals.4 Our city population sample runs from 900, just after the ninth-century fall of Charlemagne’s empire, to 1800, just before the start of the Industrial Revolution in Continental Europe.5 We linearly interpolate (but never extrapolate) missing observations. To account for city-level features, we merge the Bairoch et al. data with data from Bosker et al. (2013), which leaves us with an unbalanced panel of 676 cities.6 Our historical conflict data are from Bradbury (2004) and Clodfelter (2002).7 Bradbury (2004) provides data on all military conflicts in the medieval West. The Bradbury data are organized into chapters, each of which covers a different geographical area of medieval warfare. Within each chapter, there is a summary of each military conflict fought, including a description of the conflict’s location, approximate date, and type. The Bradbury data end in 1525. We use the Bradbury data for military conflicts over 800–1499. The Clodfelter data start in 1500; we use these data for military conflicts over 1500–1799. The Clodfelter data are organized into chapters by century and geographical area. We focus on military conflicts fought in Europe. The historical conflict data may be subject to measurement error. Even if Bradbury and Clodfelter are unable to record all conflicts, however, it is likely that they include the most important conflicts as documented by historians. Still, the quality of data documentation may differ by place. To help account for local differences in data quality, our econometric analysis ahead will always include city fixed effects. Our unit of analysis for military conflict is an individual conflict (e.g., battle, siege), which could be a one-off event or part of a larger war. The Bradbury data categorize military conflicts as individual conflicts. However, the Clodfelter data categorize military conflicts under war headings. Each war heading has an entry of several paragraphs that describe the war’s details. To identify the locations of the individual conflicts that comprise each war, we read through each entry in Clodfelter and compiled a list of all individual conflicts. Table 1 displays an example using the Thirty Years’ War (1618–1648), which by our reading contains 37 individual conflicts. Historical accounts cannot pinpoint the exact geographical locations of military conflicts. We thus approximate conflict locations by the settlement (i.e., hamlet, village, town, city) nearest to where they took place. This method is both feasible, given the lack of available
3 Thus, we use all available population data, including for cities with less than 5000 inhabitants at some point in time. Table A2 of the online appendix shows the result for the most stringent specification (i.e., column 4 of Table 3) when we (i) exclude cities that never reached 10,000 inhabitants and (ii) only include city-century observations for city populations greater than or equal to 10,000. For (i), the estimate for Ci,g,t−1 is 0.067, with p-value 0.031. For (ii), the estimate for Ci,g,t−1 is 0.063, with p-value 0.057 (we lose nearly 40 % of observations). Table A9 of the online appendix shows the result for the most stringent specification when we normalize per-century city populations according to Black and Henderson (1999). The estimate for Ci,g,t−1 is 0.092, with p-value 0.020.
4 The Bairoch et al. data do not include 1100. Thus, we interpolate (but never extrapolate) observations for 1100. de Vries (1984) is an alternative data source for European historical urban populations. However, the de Vries data do not start until 1500. Bosker et al. (2013) compare the Bairoch et al. and de Vries data for each century from 1500 to 1800. They find very similar estimates for urban populations; the correlation coefficients range between 0.986 and 0.992.
5 The nature of warfare changed dramatically over the nineteenth century due to improvements in transport and communications technologies and the rise of the mass army (Onorato et al. 2014).
6 We updated the urban population data according to Bosker et al. (2013) for Bruges, Cordoba, London, Palermo, and Paris.
7 Tilly (1992) and Jaques (2007) are two other sources for historical conflict data, both of which support the argument that military conflict was a defining feature of European history.

battle took place near the commune of Mons-en-Pévèle in northern France. We thus assign the geographical coordinates of Mons-en-Pévèle to it (50◦28′49′′N, 3◦6′11′′E). Table 2 summarizes the historical conflict data. Military conflict was a key feature of European history: 847 land-based conflicts took place from 800 to 1799, for an average of 85 per century. The tenth century saw the least conflict, with 15 recorded conflicts, while the eighteenth century saw the most, with 295. Breaking the data down by modern-day countries, France saw the most conflict over this period, at 165, followed by Italy (135), England (103), Germany (103), and the Low Countries of Belgium and the Netherlands (66). To measure city exposure to military conflicts, we use 150 km × 150 km grid-scale cells.8 This size of grid cell roughly corresponds with NUTS2 units (e.g., county, province, region), the basic unit of economic territory devised by Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union. To provide a sense of perspective, the Tuscany region in the center-north of Italy is roughly 150 km × 150 km. Florence, the capital of Tuscany, is located near the center of this region. The distance from Florence to Livorno, the region’s main port on the Tyrrhenian Sea, is roughly 90 km as the crow flies. Reyerson (1999) claims that fourteenth-century horseback travel in Italy could cover 50 kilometers per day.9 Thus, we estimate that the historical travel time by horseback between Florence and Livorno was less than two days. Another example is the distance from Siena, also located near the center of Tuscany, to Grosseto, a southern Tuscan port. This distance is roughly 77 km as the crow flies. Thus, we believe that 150 km × 150 km grid sizes are appropriate.10 We only include 150 km × 150 km grid cells that fall (at least partially) within the borders of modern countries for which there is at least one sample city. 196 grid cells include at least one sample city. 95 % of total conflicts between 800 and 1799 fall within a grid cell that contains at least one sample city. To put it differently, only 5 % of conflicts do not fall within a grid cell that contains at least one sample city. These conflicts are rather distant from any sample city (e.g., they are located in Ukraine, Finland, Norway, or Sweden). 90 % of grid cell-centuries saw 0 or 1 conflicts from 800 to 1799. Thus, in line with the approach taken by Besley and Reynal-Querol (2014), we construct a dummy variable
8 We use a cylindrical equal area map projection with geometric center (longitude, latitude)=(10.00735, 46.76396), near Davos, Switzerland. Figure 1 displays data in the projection of analysis.
9 Reyerson (1999) claims that medieval horseback travel from Paris to the Mediterranean coast, a distance of approximately 750 km, took 12 days. At a rate of 50 km per day, this trip would take 15 days. This duration is roughly in line with Reyerson’s claim about medieval horseback travel time for Italy.
10 Table A8 of the online appendix shows the results for the fixed effects specification (i.e., column 1 of Table 3) and the most stringent specification (i.e., column 4 of Table 3) when we use 75 km × 75 km grid cells. For the fixed effects specification, the estimate for Ci,g,t−1 is 0.153, with p-value 0.002. For the most stringent specification, the estimate for Ci,g,t−1 is 0.049, with p-value 0.095.

for each grid cell that equals 1 if there was (at least one) military conflict in that cell for each century from 800 to 1799, and 0 otherwise.11 This approach reduces the influence of unobservable factors that can affect the total number of conflicts to which sample cities were exposed. 95 % of grid cell-centuries saw 0, 1, or 2 conflicts from 800 to 1799. Thus, as an alternative, we construct an ordered variable for conflict exposure that assigns a value of 0 to each century that a grid cell saw peace, a value of 1 to one conflict, and a value of 2 to two or more conflicts. Figure 1 maps the 847 conflicts (circles) between 800 and 1799 along with the 676 cities (triangles) that we will exploit in this analysis.
4 Econometric analysis
4.1 Methodology
The linear specification that we estimate is
Pi,g,t = α + βCi,g,t−1 + μi + λt + γ ′Xi,g,t + i,g,t , (1)
where Pi,g,t is log population for city i in grid cell g at century t, Ci,g,t−1 is the conflict dummy that equals 1 if there was a military conflict in grid cell g over the previous century, μi and λt are city and century fixed effects, Xi,g,t is a vector of city-level controls that we will include in a robustness check, and i,g,t is a random error term.12 All standard errors are robust, clustered at the grid cell level to account for any within-grid serial correlation in
11 Table 2 shows the shares of sample cities and grid cells that saw (at least one) conflict by century. On average, 27 % of cities and 19 % of grid cells saw conflict over 800–1799. The smallest share of cities saw conflict over the tenth century (9 %), while the largest share saw conflict over the eighteenth century (54 %). Similarly, the smallest share of grid cells saw conflict over the tenth century (6 %), while the largest share saw conflict over the eighteenth century (43 %).
12 Thus, the first observation of Pi,g,t is for 900, because the first observation of Ci,g,t−1 measures conflict exposure over 800–99.

the error term.13 Table A1 of the online appendix displays the descriptive statistics for the regression variables. Our benchmark modeling approach accounts for unobserved features that may influence city population growth and conflict exposure alike. City fixed effects help account for initial conditions and time-invariant characteristics. Century fixed effects help account for widespread shocks. However, methodological challenges remain. A first concern is omitted variable bias. There may be unobserved time-varying factors that influence city population growth. We address this concern in several ways. First, we modify our benchmark model to include country-century interaction effects, which help account for changes in country-level variables, including total populations, urbanization rates, economic activity, and nation-state building. Second, we include grid cell-specific time trends, which help account for unobservable local features that change over time, including rural-urban wage differences and urban amenities. Third, we interact century fixed effects with a variety of observable time-invariant city characteristics, including Atlantic trade potential, soil quality, terrain ruggedness, and potato cultivation. Fourth, we control for observable time-varying city features, including urban networks, political institutions, university hosts, and bishop or archbishop seats. A second concern is reverse causation. As described, Glaeser and Shapiro (2002) identify a target effect whereby larger cities may be more attractive targets. We address this concern as follows. First, country-century interaction effects and grid-cell specific trends control for demographic trends at the national and local levels, respectively. Second, to further account for pre-existing trends and mean reversion effects, we include initial log city populationcentury interaction effects.14 Third, we perform placebo tests equal to the first lead of our variable of interest. Fourth, we regress (future) conflicts on lagged city populations.
4.2 Main results
Table 3 presents our estimates for the relationship between conflict exposure and city population growth. City fixed effects help account for initial conditions (economic, demographic, political, social) and local geographical features that may influence conflict patterns. Century fixed effects help control for common shocks across time. Column 1 shows the results for this benchmark specification. There is a significant relationship (at the 1 % level) between military conflicts that took place within the same 150 km × 150 km grid cell in which a city was located and city populations. Conflict exposure was associated with a 11 % average increase in city populations. City and century fixed effects help account for unobserved features that were constant for each city and across each century. To account for changes over time in country-level variables, column 2 adds country-century interaction effects. The estimate for conflict exposure is similar in magnitude and significance as the benchmark case. To control for unobserved factors that may have had time-varying local consequences for urbanization patterns (e.g.,
13 Table A15 of the online appendix shows the results when we adjust standard errors for spatial correlation according to Conley (1999) for the most stringent specification (i.e., column 4 of Table 3). To compute spatial correlation-adjusted standard errors, we follow the routine in Fetzer (2014), who extends Hsiang (2010). We assume that spatial correlation linearly decreases in the distance between each sample city up to cutoffs of 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500 km, respectively. The estimates for Ci,g,t−1 are unchanged, with p-values that range from 0.003 to 0.004. 14 Initial log city populations refer to the first available observation for each sample city.

the Black Death), column 3 adds grid cell-specific time trends. The result for conflict exposure remains significant; the point estimate falls to 6 %.15 City fixed effects help control for initial demographic conditions. Country-century interaction effects and grid-cell specific trends help control for national and local demographic trends, respectively. Still, it is possible that cities with larger or smaller initial populations grew at different rates. To control for pre-existing trends and mean reversion effects, column 4 adds initial log city population-century interaction effects. Including initial log city population-century interaction effects is a demanding way to account for pre-existing trends and mean reversion effects (Acemoglu et al. 2011). The estimate for Ci,g,t−1 is significant at the 5 % level, with a point estimate of 7 %. Overall, Table 3 shows evidence for a significant relationship that runs from conflict exposure to city population growth in Europe from the fall of Charlemagne’s empire to the start of the Industrial Revolution. The results are robust to a variety of checks for omitted variable bias and reverse causation.
5 Robustness
The evidence that we have shown in the previous section supports the argument that cities were safe harbors in European history. In this section, we use a variety of techniques to further test the robustness of our results. First, we control for a range of observable city
15 Table A3 of the online appendix shows the result for the most stringent specification (i.e., column 4 of Table 3) when we add city-specific time trends (rather than grid cell-specific time trends). The estimate for Ci,g,t−1 is 0.044, with p-value 0.083 (standard errors clustered at city level) or p-value 0.147 (standard errors clustered at grid-cell level). Given that our dependent variable Pi,g,t is in logs, the grid cell-specific (or city-specific) time trends capture exponential trends (Wooldridge 2009, p. 361). Still, Table A3 of the online appendix shows the results for the most stringent specification when we add a quadratic time trend at the city level or grid-cell level. For the former, the estimate for Ci,g,t−1 is 0.039, with p-value 0.139 (standard errors clustered at city level) or p-value 0.208 (standard errors clustered at grid-cell level). For the latter, the estimate for Ci,g,t−1 is 0.038, with p-value 0.165.

characteristics that may have influenced city population trends. Second, we perform placebo tests and other tests for a target effect. Finally, we assess how robust our estimates are to sample changes and an alternative conflict exposure measure.
5.1 Controls for observables
5.1.1 Atlantic trade
Acemoglu et al. (2005) show evidence that Atlantic traders (Britain, France, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain) saw significantly faster urbanization rates from 1500 onward. To account for the rise of Atlantic trade on city population growth, column 1 of Table 4 interacts Atlantic port cities with century dummies in the most stringent specification (i.e., column 4 of Table 3). The result for conflict exposure is robust to the inclusion of Atlantic port city-century interaction effects, with a point estimate of 7 %.16
5.1.2 Heavy plow
White (1962) and Andersen et al. (2015) argue that the breakthrough adoption of the heavy plow in 1000 led to greater urbanization in European regions with clay soils. To control for technological changes in agriculture on city population growth, column 2 of Table 4 interacts local soil quality according to Bosker et al. (2013) with century dummies. The soil quality data use climate information to calculate the probability that a region can be cultivated.17 The estimate for Ci,g,t−1 is similar in magnitude and significance to the previous specification.18
5.1.3 Potato cultivation
Nunn and Qian (2011) show that the introduction of the potato can account for a significant portion of urbanization in the Old World between 1700 and 1900. Similarly, Iyigun et al. (2010) find a negative relationship between the introduction of the potato and violent conflict in regions suitable to its cultivation. In the context of China, Jia (2014) shows that the introduction of the potato reduced the likelihood of peasant revolt in drought years. Column 3 of Table 4 interacts local soil suitability for potato cultivation with century dummies.19 The results for conflict exposure are again similar as before.
16 Given network effects, Atlantic trade may have been important for cities near, but not along, the Atlantic coast. Table A7 of the online appendix shows the result that interacts Atlantic coast grid cells with century fixed effects for the most stringent specification (i.e, column 4 of Table 3). The estimate for Ci,g,t−1 is 0.049, with p-value 0.076. This table also shows the result for Atlantic coast grid cells and neighboring grid cells. The estimate for Ci,g,t−1 is very similar as before. To account for Hanseatic trade, we code Hanseatic cities according to the list in Dollinger (1964, pp. ix–x). Table A7 of the online appendix shows the results that interact Hanseatic cities or Hanseatic grid cells with century fixed effects. The estimates for Ci,g,t−1 range from 0.068 to 0.069, with p-values that range from 0.027 to 0.029.
17 These data are available for grid cells of roughly 55 km × 40 km. Bosker et al. match the soil quality data to cities based on latitudes and longitudes.
18 Andersen et al. (2015) provide data on soil suitability for a plow-positive crop (barley) for NUTS2 units, which we match to sample cities in our database. We test three levels of barley suitability: (i) high, where Andersen et al.’s suitability index exceeds 70, (ii) good, where this index exceeds 55, and (iii) medium, where this index exceeds 40. Table A14 of the online appendix shows the results when we interact soil suitability for barley with century fixed effects for the most stringent specification (i.e., column 4 of Table 3). The estimates for Ci,g,t−1 range from 0.069 to 0.072, with p-values that range from 0.034 to 0.045.
19 To construct the potato suitability data, we follow the Nunn-Qian procedure. First, we match the GIS raster file with global coverage of soil suitability for potato cultivation to each 150 km × 150 km grid

272 J Econ Growth (2016) 21:259–282
5.1.4 Ruggedness
Hohenberg and Lees (1995) note that, for defensive purposes, city locations were often in difficult-to-reach places. Column 4 of Table 4 interacts local terrain ruggedness, another geographical feature from Bosker et al. (2013), with century dummies. The ruggedness data calculate the standard deviation of the elevation of the terrain that surrounds each sample city for a radius of 10 km. The estimate for conflict exposure is robust to the inclusion of ruggedness-century interaction effects.
5.1.5 Other geographic features
The local returns to time-invariant geographical features may change over time. For example, improvements to maritime technology may have changed the returns to sea or river locations. Column 5 of Table 4 interacts the variables from columns 1–4 (Atlantic ports, soil quality, soil suitability for potato cultivation, and ruggedness) along with a variety of other local geographic characteristics (seaports, riverports, Roman road hubs, and elevations above sea level) with century fixed effects.20 The result for conflict exposure is similar in magnitude and significance as before.
5.1.6 Time-varying city-level features
Distances to other cities may influence urbanization patterns. City fixed effects control for distances between cities. Grid-cell specific trends help control for changes in urban networks and transportation technology over time. As an additional way to account for urban clusters, we control for the number of cities with populations of at least 10,000 that were located within 100 km of each sample city per century. To account for political institutions, we include a dummy variable for whether a city was a self-governing commune each century. To account for education, we include a dummy variable for whether a city hosted a university each century. To account for religion, we control for whether a city was a bishop or archbishop seat each century. We code the city-level variables according to Bosker et al. (2013).21 Column 6 of Table 4 adds these time-varying city-level controls. The estimate for Ci,g,t−1 remains significant; the point estimate falls to 5 %. Dense urban networks and self-governing communes were associated with significant increases in city populations. Column 7 of Table 4 includes the interaction terms from columns 1 to 5 (Atlantic ports, soil quality, soil suitability for potato cultivation, ruggedness, and local geography) along with the city-level controls. The estimate for conflict exposure is similar in magnitude and significance to the previous specification.
5.2 Placebo tests
To this point, we have shown evidence for a robust relationship that runs from conflict exposure to city population growth. To further test the strength of this relationship, we create
Footnote 19 continued cell in our database. There are five categories of potato suitability: (i) very suitable land, (ii) suitable land, (iii) moderately suitable land, (iv) marginally suitable land, and (v) unsuitable land. Nunn and Qian define land to be suitable for potato cultivation if it falls within categories (i) to (iii). Finally, we define potato suitability as Potatoi,g ≡ ln(1 + Potato Ar eai,g).
20 The data for the other geographic variables are from Bosker et al. (2013).
21 Note that these variables are “bad” controls (Angrist and Pischke 2009) in the sense that they themselves may be outcomes of military conflict.

a conflict exposure placebo equal to the first lead of our exposure measure. For example, if the dependent variable Pi,g,t measures log population for city i in grid cell g in 1500, then the conflict exposure placebo measures conflict exposure over 1500–1599 (in contrast to the original conflict exposure measure Ci,g,t−1, which measures conflict exposure over 1400-1499). If the placebo coefficient is not significant, then this analysis will provide further evidence in favor of our preferred interpretation of the results. Column 1 of Table 5 shows the result for the one-century conflict exposure placebo for the most stringent specification. The point estimate for the conflict exposure placebo is 0.036; the p-value is 0.281. For comparison, if we estimate this specification for the original conflict exposure measure for the same set of observations as for the placebo sample, the point estimate (0.072) is twice the size of the placebo estimate and is highly significant (not shown). Column 2 shows the result when we exclude the capital city and largest city today for each sample country. The point estimate for the conflict exposure placebo is now 0.027; the p-value is 0.423. Excluding the largest 10 sample cities (column 3) or 20 sample cities (column 4) each century between 800 and 1800 does not change the placebo test results, either. Glaeser and Shapiro (2002, p. 211) note that a target effect was less likely if a city had the military strength to protect its wealth. Column 5 shows the result when we restrict the sample to cities that were ever self-governing communes, where military strength was likely to have been greater (Shultz and Weingast 1998; Stasavage 2011). Consistent with Glaeser and Shapiro’s claim, the point estimate for the conflict exposure placebo falls to 0.010; the p-value rises to 0.789. Overall, the placebo tests reinforce our preferred interpretation of the results.
5.3 Target effect test
We control for demographic trends in several ways (e.g., country-century interaction effects, grid-cell specific trends, initial log city population-century interaction effects). To explicitly test for the target effect, we regress the conflict exposure measure Ci,g,t−1 on lagged city populations. For example, if the dependent variable Ci,g,t−1 measures conflict exposure over
123


274 J Econ Growth (2016) 21:259–282
1400-1499, then Pi,g,t−1 measures lagged log city populations in 1400. This test is a way to evaluate whether larger cities are more attractive targets. Column 1 of Table 6 shows the results of this analysis for the most stringent specification when the independent variable is Pi,g,t−1. Column 2 repeats this test when the independent variables are Pi,g,t−1 and Pi,g,t−2. The coefficients for lagged city populations are not significant in either specification. Columns 3–6 show the results when we exclude (i) the capital city and largest city today for each sample country (column 3), (ii) the largest 10 sample cities each century (column 4), (iii) the largest 20 sample cities each century (column 5), or (iv) non self-governing communes (column 6). Relative to the first two columns, the coefficients for lagged city populations are smaller and the p-values are larger in columns 3, 4, and 6, and of similar size in column 5.22 This exercise provides further evidence that the target effect does not drive our results.23
5.4 Alternative samples
5.4.1 Exclude Britain
Country-century interaction effects and grid-cell specific trends control for unobserved timevarying factors at the national and local levels, respectively. To further control for the influence of early industrialization, column 1 of Table 7 excludes British (along with Irish) cities for the most stringent specification. The results for conflict exposure are robust to this sample change.24
5.4.2 Exclude capitals
To test for the importance of capital status, column 2 of Table 7 excludes grid cell-centuries that contain a historical sovereign capital city according to Bosker et al. (2013). The estimate for Ci,g,t−1 remains significant at the 1 % level, with a point estimate of 11 %.25
22 To test whether larger cities were more attractive targets over the short term, Table A12 of the online appendix shows the results of the target effect test when we regress the conflict exposure measure Ci,g,t−1 on lagged city populations Pi,g,t−1, where Ci,g,t−1 now equals 1 if there was a military conflict in grid cell
g over the first z years of century t, where z = 10, 20, 30, 40, 50. The coefficients for Pi,g,t−1 are never significant.
23 In the online appendix, we account for the target effect in another way, by including the lagged dependent variable and re-running the specifications from Table 3. Including the lagged dependent variable induces Nickell bias (Nickell 1981), particularly if the panel’s time dimension T is small (for our sample, T = 8). Still, Table A6 shows the main results when we include lagged log city population as a control. The estimates for Ci,g,t−1 range from 0.048 to 0.080, with p-values that range from 0.005 to 0.140 (we lose 20 % of observations). For comparison, the original estimates range from 0.063 to 0.113, with p-values that range from 0.004 to 0.055. Thus, including lagged log city population does not change the main results by much. To address Nickell bias, we can use GMM estimation (Arellano and Bond 1991). However, GMM requires strong assumptions (Angrist and Pischke 2009, p. 245). Namely, GMM uses past differenced lags to instrument for the lagged dependent variable; it is unlikely that past differenced lags are not correlated with the differenced residuals. Still, Table A13 shows the main results when we use GMM. The estimates for Ci,g,t−1 range from 0.024 to 0.062, with p-values that range from 0.013 to 0.321 (we lose more than 35 % of observations).
24 Figure A1 of the online appendix shows the results for the most stringent specification (i.e., column 4 of Table 3) when we exclude each country one by one (there are 26 countries). The estimates for Ci,g,t−1 range from 0.044 to 0.077, with p-values that range from 0.014 to 0.098 (24 of 26 p-values are less than 0.050). The lowest point estimate (0.044) occurs when we exclude Spain. Still, this estimate remains significant at the 10 % level. Over the medieval period, Christian rulers expelled Muslim invaders from Spain (the Reconquista). To defend newly recaptured territory, such rulers established fortified cities. To promote repopulation, they often granted individual freedoms to new urban inhabitants (O’Callaghan 2002, pp. 699–700).
25 Furthermore, excluding the capital city and largest city today for each sample country does not change the main results.

5.4.3 Exclude centuries
The 1700s saw over 35 % of all sample conflicts. To further test—beyond century fixed effects—the influence of eighteenth-century conflicts, column 3 of Table 7 restricts the sample to conflicts from 800 to 1699. The estimate for conflict exposure on city populations is similar as before. Scholars including Tilly (1992), Parker (1996), and Gennaioli and Voth (2014) focus on the early modern era (from the fifteenth century onward) as a particularly important era of military conflict and state-building in Europe. Column 4 of Table 7 shows the result for this era. The estimate for Ci,g,t−1 remains robust.26
5.5 Alternative conflict exposure measure
Our benchmark measure for conflict exposure is a dummy variable. As described in Sect. 3, the dummy approach makes sense because 90 % of grid cell-centuries saw 0 or 1 conflicts from 800 to 1799. 95 % of grid cell-centuries saw 0, 1, or 2 conflicts from 800 to 1799. Thus,
26 The estimate for conflict exposure is positive but no longer significant when we restrict the conflict sample to the pre-early modern era (e.g., column 4 of Table A5 of the online appendix). Tilly (1992), Parker (1996), and Gennaioli and Voth (2014) highlight the importance of new urban fortifications in early modern Europe called the trace italienne. New fortifications may have reduced the probability of wartime urban destruction. For example, Bosker et al. (2013) provide data for the number of times that a sample city was plundered each century. Between the start of the ninth century and the end of the twelfth century, sample cities were plundered 105 times. However, between the start of the fifteenth century and the end of the eighteenth century, sample cities were only plundered 65 times. Furthermore, the most plundering (61 times) took place over the ninth century, while the least plundering (5 times) took place over the eighteenth century. This evidence suggests that post-fifteenth century improvements in defensive structures may have reduced the likelihood of wartime urban destruction, which may help explain why our results suggest that the safe harbor effect was more important during the early modern era than before. A related explanation is that the safe harbor effect may have become more important after the Black Death and the emergence of a post-Malthusian economy. Greater per capita income translated into greater tax revenues, which (i) increased the likelihood of military conflict (Voigtländer and Voth 2013a, b) and (ii) may have increased the ability of polities to construct new fortifications, thereby reducing the likelihood of wartime urban destruction. This explanation is consistent with the result in column 5 of Table 5, which shows that a target effect was less likely if a city had the military strength to protect its wealth.

as an alternative, we construct an ordered variable that takes a value of 0 for each century that a grid cell saw 0 conflicts, a value of 1 for one conflict, and a value of 2 for two or more conflicts. Table 8 shows the results for the ordered variable approach. The results are robust to this alternative conflict exposure measure.27
5.6 Summary
Overall, the robustness checks described in this section reinforce the validity of our main result, namely that there is a strong and significant relationship that runs from conflict exposure to city population growth in European history.

In this section, we present further evidence for the safe harbor effect. This evidence takes two forms. First, we distinguish between conflict types. Second, we offer evidence from the historical literature on city walls.
6.1 Conflict types
Battles and sieges comprise 94 % of our historical conflict data. Battles typically took place in the countryside or hinterland, whereas sieges typically took place just outside (and sometimes within) cities. Table 9 restricts the conflict sample to battles only (column 1) or sieges only (column 2) for the most stringent specification. For battles only, the estimate for Ci,g,t−1
27 Table A10 of the online appendix shows the result for the most stringent specification (i.e., column 4 of Table 3) when we use the number of conflicts and the squared number of conflicts as our variables of interest. The estimate for Ci,g,t−1 is 0.023, with p-value 0.051. The estimate for the quadratic term is −0.001, with p-value 0.118. The coefficient for the quadratic term is negative. However, (i) the magnitude is very small and (ii) the negative effect does not apply until 12 conflicts are reached. This number is large; nearly all sample cities were exposed to less conflict over 800–1799.

is highly significant, with a point estimate of 0.065. For sieges only, however, the estimate for Ci,g,t−1 is not significant, with a smaller point estimate (0.034). We believe that this evidence on conflict types is consistent with the safe harbor effect, because it suggests that, as our argument would predict, the safe harbor effect was stronger for conflicts that took place in the countryside or hinterland than for conflicts that took place just outside cities, which could cause greater urban destruction (and therefore less city population growth).
6.2 Evidence from city walls
Fortified stone walls did not surround every city in medieval and early modern Europe (Tracy 2000a, pp. 3–4, Tracy 2000b, p. 77).28 For example, Tracy (2000b, Table 3.7) estimates that 576 of 1,083 (or, 53 %) of cities in Germany were walled between Roman times and 1800.29 The cost to erect fortified stone walls in terms of labor and materials was large (Tracy 2000a, p. 3). For example, the basic fourteenth-century wall at Leiden in the Netherlands took 50 million bricks to build (Tracy 2000b, p. 71). Fourteenth-century Lille, which (Wolfe 2009, p. 65) labels a “typical” French case, spent 50 % of yearly revenues on construction and maintenance costs for its city walls. Tracy (2000a, b) argues that improved security was the main reason why some city leaders decided to pay the price and erect fortified walls, writing (p. 3): “No matter how ’natural’ it may have seemed for a town to have walls, the sheer labor and expense involved means that wall builders must have had compelling reasons. Most often, it was a matter of defense against anticipated attack.” Reyerson (2000, p. 89) and Wolfe (2009, p. 60–61) claim that the beginning of the Hundred Years’ War (1337–1453) was associated with significant wall-building efforts by French cities. Similarly, Wolfe (2000, p. 328) argues that the start of the French Wars of Religion (1562–1598) began a “frenzy” of wall-building activity. It is difficult to systematically assess which cities were walled in medieval and early modern Europe (Tracy 2000b, p. 77). Germany is the best documented case (Tracy 2000b, p.
28 As described in Sect. 2, a city without fortified walls could still have outer rings of conjoined dwellings that functioned as barriers, or could have defensive palisades or ramparts, or be situated in a naturally protected location, thereby enabling small groups of defenders to fend off larger groups of attackers.
29 Tracy’s definition of “walled city” counts single or double stone walls, gun platforms placed outside of walls, and bastioned traces, but excludes defensive palisades and ramparts.

77). Tracy (2000b, Table 3.7) estimates the share of walled cities in total cities for historical German provinces. We combine the Tracy data on walled cities with data on conflict exposure between 800 and 1799 according to modern German states, which overlap with historical provinces.30 To compute our measure of conflict exposure, we sum the number of conflicts within each modern German state over this period. We then scale this number by the area of each modern German state. Figure 2 indicates that there is a positive relationship between warfare and walled cities in German history. Rhineland, the province with the most historical conflict exposure (0.55), has the second-highest share of walled cities (51 out of 73, or 70 %). By contrast, Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein, the provinces with the least historical conflict exposure, have the lowest shares of walled cities. This evidence suggests that, as the safe harbor effect would predict, the historical relationship between warfare and city walls is positive. Furthermore, Tracy (2000b, Tables 3.4–3.6) shows that the percentage of walled cities was relatively high (35–43 %) among very small cities (less than 1000 inhabitants), which suggests that security was a main function of city walls, even if there was not much wealth to protect. Overall, while we still cannot rule out the roles of the rural poverty effect or the Malthusian effect to explain the historical relationship between military conflict and city population growth, the evidence that we present in this section provides further evidence for the safe harbor effect.
7 Conclusion
This paper presents new evidence about the relationship between military conflict and city population growth in Europe from the fall of Charlemagne’s empire to the start of the Indus
30 The mappings from historical provinces to modern German states are approximations. Tracy presents data for eleven historical provinces, of which we exclude two (East Prussia and Silesia) that do not fall within the borders of modern Germany. Of the nine historical provinces that we include, we map Anhalt to the modern state of Saxony-Anhalt, Brandenburg to Brandenburg, Hesse to Hesse, Meckenburg and Pomerania to Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Rhineland to Rhineland-Palatinate, Saxony (or, Old Saxony) to Lower Saxony, Schleswig-Holstein to Schleswig-Holstein, and Thuringia to Thuringia.

trial Revolution. Military conflict was a defining feature of European history. Our argument follows a distinguished line of scholars that view historical cities as safe harbors from conflict threats. To test our argument, we perform an econometric analysis on a novel database that spans 1000 years. Our analysis accounts for potential biases from omitted variables and reverse causation. We show evidence for a positive, significant, and robust relationship that runs from conflict exposure to city population growth. Our estimates indicate that conflict exposure was associated with a 6–11 % average increase in city populations. To the best of our knowledge, our paper is among the first to provide systematic evidence that military conflicts played a key role in the rise of urban Europe. Does the legacy of historical conflict persist? Systematic study of the long-run consequences of historical conflict for urban prosperity in Europe is an exciting topic for future work.
