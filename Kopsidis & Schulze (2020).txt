Introduction
This chapter explores the patterns of economic growth, stagnation and structural change in 19th-century Central, East and Southeast Europe. Throughout the period, this extremely diverse part of the European continent – in terms of geography, language, culture, religion and political organization – remained economically far less developed and far more dependent on agriculture than its northern and north-western counterparts. Though industrialization gathered momentum in the latter half of the century, the pace of economic change across the region as a whole was insufficient to narrow the substantial income and developmental gap to the more advanced Western economies evident already in the early decades of the century. There was no catching-up of the East with the West. If anything, the region was falling further behind not just the richest or fastest growing countries but also Europe outside of the region taken together. On the eve of the First World War, average domestic product per head of the six economies considered here – Austria, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Romania and Russia – had declined from about 36 per cent of the United Kingdom’s level in 1870 to less than one-third. Relative to the region’s German neighbour, the decrease was from almost 60 per cent to little more than 40 per cent, while the comparative income position vis-à-vis Europe as a whole deteriorated by about 13 points to 47 per cent.1 However, this broad-brush picture of relative decline masks important differences between and within the economies of the region. These differences extend inter alia to the level and rates of growth of aggregate and per capita output, the sectoral structure of the economies, their resource endowments, the timing of their industrialization and the nature and role of institutional change. Much of Central, East-Central and Southeast Europe was under Habsburg rule until the end of the

First World War. The empire’s geographical location, ‘straddling the dividing line between Inner and peripheral Europe’ (Pollard 1986: 222), meant that the timing, speed and spatial diffusion of growth and industrialization there reflected many of the features characteristic of the broader European experience, including far-reaching regional differences (Klein et al. 2017). It was the Habsburg domains closest to Western Europe, Alpine Austria and the Czech lands that first proved responsive to the ‘growth impulses from England and of the continental northwest’ (Good 1984: 15) and where modern manufacturing first began to replace proto-industrial forms of production in the late 18th and early 19th centuries (Good 1984; Komlos 1983, 1989). These parts of the Habsburg realm were economically in as promising a position as the territories of Germany (Freudenberger 2003) – for instance, in the 1820s Austrian per capita incomes were at least on a par with those in Germany. While that advantage was to be eroded very rapidly over the second half of the 19th century and in relation to the continent’s West and North-West (Klein et al. 2017; Schulze 2000, 2007a), the Habsburg Empire, including a Hungarian economy that was expanding comparatively fast after 1870, maintained a position of economic leadership in Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe. Elsewhere in the region comparable advances were at best muted in the first two-thirds of the century, meaning that any progress made in later decades would be on the basis of low initial levels of economic activity. The following three sections map out and evaluate the record of macro-economic and sectoral change in the region. First, and in light of the data problems pertaining to the area compared to most Western economies, we set out briefly the territorial coverage of the chapter and the main data sources used to trace the region’s and its constituent economies’ trajectory over the 19th century. The next section is concerned with documenting economies’ growth, the growth differentials between them and their sectoral origins. In a sense, it sets out the explanandum. Section 4 explores sectoral developments in some detail, followed by a conclusion that summarizes the main findings and points to some major implications for the interpretation of economic growth and development in the region up to the First World War.
Coverage and data
The available quantitative evidence on aggregate and sectoral growth in the region is uneven across the six economies with regards to period coverage, estimation methods and underlying data quality. Reasonably solid measures of macroeconomic and sectoral activity that can be employed for comparative purposes are available only from mid-century onwards. David Good (1984) referred to the ‘statistical dark age’ that, for a time, hampered quantitative analysis of economic development in the Habsburg Empire. By extension, one might say, this applies even more so to the broader region that is of interest here. Of course, to a significant extent this is to do with political history – Bulgaria gained autonomy only in 1878 and independence


Economic growth and sectoral developments 41
from the Ottoman Empire as late as 1908, while Romania became an independent state in 1877. As a result, relevant statistical source materials for the decades prior to the foundation of nation-states are either not existing or not as readily accessible as they have been for many or most of the Western economies. In short, we know a lot more about the quantitative aspects of economic growth after the 1850s or 1860s than the preceding decades. For an assessment of Russia’s economic trajectory, the paucity of pre-1860 data raises serious issues, too. Thus it is difficult to identify and measure the quantitative impact of the emancipation of the serfs in 1861 on growth and structural change when fairly little is known about aggregate output and productivity changes before. The following discussion draws on recent time series estimates of national product and its main sectoral components for Bulgaria, Greece, the Habsburg Empire (Imperial Austria and Imperial Hungary), Romania and Tsarist Russia in their 1913 borders. The emphasis is necessarily on the years after mid-century. While not comprehensive in the sense of covering every economy in the region leaving aside, for instance, Serbia and the European part of the Ottoman Empire this country sample captures most of the population and economic activity at the aggregate level of Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe.2 The output series for Austria and Hungary are taken from Schulze (2000); for 1870–1913, only minor corrections have been made that do not materially affect estimated sector and aggregate growth. The gross domestic product (GDP) series has been extended backwards to 1840 using sector-specific indices from Kausel (1979) and Komlos (1983). For Bulgaria and 1870–1913, the discussion relies on Ivanov’s recent (2012) GDP estimates, correcting for a minor mismatch between GDP in current and constant 1911 prices in the 1911 base year and normalizing for the population within the country’s 1911 (i.e. pre-Balkan Wars) borders throughout. The data on Greece and their use here require some more explanation. Kostelenos et al. (2007) provide annual estimates of nominal and constant (1914) price domestic product in historical boundaries which, however, changed significantly over the course of the century with the acquisition of new territory. Without adjustment, these data do not lend themselves to the purpose of growth measurement. We first revised their original real GDP series using a smoothed deflator3 and then adjusted this amended GDP series and the corresponding population series, taking account not just of the increase in size but also the variation in output per capita that each border change involved. Finally, the new GDP and population series have been used to derive real GDP per capita for Greece in her pre-Balkan Wars borders.4 Axenciuc (2012) has produced a new annual estimate of Romania’s domestic product for 1860 to 1913. In the following, we draw on his series of gross value added in constant 1913 prices but re-allocated the output of largely part-time domestic industry from manufacturing to the agricultural sector. This helps avoid an over-estimation of manufacturing’s size relative to other economies where these


42 Michael Kopsidis and Max-Stephan Schulze
hard-to-observe and predominantly rural economic activities have either not been recorded at all or counted as part of agriculture, as in Ivanov (2012). For Russia, a new aggregate output series has been constructed for 1861–1913. Gregory (1982) offers annual series of net national product in current and constant 1913 prices for 1885–1913, which have been estimated from the expenditure side, as well as spot estimates of gross value added by sector for 1883/1887 and 1909/1913. The latter estimates have been reworked by Allen (2003), replacing Gregory’s underlying industrial output series. However, this material does not allow assessing the rates of growth and structural change prior to the early 1880s and on an annual basis. We have, therefore, compiled a new annual series of GDP at constant 1913 prices that is based on sectoral gross value added and stretching back to 1861. The starting point is Gregory (1982) and Allen (2003), whose common 1913 sectoral value added levels have been projected backwards, drawing on Goldsmith (1961) for agriculture (crops and livestock) and Suhara (2006) for industrial output, crafts and construction, while trade, transport and communications have been estimated using a weighted index of commodity output.5 Together, these sectoral components of GDP accounted for over 90 per cent of Russian GDP in 1913. Output of the remaining service sector branches has been approximated as a residual. The new annual GDP results match well with Allen’s (2003) and Gregory’s (1982) spot estimates for 1885 and 1899.6 To facilitate cross-country level comparisons, all GDP and GDP per capita data are expressed in 1990 international dollars.7

the second largest economy in Europe in terms of total GDP, just behind Germany, and ahead of the United Kingdom, France and the Habsburg Empire (Table 3.1; Broadberry and Klein 2012). This was the outcome of rapid aggregate growth over the course of the late 19th century and, in particular, from the mid-1880s. However, much of Russia’s growth was extensive, driven by an exceptionally fast increase of her population which expanded from an initially already much higher level than that of her European peers (Table 3.2). The result was slow growth in Russia’s per capita output (Tables 3.3 and 3.4). In the region, only Bulgaria, another economy characterized by rapid population expansion, did worse with almost stagnating per capita incomes, albeit against a background of comparatively weak aggregate growth to start with.8 This is in stark contrast to the evidence from Hungary and Romania. Both economies displayed comparatively strong per capita income growth at or above the European average but differed significantly in terms of population growth. These two were the only two Eastern European economies that by 1913 had narrowed the initial 1860 income gap to the region’s richest economy (Austria), at least in percentage if not in absolute terms (Table 3.3). The long-run performance of Greece falls somewhere in the middle of the sample. While aggregate growth there was marginally faster than in Hungary, the more rapid expansion of the population meant that per capita income grew only at a rate similar to Austria’s. How does the growth performance of the Eastern and South-Eastern economies compare within the broader European context? Significant intra-region income level and growth differentials notwithstanding, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe on the whole fell further behind in terms of per capita income during the 19th century. This holds not just vis-à-vis the UK, Europe’s leading economy, or the region’s rapidly industrializing German neighbour but also – and more tellingly – other initially less developed economies on the continent’s southern and northern ‘peripheries’ (Table 3.3). In 1870, average per capita GDP across the region was about $1,178 in 1990 purchasing power parity (PPP)-adjusted terms (1860: $1,108). Its subsequent growth up to 1913 (0.76 per cent per annum) is well below the record for any of the northern and southern economies (except

Portugal), irrespective of their initial comparative income levels. Of course, part of this is an effect of Russia’s weight in the calculation. However, growth at rates broadly comparable to those prevailing in the Nordic countries was achieved only in Hungary and Romania; elsewhere in the region, per capita incomes rose at rates below those in Italy and Spain. Economic growth in the region was a process characterized by pronounced annual fluctuations in activity and, in some instances, longer phases of expansion alternating with periods of stagnation (Figure 3.1). Greece and Romania experienced particularly strong year-on-year variations in per capita output throughout the period. Like Bulgaria and Russia, the Greek economy faced extended episodes of slow growth below 0.5 per cent per annum. For those economies where the available data allow comparison with earlier decades, the numbers indicate a significant increase in per capita output growth in the years after 1870. The timing of these up-swings in activity, however, varied markedly between countries. As a means to more clearly identify the periodicity of economic growth and to avoid the distortions brought about by measuring output changes between points

in time that are unsystematically related to the business cycle, we compute growth from peak-to-peak in per capita GDP (Table 3.4). The impression of Hungarian and Romanian growth as particularly strong in the given regional context is confirmed, and so is that of a comparatively weak record for Bulgaria and Russia. After a period of slow growth in the 1870s and 1880s, Greek GDP per capita growth rose in the 1890s and early 1900s, though not nearly enough to keep pace with the most dynamic economies in the region. Note the reversal in growth fortunes between Austria and Hungary in the late 1880s/early 1890s. This had to do with the effects of the ‘Great Depression’ after 1873. Both the periodicity and differential rates of Austrian and Hungarian growth support the argument that the outflow of Austrian capital to Hungary after the 1873 Vienna stock market crash was crucial in prolonging slow growth in the western half of the Habsburg Empire, whilst stimulating the first wave of industrialization in the eastern, Hungarian half. The reversal of this capital outflow in the early 1890s was associated with an increase in Austrian and a decrease in Hungarian economic growth (Komlos 1983; Schulze 1996, 1997, 2000). Russia’s post-1890 doubling in per capita GDP growth reflects the onset of modern industrialization which Markevich and Nafziger (2017: 37) locate in the early 1890. To what extent was economic growth in Eastern Europe associated with changes in the income distribution among the region’s economies? One can think about the issue in terms of so-called σ-convergence – a reduction over time in the

dispersion of per capita income levels across economies (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1991; Sala-i-Martin 1996). A typical measure of σ-convergence is the coefficient of variation. A decline in the coefficient is indicative of a fall in dispersion. Figure 3.2 documents two measures: CVI, which covers all sample economies except Bulgaria, and CVII where Bulgaria is included.9 Though there are minor differences in dispersion levels, the two measures tell in essence the same story: while fluctuating strongly over time, there is no uniform linear trend decline or rise. At the end of the period under review, the extent of inter-country inequality in terms of GDP per capita was more or less the same as in 1870 – there is no evidence of sustained σ-convergence in late 19th Eastern and South-Eastern Europe. However, one can nevertheless distinguish three major phases, driven by the six economies’ different periodicities and rates of expansion. During the 1870s and up to the late 1880s, income dispersion declined to its overall lowest level. This decline was associated with low-income economies – especially Hungary and Romania, but also Greece – recording significantly higher per capita growth than Austria and moving in percentage terms somewhat closer to the richest economy in the sample. This shift was reversed in the 1890s when Austria began expanding at the fastest rate and increasing its income lead. There was some reduction in income dispersion again towards the very end of the period, but that did not entail any significant decline below its 1870 level. The concept of β-convergence offers a different, but related, perspective on the convergence problem. The hypothesis is that poor economies will tend to catch up with and grow faster than rich ones, with all economies converging eventually in terms of per capita income.10 Low-income countries have the potential to grow faster than more developed, richer countries because they are not faced with as rapidly diminishing returns to capital as high-income and capitalrich economies. In addition, poor economies can potentially adopt and adapt the

technologies, production methods and institutions that are typical features of the leading, rich economies.11 Though a necessary condition, β-convergence is not a sufficient condition for σ-convergence (Young et al. 2008). The most basic variant of testing for unconditional convergence involves regressing the growth rate of real income per capita over a given period on the initial income level at the start of the period. An inverse relation between the growth rate and initial income implies poorer economies are growing faster and catching up with the rich. Figure 3.3 illustrates this relationship for our sample of Eastern European economies. While the slope is negative, suggesting some catching-up of the poor with the rich across the region, this evidence is weak. It lends little, if any, support to the notion of intra-regional convergence. Leaving aside the small number of observations, the fit of the regression line is poor and the estimated coefficient on initial income is statistically insignificant. The question that now arises is to what extent the stark differences in aggregate performance between the six economies were driven by differences in sector growth and economic structure. The data in Table 3.5 combine these two aspects to assess the relative contribution that the primary, secondary and tertiary sectors made to GDP growth.12 Relative growth contributions are measured as each sector’s growth rate weighted by its share in GDP at the beginning of the period. Both panels (A. 1840–1870, B. 1870s–1910s) reflect the different timing and pace of countries’ industrialization. Apart from Imperial Austria and especially its western and northern lands, the region industrialized late in European comparison (Klein et al. 2017; Pollard 1986: 191–251).

broadly, secondary sector – base upon which Austria’s subsequent expansion built was far larger than anywhere else in the region in the early 19th century.13 Hence during 1840–1870, more than 57 per cent of the increase in total value added was the result of growth in the secondary sector, though slow expansion in agriculture played a role, too, in shifting the balance towards industry. This contrasts with the Greek experience. Our approximation would suggest that expansion in non-farm goods production there was about twice as fast as in Austria during this period; however, it left much less of a mark on GDP growth, contributing about 25 per cent – a reflection of the secondary sector’s extremely small initial size (Table 3.6).14 Here, as in Hungary, it was agriculture where most of aggregate growth was generated. The richer evidence on the post-1870 period allows drawing a more detailed and nuanced picture of sectoral growth across the region. The case of Bulgaria marks one end of the range of Eastern and South-Eastern Europe’s growth and industrialization experiences. Whatever catch-up potential its economy might have had in the early 1870s, Bulgaria realized little if any of that potential. The country’s small and only slowly growing secondary sector made an almost negligible contribution of a mere 5 per cent to aggregate growth (Table 3.5, lower panel) and over time assumed a falling share in aggregate output (Table 3.6). Further, structural change in terms of significant shifts in the sectoral composition of the labour force was practically absent (Table 3.7). On the eve of the First World War, Bulgaria was hardly more industrialized than it had been 40 years earlier and, compared to the rest of the region, had become relatively poorer. If there is a place in the region where Palairet’s (1997) dictum of evolution without development might apply, it would be Bulgaria (and, perhaps even more so, Serbia). The pattern of development was distinctly different in the region’s fastest growing economy in terms of both total and per capita GDP – Romania. Starting off from an income per head level in 1870 that was well below Bulgaria’s (if the conversions in 1990 international dollars are about right in comparative terms) and, likewise, a much lower initial secondary sector share in GDP, the output structure of the Romanian economy changed significantly over the late 19th century (Table 3.6). By 1913, the proportion of GDP generated in mining, manufacturing, crafts and construction had more than doubled to 23 per cent and the sector contributed almost a quarter of total GDP growth since the 1870s, while expansion in services added about 38 per cent. In Greece, the secondary sector made a similar contribution to aggregate growth. However, reliance on expansion in primary production remained far larger in comparative terms than in Romania, with the sector contributing half of total output growth and accounting for as much as 59 per cent of Greek GDP in 1913. The persistent dominance of agriculture was also characteristic of development in the region’s largest economy. Despite Russia’s rapid industrialization from the early 1890s, in particular, it was mainly its huge rural sector that shaped aggregate growth into the early 20th century. In 1870, more than 80 per cent of the total

Economic growth and sectoral developments 51
labour force were engaged in agriculture (including forestry and fishing), which generated about 64 per cent of the economy’s total output (Tables 3.6 and 3.7). Between the early 1870s and early 1910s, the primary sector contributed over 42 per cent of the increase in GDP – significantly more than mining, manufacturing, crafts and construction put together. Such numbers raise the issue of how ’industrialized’ the region had become before the First World War. In this respect, comparisons with the Habsburg Empire, especially Imperial Austria, as a benchmark are particularly instructive precisely because it straddled the boundaries between Europe’s industrial core and its eastern periphery. Austria was the only economy in Central, Eastern and SouthEastern Europe where it was not agriculture but industry that made the largest sector contribution to economic growth (about 10 percentage points higher than in Hungary and Russia; Table 3.5). Further, nowhere else in the region was the share of the secondary sector in total economy output nearly as high as in Austria, either at the beginning or end of the period under review.15 Reflecting both far higher levels of labour productivity and a far higher proportion of the labour force employed in non-agricultural goods production, secondary sector output per head of the population in Austria remained at more than twice the level of the closest followers (Hungary, Romania, Russia) throughout the period. Finally, manufacturing in Austria and, to a lesser extent, Hungary, as distinct from mining, handicrafts and construction, played proportionally a much bigger role than in the rest of the region.16 In short, despite rapid industrial growth in Greece, Romania and Russia during the late 19th century, on the eve of the First World War the countries of Eastern and South-Eastern Europe remained heavily dependent on agriculture and, compared to Austria and even more so its Western peers, a long way off from becoming ‘industrial’ economies.
Growth without structural change
Between 1860 and 1914, no other part of Europe experienced a higher rate of population growth than South-East Europe, where demographic stagnation turned into a sustained expansion (Jackson 1985: 223–272; Botev 1990). In the Tsarist Empire, population growth doubled from 0.96 per cent (1719–1782) to 1.94 per cent (1897–1914) (Mironov 2000: 18). The demographic boom was significantly weaker but still noticeable in the Habsburg Empire, the most economically developed part of the region (Table 3.2). Even if the interdependencies of 19th-century demographic and economic growth – which differed between and changed over time within countries – are far from clear for Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, we can be reasonably confident that the sustained demographic upswing was only possible because growth in economic activity in the region had begun to accelerate well before 1870. The evidence on per capita output growth suggests that almost the entire region participated in the international economic upswing of the ‘first globalization’,


52 Michael Kopsidis and Max-Stephan Schulze
albeit to very different degrees at the individual economy level. However, even during the period of accelerating growth after 1870, which also saw the beginning of industrialization in the lands east and southeast of Imperial Austria, there was no catching-up to the leading industrial nations in Western Europe. Despite high growth rates in manufacturing and transport, structural change was painfully slow and little headway was made in the transition from agricultural to industrial economies and societies. On the eve of the First World War, primary production (agriculture, forestry and fishing) still formed by far the largest economic sector across Eastern and South-Eastern Europe except Imperial Austria (Table 3.6).17 The dominance of agriculture is put into even sharper relief when looking at sectoral labour force shares. Apart from Greece with her large maritime sector and Imperial Austria, across the region agriculture still counted for no less than 70 per cent of the total labour force in 1910 (Table 3.6). Even after three to four decades of industrialization efforts and growth in manufacturing and transport, the proportion of labour engaged in farming remained far higher in most East and South-East European countries than in the early industrializing countries of the ‘European core’ at the beginning of their modern industrialization (Pollard 1981: 45–83).18 It is one of the striking features of the eastern ‘European periphery’ that structural transformation as a conditio sine qua non for the transition to broad-based modern growth advanced only very slowly even after industrialization had started in the late 19th century. By contrast, in the European core productivity-enhancing structural transformation towards an industrial economy had started long before the emergence of modern Industry. Thus, among the early industrializing economies of North-Western and, up to a point, Central Europe, the weight of manufacturing and export-orientated ‘proto-industries’ in total output at the onset of their modern industrialization was far larger than in the Eastern and South-Eastern European ‘newcomers’. These had to build up modern, factory-based industry almost from scratch for a range of structural and institutional reasons. ‘It is the absence of structural change rather than the absence of growth that primarily calls for explanation and interpretation,’ Gerschenkron (1962: 213) observed in his seminal study of Bulgaria’s failed industrialization around the period 18901940. This assessment can serve as a starting point for a discussion of the broader region’s economic development before the First World War. Building upon Lenin’s analysis of capitalist development in Russia, Gerschenkron established a still highly influential explanation of retarded structural change and industrialization in the Tsarist Empire and South-East Europe (Gerschenkron 1962, 1965; Lenin 1899; Gatrell 1986: 70–83). Here, the argument goes, an inherently backward and unproductive peasant agriculture and its community-based institutions were preserved either by misguided, half-hearted agrarian reforms as in Russia or peasant-friendly agricultural policies as in Bulgaria.19 Agricultural development was blocked for decades with far-reaching negative consequences for industrialization and economic growth.20 In Gerschenkron’s view, the alternatives would have been to follow the ‘Prussian way’ by imposing a radical reform


Economic growth and sectoral developments 53
from above and so change the institutional framework of capitalist agriculture in a backward society or to imitate the British development based on unrestricted land and labour markets as well as mass eviction of allegedly less productive peasants (Gerschenkron 1965). The preservation of a tradition-bound small peasantry, it is argued, stifled agricultural productivity and income growth, restricted demand for manufactures and hindered the creation of a larger home market for industry. It delayed the release of labour out of agriculture to build up an ‘industrial reserve army’ and ultimately slowed down capital accumulation in modern industry. The original sin in the Gerschenkron view was the economic survival of a pre-modern, pre-capitalist peasantry which retarded industrialization and structural change in most of Eastern and South-Eastern Europe before the First World War. This view, though controversial, is still highly influential today. Some authors support Gerschenkron’s negative view of both small peasant and communal farming (Palairet 1997: 111–120, 298–341, 357–370; Sundhaussen 1989a: 219, 1989b). However, recent empirical research has challenged the traditional picture of Eastern Europe’ small peasantry as an almost insurmountable obstacle to growth, market orientation and agricultural development. The impact of communal farming on growth in large parts of the region remains an issue of lively debate (Castañeda and Markevich 2016; Markevich and Zhuravskaya 2018; Allen 2003: 21–46; Gregory 1994; Gatrell 1986: 99–140; Kopsidis and Ivanov 2017b; Kopsidis 2014; Kopsidis et al. 2015). However, the Habsburg case cautions against a general argument for strong positive (or negative) growth effects of 19th-century legal and institutional reforms (or the failure to introduce them). Whatever the merits of Gerschenkron’s view with respects to Russia and South-East Europe, it does not hold for the 19th-century Habsburg Empire. While earlier historical scholarship emphasized the significance of the reforms implemented in the aftermath of the 1848 revolutions for agricultural growth and development, in particular (e.g. Dinklage 1973; Hanák 1975; Katus 1970), Komlos’ (1983: 25–51, 214–220), quantitative research shows that the rate of economic growth was largely independent of state policy in two core areas. First, the formation of the Habsburg customs union (1850) had little effect on the expansion of either Austrian industry or Hungarian agriculture since the barriers to intra-empire trade were already fairly low by the time internal free trade and a common external tariff were introduced. Second, the full emancipation of the peasantry of 1848/1849 did not mark a turning point. The reforms separated lords from peasants without overcharging the peasantry and aided land and labour markets conducive to large estate agriculture based on wage labour (Hidas 1980; Niederhauser 1998; Kopsidis 2008). Yet Hungarian liberals were disappointed that their exemplary policies had no immediate impact on agricultural development and blamed peasant ‘stupidity’ (Voros 1980: 24–30). However, they missed an important point: in the late 18th century, the feudal obligations of the peasantry had been lowered already to such an extent that they were no longer a serious impediment to growth and development in the half century thereafter (Komlos 1983: 215).


54 Michael Kopsidis and Max-Stephan Schulze
Hence the impact of discrete reform packages on long-term growth should not be exaggerated, especially compared to factors such as increasingly integrated domestic and international food markets. Further doubts about the Gerschenkron approach arise when looking at agricultural growth, which was either significantly stronger than population growth (Austria, Hungary, Greece and Romania) or more or less on par with rapid demographic expansion as in Bulgaria and Russia (Tables 3.2 and 3.5). Imperial Hungary and the Tsarist Empire, the region’s third-largest and largest economies respectively, were also by far the two biggest agricultural producers in absolute terms whose farming sectors expanded rapidly, as did Romania’s (Tables 3.1 and 3.5). Overall, the region’s agricultural output grew significantly faster than in North-West Europe (Federico 2015: Table 3.7, 132).21 Weak agricultural growth per se, then, seems an unlikely cause of slow industrialization and retarded structural change in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe. On average, farming delivered the bulk of aggregate growth across the region (Table 3.5). Even if relatively early industrializing Austria and her comparatively sluggish agriculture are included, almost 40 per cent of the entire region’s growth in total GDP over 1870–1913 accrued out of agriculture, a third out of secondary and a quarter out of tertiary production (calculation based on data from Tables 3.1 and 3.5).22 Given the small initial size of industry, and especially manufacturing, for most of the region’s economies, it was the expansion of their agricultural sectors that was crucial for raising total and per capita output levels. Russia, Romania and Bulgaria can be best described as wheat or grain economies benefitting from the international agricultural commodity boom.23 The small Southeast European economies gained primarily from turning into agrarian export economies whilst pursuing industrialization strategies based at least partially on import substitution (Kopsidis 2012a: 21–22). Russia’s agriculture benefitted also from a large and expanding domestic food market in the industrializing parts of her vast empire. The position of Imperial Hungary was different. Over the course of the late 19th century, she withdrew from international grain markets to concentrate on the readily accessible Austrian market that was largely uncontested by foreign competition because of the Habsburg customs union’s common external tariff (Komlos 1983: 218–219). While total agricultural output in the region expanded rapidly during the 19th century, doubts remain as to whether and to what extent farming shifted to productivity-based modern growth. In the case of Hungary with its comparatively highly developed farming sector, the evidence for 1870–1913 shows that growth in total agricultural output was associated with rapid increases in output per worker and output per unit of land. Gaining from a large and highly integrated domestic market, most of this growth in labour productivity – above the rate for the aggregate economy was an outcome of significant capital investment in agriculture (financed in part by large capital inflows from Austria) and associated increases in the capital/labour ratio. It was much less a result of growth in total factor productivity, that is improvements in technology and organization, or advances in human capital, though these were not negligible (Schulze 2007a, Table 3.8).24


Economic growth and sectoral developments 55
However, the Hungarian productivity growth record is not characteristic for the region. Consistent and reliable sectoral labour productivity and total factor productivity (TFP) estimates are not available for the other pre-1914 economies of Eastern and South-Eastern Europe in the sample.25 Yet on balance, the evidence on agricultural employment shares (Table 3.7) and on growth in per capita agricultural output (Tables 3.2 and 3.5) points to only very modest increases in labour productivity in the long term. At the same time, the sources provide no reason to assume that TFP growth elsewhere in the region was on a par with or faster than in Hungary. In summary, extensive growth based on increases in factor inputs likely dominated in most parts of Europe’s east and south-east. What probably mattered most for economic change in Europe’s eastern half was the positive demographic response to the agricultural export boom. Under the conditions of poorly developed agrarian economies and ‘non-European’ demographic regimes characterized by high nuptiality and fertility (Hajnal 1965), any efforts aimed at raising living standards substantially were frustrated in much of Eastern and South-Eastern Europe at the end of the 19th century (Allen 2003: 13; Gatrell 1986: 56; Botev 1990). This was, evidently, not the case in the Habsburg Empire and Romania. However, in the worst case literally all gains in farm output could have been eaten up by an equally increasing population.26 ‘Immiserizing growth’ may have happened in Bulgaria (Ivanov and Tooze 2007; Palairet 1997: 298–341), though the GDP per capita estimates used here indicate stable or slightly increasing rather than falling average incomes (Table 3.4).27 This would suggest that at least some productivity-enhancing factors were effective in most parts of the region, neutralizing for a certain period the negative impact of a rising labour force (population) on agricultural productivity. Modern development economics has shown that under the conditions of an agrarian, low-skill and low-productivity economy characterized by inferior technology, poor education and high levels of widespread illiteracy, a positive exogenous shock such as integration into rapidly expanding world markets for food and agricultural raw materials induces rural population growth to accelerate (Lipton 1989; Galor 2005: 280–283). Theoretically, the more land is abundant, the stronger and more durable is this positive demographic effect. Moreover, the demographic reaction to contracting international demand typically appears to be delayed with a lag of one generation. Rurally based population growth can thus be stronger for long periods of time in poor, purely agrarian economies than in industrializing countries. The demographic expansion of the rural poor is often connected with dynamic agricultural growth but without structural change by tying resources to the rural sector. Yet both historical and present-day experience suggests that demographic expansion without structural change works strongly against the transition to self-sustaining modern growth. Under these conditions, population growth has the potential to put real incomes under severe pressure in the long run. This theoretical scenario helps explain why structural change proceeded so sluggishly in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe and why there was no catching-up to the industrial economies of North-Western Europe before the First World War. However,


56 Michael Kopsidis and Max-Stephan Schulze
it cannot account for the rise in living standards for large parts of the rural population observable in most countries under consideration before the First World War (Table 3.3; Gregory 1979, 1994: 37–54; Eddie 1968; Lampe and Jackson 1982: 143; Franghiadis 2011: 120, 130). During the 19th century until around 1870, a strong international terms of trade effect in favour of farm commodities worked against industrialization in less developed agrarian economies. Rather, this effect directed resources – labour, capital and land – into the agrarian export sector. In the short run, growth accelerated and living standards improved in the agrarian periphery, but in the long run any structural change in the direction of industry was discouraged (Williamson 2006, 2011; Pamuk and Williamson 2011). The driving force of this development was the deep integration of the European eastern periphery into the international trading system during the ‘first globalization’. As a result of a ‘commercial and transport revolution’, value added in trade, transport and communication increased faster than GDP.28 In the course of the ‘European grain invasion’, the international terms of trade slowly deteriorated for grain exporters after around 1870 (O’Rourke 1997). However, the concurrent railway boom in Russia, the Habsburg Empire and Romania opened up formerly isolated, landlocked regions with a high agrarian potential for market-orientated grain farming. The rapid fall in overland transport costs per ton to a fraction of their pre-railway levels connected local producers to regional, national and international markets. Thus at the farm level, demand for grain increased significantly and farm gate prices rose. As long as transport costs declined sufficiently strongly, local farm gate prices in areas previously disconnected from the railway network (and thus wider markets) could rise even if the international market price for grain fell. Such increases in local prices facilitated by the ‘transport revolution’, in turn, made more intensive commercial grain farming profitable for the first time in much of the eastern periphery. This held even under the conditions of the ‘European grain invasion’ (Metzer 1974; Allen 2003: 24–30; Eddie 1977; Katus 1983; Kopsidis 2008: 291).29 Increasing regional specialization connected with the labour- and capital-intensive opening up of new land in the Tsarist Empire, Imperial Hungary and the plains of South-East Europe very likely had a significant positive impact on agricultural yields, counterbalancing the negative effects of rural population growth on farm productivity and rural incomes (Gregory 1994: 30; Schulze 2000, 2007a: 197; Eddie 1968). Note, though, that population growth in Hungary was far slower than in Russia and Romania, making the net gains likely higher in the former than the latter. Under the conditions of competitive but expanding export markets, these productivity gains should have contributed to maintaining a high proportion of the total labour force in agriculture until the First World War (Table 3.6). In Imperial Hungary – with her close connection to the higher income markets in Austria – and Russia, agricultural specialization benefitted as well from growing food demand of the rising urban-industrial population. So-called backward eastern peasant economies such as, for instance, Russia’s exploited the new commercial opportunities of expanding


Economic growth and sectoral developments 57
markets within institutional frameworks which often included communal farming. In fact, the existence of small peasants and communal peasant farming did not per se obstruct substantial increases in farm output and productivity as claimed by Gerschenkron (Kopsidis et al. 2015; Löwe 1987; Gregory 1994: 37–54; Gatrell 1986: 98–140; Kopsidis 2008, 2012b, 2014; Reinold 2017). Markevich and Zhuravskaya’s (2018) recent analysis concludes that ‘the abolition of serfdom had a substantial positive effect on agricultural productivity, industrial development, and peasants’ nutrition in nineteenth century Russia because the 1861 emancipation had transformed ‘serfs with no rights over their own labor or human capital into free small-scale farmers’ (1113). They also argue for strong negative effects of communal farming on farm productivity measured by grain yields (Markevich and Zhuravskaya 2018; cf. Castañeda and Markevich 2016). However, the alleged benefits of so-called private farming are distinctly less evident once the entire crop production complex is considered and not just grain production (Kopsidis et al. 2015: 440). Further research is necessary to ascertain whether the new post-reform communal farming systems actually formed a severe obstacle to growth and commercialization of farming. In Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, an increasingly market-orientated agriculture developed during the period 1830–1914. However, the transition of the agricultural sector to modern, that is productivity-driven, output growth as a key ingredient in substantial structural change required a growing capacity of industry to absorb the emerging agricultural labour surplus. For significant labour transfers out of the primary sector to materialize, secondary sector activity, especially manufacturing, needs to have reached a certain minimum extent before the onset of modern industrialization and expand rapidly during industrialization (Hayami and Ruttan 1985: 421; Kopsidis and Ivanov 2017b: 68). The main hindrance to structural change in the region was not sluggish agricultural growth acting like a brake on aggregate expansion, as once thought. Rather, across much of Eastern and South-Eastern Europe the industrial sector was simply too small to absorb a large proportion of the emerging rural labour surplus, despite the rapid expansion of manufacturing after 1880. To re-state an earlier observation: the contribution of modern industry (manufacturing) to aggregate economic growth up to 1913 was distinctly limited except in Imperial Austria (Kopsidis and Ivanov 2017a; Allen 2003: 21–46; Klein et al. 2017; Markevich and Nafziger 2017).30 Finally, answering the question why around mid-century manufacturing and, more broadly, the industrial sector in Europe east of Imperial Austria was so small contributes a lot to our understanding of the delay in structural change. Pollard differentiates between an ‘outer’ and an ‘inner Europe’, the latter situated in the North-West which was able to imitate and adapt Britain’s industrial revolution quickly ‘but then there came a line where the process stopped, sometimes for generations, . . . Beyond it, there were only scattered outposts [of industrialization; authors’ addition], too weak to affect much the surrounding country as the more densely spaced industrial regions in Britain and in ‘inner Europe’ had been able to do’ (Pollard 1981: 46).


58 Michael Kopsidis and Max-Stephan Schulze
According to the literature, South-East Europe was the part of the continent least qualified to industrialize – a statement with far-reaching consequences as argued by Berend and Ránki and other scholars. A certain minimum degree of development (and GDP per head) had to be reached already at the outset so as be able to fully exploit Gerschenkronian advantages of relative backwardness for industrialization (Berend and Ránki 1982: 71–72, 155–160; Pollard 1981: 245–246; Lains 2002; Teichova 1985: 253; Kopsidis 2012a). Given the historical heritage of extremely sparsely populated, embattled imperial border lands and more than a century of anarchy within the Ottoman Empire before 1830, none of the South-East European counties had been able to cross this threshold by the middle of the 19th century. Exceptionally low living standards and low saving rates hampered capital formation, agrarian progress and industrialization. Severe institutional deficits in public administration, the legal system, commerce and industry as well as education made South-East Europe the least developed region of Europe even compared to the Tsarist Empire. It was this lack of initial economic development that, in contrast to Hungary and her integration into a relatively large and rich Habsburg home market, encouraged South-East Europe’s and also Russia’s specific reaction to the terms of trade-shock of the first globalization in the shape of an agricultural export boom. Integration into the capitalist world economy fostered the expansion of the agricultural sector and thus hindered structural transformation towards an industrial society. In other words, the relative underdevelopment of South-East Europe and, up to a point, Russia was in fact cemented by the first globalization. Mainly focusing on SouthEast Europe, this view finds support in a diverse historiography whose theoretical foundations range from a liberal, non-dogmatic Marxism to certain strands of neoclassical economics (Berend and Ránki 1982: 107–141, esp. 124; Williamson 2006, 2011; Pamuk 1987; Pamuk and Williamson 2011). Reclaiming land on a large scale over a long period as a way of labour-based ‘non-monetary capital formation’ was a task which was perfectly in tune with the factor endowments and factor qualities of Balkan rural societies (Kopsidis 2012b).31 It required and encouraged a strong demographic reaction to increasing demand for farm labour, which, as has been shown, was forthcoming, and the establishment of rural trade and credit markets able to meet the comparatively low capital demand of small peasant producers. Balkan rural societies and merchants were fully capable of building up sophisticated socalled interlocked rural factor and product markets. However, it was an altogether different and, before the 1870s, largely unachieved task to mobilize resources and capabilities in terms of infrastructure, institutions, and physical and human capital formation on a scale sufficient for the development of a sizeable industrial sector. The limited size of their domestic markets was another major constraint on the Balkan economies, but far less so on Tsarist Russia.
Conclusion
East-Central, Eastern and South-Eastern Europe experienced profound economic changes during the 19th century. On the eve of the First World War, average


Economic growth and sectoral developments 59
incomes across the region were far higher than they had been a century earlier. However, despite rapid aggregate growth from the 1870s, this part of the continent remained significantly less developed and far more reliant on agriculture than Europe’s Northern and North-Western economies. In terms of per capita output, there was no catching-up of the East with the West. Rather, the region as a whole was falling further behind the more advanced Western economies. Notwithstanding significant differences in performance, even within the region the initially least developed economies failed to exploit the potential to catch up with Austria.32 The Habsburg economy displayed an early and significant developmental lead over Tsarist Russia and South-East Europe that was maintained throughout the 19th century. It was in the western domains of the Habsburg Empire, Alpine Austria and the Czech lands where industrialization first took roots and gathered pace in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. This process and its gradual, though uneven, spread across the imperial lands built inter alia on the far-reaching reforms implemented during the ‘enlightened absolutism’ of the later 18th century (Ingrao 2000). These reforms led to the development of institutional and legal arrangements conducive to the beginnings of self-sustained, productivity-based Kuznetsian Modern Economic Growth (Komlos 1989) – and far earlier so than anywhere else in the region. In this process, the empire and, especially Austria, could rely on a significantly larger human capital stock as an outcome of earlier and growing commitments to schooling than the other Eastern and South-Eastern European economies.33 The economic union between Austria and Hungary encouraged economic development in the poorer, mainly agrarian eastern half of the empire: here, in contrast to the other economies of the region, growth in agricultural output equalled the rate of GDP growth. Most significantly, output per worker in Hungarian agriculture increased faster than in all other economic branches except mining (1870–1910), and productivity growth in farming was a key factor in intraempire catching-up, augmenting the impact of the rise in modern industry.34 This was unique among the eastern European grain economies, where growth in total agricultural output was far less shaped by gains in labour productivity and far more by increases in labour and land used. In the agrarian eastern parts of Europe, the spread of modern manufacturing as one of the main drivers of unconditional convergence did not nearly have the same deep impact on aggregate and productivity growth than another channel of economic modernization: the rise of export orientated agriculture in the course of the first globalization. In a world where the demographic transition had not yet taken place and where capital was scarce, rapidly expanding international demand for grain led to a strong increase in demand for rural labour to facilitate both the intensification of farming (more units of labour per unit of land) and the expansion into new farm lands on a continental scale. As a result, rural population growth was pushed up. While yields per hectare likely increased significantly, it is far less certain that agricultural output per worker in the eastern grain economies grew at rates even remotely as fast as those observed for Hungary. The evidence on growth in primary output per head cautions against an overly optimistic view on this

score. What seems far more likely is that in an environment of rapid population growth, a large proportion of the work force remained tied to a large rural sector characterized by comparatively low labour productivity and at best modest productivity growth. The consequences for longer-term aggregate growth, productivity advance and structural change in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe were serious. In much of the region outside the Habsburg Empire, a key constraint on the expansion in aggregate per capita output was the small initial size of the industrial sector. This restricted the capacity to absorb rural demographic growth and slowed down structural change despite fairly rapid increases in manufacturing and mining output. Agriculture remained the dominant sector by a large margin. Yet the productivity advances associated with eastern farming’s rising market orientation were not nearly equivalent to the gains that modern manufacturing realized in the advanced western European economies before the First World War. Consequently, the region was falling further behind the leading industrial economies of the West. However, in this view it was less ‘eastern backwardness’ and more the integration into the world economy in the course of the first globalization and its demographic consequences which prevented convergence to western income levels.
Notes
1 See Table 3.3 on the eastern European economies’ GDP per capita in comparative perspective. For recent PPP-adjusted estimates of GDP in Europe, see Broadberry and Klein (2012), Maddison Database (2010), Maddison Project Database (2013) and Bolt et al. (2018). Note the differences in country-specific income levels reported in these sources which are due to either different underlying GDP series (in national currency) and/or the use of different PPP converters. Further, long-run time-series projections of PPP-adjusted output or income levels (e.g. of 1990 GDP per capita) into the past are by construction affected by index number problems. In short, any level comparisons should be treated with some caution. See Prados de la Escosura (2000) and Bolt et al. (2018) for a fuller discussion. 2 The sample composition here is conditioned by data availability. For example, annual reconstructions of GDP and its sectoral composition over the period of review are not available for either Serbia or the Ottoman Empire/Turkey. Lampe and Jackson (1982) offer an approximation of Serbian gross output (as distinct from gross value added or GDP) on the eve of the First World War. Palairet (1997) presents detailed estimates of Serbia’s GDP (by sector of origin), net domestic product (NDP) and net national product (NNP) but these, too, are limited to just one benchmark year (1910); however, he compares 1910 NNP with an earlier estimate for 1863 (Palairet 1995), suggesting a decline in real per capita income over the half century. For Turkey and the Ottoman Empire, Pamuk (2006) and Altug et al. (2008) have produced benchmark estimates of GDP per capita for 1820, 1870/1880 and 1913. Their data would suggest that Turkish GDP per capita increased by about 0.5 per cent per annum from 1820 to 1870 and 0.7 per cent per annum over the period 1870–1913. The limited evidence on levels and growth of per capita product and what we do know about the structure of the Serbian and Turkish economies – on the eve of the First World War, both were still heavily dominated by the agricultural sector – do not materially affect the findings and conclusions of this chapter. Rather, this material lends support to the main argument developed below. 3 We used three-year moving averages to smooth the deflator employed by Kostelenos and his co-authors to derive constant price GDP from nominal GDP. Their deflator


Economic growth and sectoral developments 61
reflects price changes for only a very small number of items and shows some extremely pronounced year-on-year fluctuations that likely exert unduly strong effects on the real GDP measure. 4 Mining has been re-allocated from the primary to the secondary sector to align with practice in other GDP reconstructions used here. 5 Details on the derivation of the new GDP series are available from the authors. 6 The comparative growth rates are 3.04 (Gregory 1982), 3.06 (new estimates) and 3.12 per cent per annum (Allen 2003). Note that Gregory’s national income series (NNP, variant 2) displays somewhat faster growth of 3.34 per cent per annum than any of the gross value-added series. 7 Cf. footnote 1. Except for Bulgaria, the Habsburg Empire and Russia, 1913 levels in GDP per capita have been taken from Broadberry and Klein (2012) and projected backwards using indices based on the sources listed in Tables 3.1 and 3.2. For Bulgaria, we draw on Ivanov (2012), for the Habsburg Empire on an adjusted version of Maddison’s (2010) implicit converter for Austria, and for Russia on Markevich and Nafziger (2017) to convert real GDP per capita in national currencies into 1990 international dollars. 8 Note, however, that according to Palairet’s (1997) calculations real per capita income (NNP) in Serbia declined by about 0.22 per cent per annum (or about 10 per cent overall) between 1863 and 1910. Further, his estimates would suggest that by 1910 Serbian GDP per capita (NNP per capita), measured in 1910 francs, was about 26–27 per cent below the levels of Bulgaria. If these comparative measures are about right, Serbia was by far the region’s worst performing economy in the late 19th century among those on which at least some domestic product estimates are available. On the eve of the First World War Serbia was also the poorest, with per capita income levels well below those not only of Bulgaria but also of Turkey ($1,200 in 1990 PPP-adjusted terms; Pamuk 2006). 9 GDP data for Bulgaria are available only for 1870, 1880 and then, annually, the period 1888 to 1913. 10 In its ‘unconditional’ or ‘absolute’ form, the convergence hypothesis implies that income per capita differentials between economies will disappear in the long-run. The ‘conditional’ convergence hypothesis, on the other hand, takes also account of (i.e. β-convergence is conditional on) economies’ different structural characteristics (and not just initial income differentials). Here the implication is that an economy’s income per capita (or per worker) converges to a long-run level that is specific to this economy and determined by its structural features. 11 Cf. Abramovitz (1986) on catch-up growth and threshold levels of social capabilities that an economy must have attained in order to be able to exploit its catch-up potential. 12 Primary sector: agriculture, fishing, forestry. Secondary sector: manufacturing, mining, handicrafts, construction. Tertiary sector: trade, transport, communications, public and private services, housing. 13 By 1840, output in the secondary sector accounted for more than 17 per cent of GDP in Austria – a share that Russia achieved only about half a century or so later; cf. Table 3.6. See Table 3.7 for sectoral shares in the labour force after 1870 which confirm Austria’s comparative industrial ‘lead’ over the period under review. 14 Note that the sectoral composition of Greek real GDP is a very rough approximation based on sector shares in nominal GDP. Intertemporal changes in relative prices between sectors make for differences in the composition of current price and constant price output. The results should, therefore, be interpreted cautiously and seen as at best indicative. 15 In 1913, the sector’s share in GDP in Russia, the closest of the eastern economies on this measure, was less than 27 per cent compared to more than 37 per cent in Austria (Table 3.6). 16 In 1913, manufacturing accounted for 67 per cent of secondary sector output (25 per cent of GDP) in Austria, 64 per cent (14 per cent) in Hungary, 47 per cent (11 per cent) in Romania and – including mining – 56 per cent (15 per cent) in Russia; cf. Table 3.1

for sources. For a more detailed discussion of manufacturing growth and its regional dimensions in the Habsburg Empire, see Klein et al. (2017: 66–74). 17 The contrast in development is particularly stark when considering the economically most advanced parts of Imperial Austria, Alpine Austria and the Czech lands, where agriculture’s share in real GDP was already down to 23 (22) per cent by 1870 with the secondary sector accounting for 31 (39) per cent. By 1913, the share of agriculture had fallen to 16 (19) per cent, while that of mining, manufacturing, crafts and construction had risen to 38 (45) per cent (unpublished revised regional GDP estimates for the Habsburg Empire based on methods and sources set out in Schulze (2007b)). 18 To give an example: Germany was one of the least urbanized and most agrarian economies among the earlier continental European industrializers. In 1849, at around the beginning of her industrial takeoff, less than 58 per cent of the total labour force worked in primary production, already 27 per cent in secondary and 15 per cent in tertiary production (own calculation, data from Frank 1994). 19 With the exception of Romania, which was ruled by great land owners, the internal political stabilization as well as the military power of the emerging new states in SouthEast Europe was based on the alliance between the (urban) elites and small peasants, whose claims to the land were widely met at the expense of large estate agriculture (Calic 1994: 43–52; Franghiadis 2011; Lampe and Jackson 1982: 200; Palairet 1997: 174–186; Sundhaussen 1989a: 197–200). 20 According to Gerschenkron, the Russian emancipation reforms of the 1860s that were to end serfdom were implemented in such way that they ‘reinforced the communal organization of rural society and installed collective redemption payments in return for communal land rights. These features undermined agricultural incentives, reduced labour mobility and kept rural demand low’ (Markevich and Nafziger 2017: 28). 21 Federico’s (2015) estimates of world agricultural production 1870–1913 show that within Europe, value added in agriculture grew the fastest in Eastern Europe at 2.1 per cent per annum (North-Western Europe: 0.9 per cent, Southern Europe: 1.0 per cent). Only South America displayed a higher rate of growth at 4.9 per cent (world: 1.5 per cent). 22 Allen’s comment on the Russian grain economy probably applies just as well to Romania, Bulgaria and Hungary: ‘Since grain was the main cargo of the railroads and since the wholesaling of grain was a major activity of the trade sector, agriculture, probably accounted for over half of the growth in the Russian economy’ (Allen 2003: 26). 23 By 1913, Russia and Romania, respectively, had become the largest and fourth-largest grain (mainly wheat) exporter in the world. Bulgaria ranked sixth. For 1909/1914 the grain export ranking is (1) Russia (=100); (2) Canada (= 49); (3) United States (=39); (4) Romania (= 31); (5) India (= 29); (6) Bulgaria (= 5) (Lampe and Jackson 1982: 170; Roberts 1951: 56–60, Schmalz 1921: 27). In 1901–1914, Romania exported 44 per cent of her grain harvest (wheat, rye, barley, oats and maize), Russia 14 per cent, and Bulgaria almost 18 per cent (own calculation based on data from Mitchell (2003: C2, 261–319, C10, 402–410; and Schmalz 1921: 27)). In Romania and Bulgaria, cereals accounted for 80 per cent and 64 per cent of all exports in 1906–1910 (Lampe and Jackson 1982: 169). Interestingly, in Russia the share of raw materials (including agricultural commodities) in total exports actually increased from 49 (1762) to 93 per cent (1856–1860) to reach 96 per cent (1909–1913) during rapid industrialization. Over the same period, the share of manufactured goods in exports fell from 50 per cent to less than 5 per cent (Mironov 2000: 36). To a large extent, Russia paid with wheat for the capital and capital goods imports during her ‘first industrial spurt’. 24 Sector-specific estimates of TFP growth in Austria and Hungary are not available, but at the aggregate economy level TFP expanded at 0.37 and 0.30 per cent per annum, respectively (0.46 and 0.62 per cent if livestock is included in the capital stock), Note that in Austria, agricultural (and by extension aggregate) labour productivity growth was held back by a rural sector displaying far lower rates of capital formation than in Hungary.


Economic growth and sectoral developments 63
25 Note, though, Altug et al.’s (2008) discussion of the sources of long-term growth in Turkey. Their results for 1880–1913 point to low overall TFP growth and a small TFP contribution to aggregate growth. 26 Hajnal (1965) identified a western European pattern of late and non-universal marriage which strictly restricted fertility west of the so-called Hajnal line going from St. Petersburg to Trieste. East of this line, even in Europe, universal marriage and much higher fertility prevailed, as in most parts of the world. The economic consequences of these different demographic patterns were far-reaching because a ‘non-European marriage pattern’ reacting positively to economic growth reinforced population growth and thus worked against convergence of per capita incomes across Europe until the First World War. 27 For Bulgaria, Palairet’s ‘immiserizing growth’ thesis rests on a very small and heterogeneous data base for the late Turkish period. Even for the 1880s the data situation is critical. However, Ivanov’s GDP data for 1887–1911 point to very slowly increasing incomes at best. 28 Within tertiary production, the transport, communications, trade and finance sector (TCTF) increased the strongest. In Imperial Austria, Imperial Hungary and the Tsarist Empire, TCTF grew annually at 3.25 per cent (1870–1913), 3.98 per cent (1870–1913) and 3.52 per cent (1885–1913), respectively (own data and calculation; see Table 3.1 for sources). 29 However, in contrast, the mountainous parts of South-East Europe before 1914 only reluctantly experienced a revolution of transport costs – certainly a major obstacle to agricultural development since large inlands of South-East Europe found themselves isolated, excluded from supra-local market relationships (Ehrlich 1985; Palairet 1997: 113–120; Papakonstantinou 2011; Petmezas 2011: 471–472; Kopsidis 2012b, 2014). These disfavoured regions ‘exported’ their labour force to booming regions within or outside South-Eastern and Eastern Europe. 30 Cf. note 16. 31 Balkan rural societies reacted to the terms of trade-shock of the first globalization in the same way, although they had different prevailing Agrarverfassungen (agrarian institutions). Allegedly subsistence-orientated Bulgarian or Greek small but free peasant farmers as well as reputedly ‘semi-feudalist’ but nonetheless ‘more capitalist’ Romanian land magnates had swiftly enhanced production for export since the 1830s. 32 Romania was the only Eastern economy outside the Habsburg customs union where the percentage per capita income gap to Austria decreased before the First World War. In absolute terms, though, this gap widened further during the late 19th century (Table 3.3). 33 See Fernandes and Schulze (2009) for a comparative discussion of human capital formation based on average years of schooling in Austria, Hungary and Germany; the online data appendices to Lindert (2004) provide broadly comparable information on school enrolment rates across the region (http://economics.ucdavis.edu/people/fzlinder/ peter-linderts-webpage/data-and-estimates/lindert-data-for-cup-book). 34 On the causes of these output and productivity gains, see Eddie (1968), Good (1984), Komlos (1983), Schulze (2000, 2007a).
