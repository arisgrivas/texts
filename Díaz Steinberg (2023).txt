Abstract
The objective of this thesis is to explore how Uruguay adhered to the gold standard for 38 years
almost without interruption. This requires examining two related aspects. The first regards how
the gold standard actually operated in Uruguay. What were the specific factors that allowed the
banks to maintain the convertibility of notes? What tools were available to deal with economic
volatility? The second aspect relates to the consequences of gold standard adherence. In other
words, what were the benefits and the costs of a fixed exchange rate for the Uruguayan
economy? Chapter 2 examines the issue of the rules of the game under a multiple currency
issuing bank system, focusing on the actions of specific banks. Chapter 3 takes a macro level
approach, looking at one of the main sources of external volatility, capital flows, and analyzes
how the balance of payments and the money supply adjusted to changes in this variable.
Chapter 4 looks more closely at one episode of capital inflows, the leadup to the 1890 crisis
(also known as the Baring Crisis), comparing Uruguay to its neighbor, Argentina, which
experienced a similar boom and crisis.
The results of this thesis show that, in general terms, gold standard adherence placed important
limits on a peripheral country like Uruguay. Over the long run, the rules of the game had to be
respected, meaning the money supply had to stay in line with gold reserves. However, some
bank may have tried to cushion the effects of external volatility by managing their balance
sheets countercyclically, with economy-wide effects. In addition, the fixed exchange rate may
have offered certain advantages beyond those commonly highlighted by the literature (ease of
trade and access to capital markets on better terms). The gold standard allowed the government
to avoid the erosion of fiscal revenues caused by currency depreciation. Strict convertibility
forced banks to manage reserves prudently; this in turn may have attracted gold to Uruguay its
neighbor, Argentina, that was on inconvertible paper currency.
Key words: Uruguay, gold standard, banks, fixed exchange rates, balance of payments

Resumen
El objetivo de esta tesis es explorar cómo Uruguay pudo adherirse al patrón oro por 38 años
casi sin interrupción. Esto requiere examinar dos aspectos relacionados. El primero refiere a
cómo el patrón oro efectivamente operó en Uruguay. ¿Cuáles fueron los factores específicos
que permitieron a los bancos mantener la convertibilidad de sus billetes? ¿Qué herramientas
estaban disponibles para enfrentar la volatilidad económica? El segundo aspecto se relaciona
con los beneficios y los costos del tipo de cambio fijo para la economía uruguaya. El capítulo
2 examina el tema de las reglas del juego en un sistema de banca libre, poniendo el foco en la
acción de bancos específicos. El capítulo 3 aborda el nivel macro, mirando una de las
principales fuentes de volatilidad externa, los flujos de capital, y analiza cómo la balanza de
pagos y los agregados monetarios reaccionaban a cambios en esta variable. El capítulo 4 mira
más de cerca un episodio de entrada de capitales, los años anteriores a la crisis de 1890 (también
conocida como la Crisis de Baring), y compara con su vecino, Argentina, quien experimentó
un boom y crisis similar al de Uruguay.
Los resultados de esta tesis muestran que, en términos generales, el patrón oro implicaba limites
importantes para un país periférico como Uruguay. En el largo plazo, las reglas del juego tenían
que ser respetadas, implicando que la oferta monetaria tenía que mantenerse en línea con las
reservas de oro. Sin embargo, es posible que algunos bancos intentaron amortiguar los efectos
de la volatilidad externa, manejando sus balances de forma contra cíclica, con impactos para
la economía en su conjunto. Además, el tipo de cambio fijo puede haber brindado a Uruguay
ciertas ventajas más allá de las que son comúnmente señaladas en la literatura (más facilidad
en el comercio internacional y mejor acceso a mercados de capitales). El patrón oro permitió
que el gobierno evite la erosión de ingresos fiscales que sería causada por la depreciación
cambiaria. La convertibilidad estricta obligó a los bancos a manejar sus reservas de forma
prudente; esto posiblemente hizo que llegara oro a Uruguay del país vecino, Argentina, que
operaba una moneda papel inconvertible.

Chapter 1: Introduction
1.1 Uruguay: a case study for the gold standard in peripheral countries
The choice of exchange rate regime has been of central interest for economists and
policymakers since at least the 19th century. The current consensus appears to have materialized
around floating exchange rates as the optimal choice, albeit with some major exceptions. The
euro area has opted for the most fixed of internal exchange rates -a single currency-, while
many developing countries exhibit a “fear of floating”, as demonstrated by the wide variety of
“crawling pegs” and “dirty floats” applied by central banks (Calvo and Reinhart, 2002; Bordo
and Flandreau, 2003).
The consensus around floating exchange rates is a relatively new phenomenon. During the
classical gold standard era, which got underway in the last third of the 19th century, many
countries chose to link their domestic currencies to gold at a fixed exchange. All the major
European powers adhered to the system from at least the 1870s, while many countries in the
European periphery joined that decade or soon after. Other countries further afield often
attempted to fix their currency to gold, usually with only short-lived success (Eichengreen,
2008). Countries adopted the gold standard in order to promote internal stability and foster
external integration.1 Since the collapse of the system during the First World War, the interwar
gold exchange standard, Bretton Woods and the European Monetary Union were all, in a sense,
attempts by developed countries to recuperate the benefits that a fixed exchange rate system
can provide (Bordo, 1999: 1-2, 14-18).
This can in part be explained by the fact that the classical gold worked quite well in many
respects, at least for the countries at the core of the system (Bordo and Schwartz, 1999: 238
39; Eichengreen, 2008: 29-31). It was to a certain degree a self-adjusting system, but the
reputation of each country’s monetary authorities and cooperation between the major powers
1 The gold standard provided long run price stability (Bordo, 1999), and there is evidence that being on gold fostered trade with other gold standard countries (Lopez-Córdova and Meissner, 2003) and allowed access to foreign capital on better terms (Bordo and Rockoff, 1996; Meissner, 2004).

also played a role. The investment flows that emanated from the core created demand for the
capital goods and manufactures they exported, relieving pressure on the balance of payments.
However, core countries, as well as most countries in the European periphery, also tended to
have large, long-established institutions -central banks- that helped manage monetary affairs.
Their unquestioned commitment to the gold standard meant that when exchanges fell, short
term capital flowed in, anticipating that the monetary authorities would do whatever it took to
protect the fixed exchange rate. Over time central banks learned to work within the gold points
and leverage their credibility to achieve some breathing room within which they could act as
lender of last resort -providing liquidity to struggling banks in order to prevent a wider panic-,
a responsibility that was slowly assumed over the course of the late 19th century. In addition,
cooperation between core country central banks smoothed frictions and stemmed crises before
they could spread (Eichengreen, 2008: 32-37).
Peripheral countries had a more difficult time adhering to the gold standard, in part because
equilibrating forces in the balance of payments were absent. There was no accommodating
factor to adjust to a fall in export values or a reduction in capital inflows, events which often
coincided. Being primary goods producers, these countries were price takers for their exports
and for a broad range of imports, meaning there was little scope for internal price changes.
Adjustments had to occur through painful changes in income and employment, with
consequent pressures for changes in policy (Triffin, 1947; Ford, 1962; Eichengreen, 2008: 37
41). Moreover, outside of Europe, most countries did not have central banks that could smooth
volatility even within the narrow limits provided by their international insertion.
Despite this, many peripheral countries tried to fix their currencies to gold in the hopes that
this would provide financial stability, facilitate trade and lower capital costs (Bordo and
Rockoff, 1996; Meissner, 2004; Mitchener, Shizume and Weidenmeir 2010). However, most
countries outside Europe that attempted to join the gold standard in the 19th century could only
remain in the systema few years. To name just a few Latin American examples, Argentina was
on gold beginning in 1867, but was forced to exit in 1876 after a major crisis. It joined again
in 1883, but was forced off in 1885, and did not return to the gold standard until 1899. Brazil
had a failed attempt from 1888 to 1889, joining again only in 1906. Chile fixed its currency to
gold in 1895, but devaluated in 1898 and never went back (Bordo and Rockoff, 1999: 332). It
wasn’t until the 20th century that a flood of peripheral countries outside Europe joined the club
with success, only to exit when the system collapsed during WWI (Reinhart and Rogoff, 2010).


3
There is one exception to this rule for peripheral countries: Uruguay was on the gold standard
for 38 years, joining in 1876 and remaining on gold almost uninterruptedly until 1914. This is
longer than any country outside of Europe and a few of her colonies, and as long or longer than
some of the core countries of Europe. For example, of the European countries that were still
on gold in 1914, Denmark joined in the same year as Uruguay, Finland in 1877, and France,
Belgium and Switzerland in 1878 (Reinhart and Rogoff, 2010).
It is difficult to highlight sufficiently the singularity of the Uruguayan case. This small republic
began to engage with the Atlantic economy in the 1860s, exporting livestock products, mostly
hides, wool and salted beef. It was highly dependent on foreign investment to finance the
expansion of the state and for the construction of railways and urban infrastructures (Bertino
and Millot, 1996). Uruguay’s narrow export basket, commercially open economy and
dependence on capital inflows would have left it highly exposed to the vicissitudes of
international markets. Yet, outside of Europe and a handful of her colonies, no country adhered
to the gold standard longer than Uruguay did.
Uruguay is unique not only in the length of time it maintained a fixed exchange rate, but also
in how it achieved this feat. The country lacked anything like a central bank throughout most
of the period.2 Until 1907, it had multiple privately-owned currency issuing banks.
Furthermore, these banks operated with a minimal regulatory framework. They needed a
government charter to operate, but the only limits placed on their balance sheets was that note
issues were capped at three times the bank’s paid-up capital and the requirement that notes be
converted to gold on demand at the stipulated exchange rate. There were no other prudential
regulations or legal safeguards of any kind (Acevedo, 1903: 307-308). This makes Uruguay an
unlikely gold standard success story, and therefore an interesting case through which to study
how the system worked in peripheral countries.
The uniqueness of the Uruguayan case begs for two questions to be answered. The first is, why
did the country remain on the gold standard for 38 years? The second is how did achieve this
feat, where so many other countries failed? The ultimate answer to the first question is a
political economy one: the gold standard endured because people in power wanted it to. These
were the merchant community, many of them foreigners residing in Uruguay (mostly British,
2 In 1907, the Banco de la República Oriental del Uruguay (BROU), a quasi-state bank, became the sole paper currency issuer. However, at that time, most modern-day central banking functions were either not within its control or not yet developed in Uruguay (for a description of central banking functions see Goodhart, 1988, and Ugolini, 2017; for a discussion of the evolution of central banking in Uruguay see Diaz and Moreira, 2016).


4
but also French and German), that dominated the import trade (Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 448
452). The Uruguayan state was relatively weak during the 19th century and, perhaps because
of this, enjoyed relative autonomy from rural landed interests (Peloso and Tenenbaum, 1996).
This meant that merchants were a comparatively powerful force in Uruguay, compared to, say,
Argentina, where rural landowners dominated the government (Barrán and Nahum, 1987;
Rapoport, 2000: 14-16). The merchant elite controlled the main banks, and through them
imposed monetary orthodoxy on the republic.
This thesis does not address these political economy issues. Instead, it focuses on the ‘how’,
rather than the ‘why’, Uruguay stayed on the gold standard for 38 years. As will be discussed
in more depth in the next section, gold standard adherence presented major challenges for a
country like Uruguay. As an exporter of a small number of primary products and an importer
of capital, the Uruguayan economy was exposed to a large degree of volatility from the external
sector, leading to major current account reversals, and consequent negative effects on growth.
The temptation to try to escape the iron grip of the balance of payments on the money supply
was strong. The lack of a central bank made reserve management of the type practiced in
Europe difficult. The rules of the game were broken in both directions. Sometimes, banks
allowed note circulation and deposits to grow much more rapidly than gold reserves, inevitably
putting the exchange rate at risk. However, in the short run, some banks appear to have
sterilized gold flows, in a similar fashion to what central banks did in Europe, and may have
had relative success in shielding the economy from external volatility.
The thesis focuses on Uruguay in order to shed light on how the classical gold standard worked
outside of Europe. The main objective is to explore how Uruguay adhered to the gold standard.
This requires examining two related aspects. The first regards how the gold standard actually
operated in Uruguay. Ogren (2012) highlights that the gold standard was not a system imposed
from above. On the contrary, it was a bottom-up system, where each country found ways to
navigate the challenges it presented. What were the specific factors that allowed the banks to
maintain the convertibility of notes? What tools were available to deal with economic
volatility? The second aspect relates to the consequences of gold standard adherence. In other
words, what were the benefits and the costs of a fixed exchange rate for the Uruguayan
economy? How did moments of financial fragility, that led so many other countries to abandon
the system, play out in Uruguay?


5
1.2 Theoretical considerations
1.2.1 General themes in the gold standard literature
Being on the gold standard implied two things: using only gold (or gold backed foreign
exchange) as the monetary base and maintaining the convertibility of domestic paper currency.
The first was attained by making gold the only legal tender and demonetizing other metals. The
second was achieved by the monetary authority standing ready to convert domestic currency
to gold at a specified rate and allowing the metal to be freely exported and imported (Bordo,
1999: 6, 28).
One part of the gold standard literature has been concerned with explaining the move from
other metallic standards to gold. Most European countries were on a bimetallic or silver
standard during the greater part of the 19th century. However, the changing relative supply or
demand of silver and gold meant that the market exchange rate between the two metals could
deviate from the official mint prices, creating violent swings in the monetary base when the
undervalued metal was drained from circulation. Many countries joined the gold standard in
the 1870s and 1880s when they abandoned silver or bimetallism and recognized only gold
coins as legal tender.3 The move from silver and bimetallism to gold is often explained by
“network effects”, since trade and finance between countries were facilitated by adoption of
the same monetary standard (Meissner, 2004). Britain’s rise as the world’s foremost
international lender and Germany’s adoption of gold in 1871 created incentives for their closest
trading partners to do so as well. In this way, gold became the international currency with
which trade and finance was conducted, essentially eliminating external exchange rate risk
(Eichengreen, 2008: 16-17).
Banknotes and deposits allowed countries to economize on scarce gold reserves, lubricating
internal trade and finance. However, the expansion of banking, paper currency and deposits
created internal exchange rate risk. If the fixed exchange rate was to be defended, sufficient
reserves had to be maintained to meet demand for converting domestic currency to gold,
making changes in the country’s money supply heavily conditioned by changes in reserves
held by the monetary authority. Since most countries did not have mineral gold deposits,
reserves were intimately tied to the balance of payments, and consequently so were money and
prices. The risk of suspending convertibility and resorting to currency depreciation was present
3 The first country to go on the gold standard was Britain, which demonetized silver in 1821. Portugal, with close commercial ties to Britain, moved from bimetallism to gold in 1854.


6
throughout the gold standard period. The fact that the major economic powers, as well as part
of the European periphery, maintained fixed exchange rates for several decades before 1914 is
in some ways surprising, and economic historians have dedicated great effort to explaining
how this was achieved.
Because of the central role of the balance of payments, a good deal of the gold standard
literature has focused on the way economies adjusted to disturbances in the external sector.
The earliest model of how adjustment worked, the price-specie-flow mechanism popularized
by Hume (1777), postulated that balance of payment disturbances resulted in international gold
flows, and these brought restored equilibrium through their effect on prices and consumption
patterns.4 However, Hume’s model predicts large gold flows and divergent price movements
between countries, when in fact the opposite is observed. Gold flows were small relative to
current account imbalances, and price movements tended to remain in line between gold
standard countries, both in the short and long-term (McCloskey and Zecher, 1981). Since
Hume’s description was published, the model has been extended to explain these facts and to
capture other important aspects of the gold standard world, including the role of capital flows,
the function of interest rates and the actions of central banks.5
Short-term capital flows played an important role in the balance of payments adjustment
mechanism. A gold outflow would cause the money supply to contract and interest rates to rise.
Higher rates would prompt capital to flow in, stemming the gold outflow. A gold inflow would
have the opposite effect, causing interest rates to fall and short-term capital to flow out. This
meant that part of the burden of adjustment was taken up by capital flows, and explains in part
the relative lack of international gold movements. As capital markets grew more integrated
over the last third of the 19th century, short-term capital flows came to be regarded as the
primary adjustment mechanism under the gold standard (Bordo, 1999: 32).
4 For example, a balance of payments deficit would lead to a gold outflow, decreasing the money supply and thereby lowering the domestic price level. Falling prices would then move the balance of payments back into equilibrium as domestic goods became cheaper vis-a-vis imports and consumption shifted away from imported goods towards local production. In the case of a gold inflow, the opposite would occur; the money supply would expand, pushing up domestic prices, shifting spending to imported goods and returning the balance of payments to equilibrium (Eichengreen, 2008: 24-25). 5 These have tended to be related to different trends in economics that have arisen over the last century. That is, the classical gold standard era has been used as a testing ground for different macroeconomic theories. Many of these applications are summarized in detail in chapters 2 and 3 of Bordo (1999: 27-124), and more succinctly in Eichengreen (1992).


7
A second important factor in equilibrating the balance of payments was the role of long-term
capital flows. The spread of the gold standard in the last decades of the 19th century coincided
with a massive rise in international capital flows from the most advanced countries of Europe
towards the periphery.6 Britain, the largest capital exporter, invested on average about 5% of
its GDP overseas in the four decades before 1914, while France and Germany invested about
half as much (Fishlow, 1985: 384). The greater part of these flows was directed towards
financing government spending and investment in private enterprises, often involving
construction of large infrastructures like railways, ports, waterworks, sewage systems and
electricity generation and distribution networks. They allowed for substantial trade surpluses
in core countries and financed large current account deficits in peripheral regions (Fishlow,
1985; Davis and Huttenback, 1986). Due to the uses to which capital exports were put, they
created a large demand for goods exports. Capital goods, like locomotives, steel rails, and
copper wire were necessary for the construction of transport and communications
infrastructure. Mining equipment, wire fencing cattle ranching, plows for agriculture and
machinery for basic industry were also key for developing the resources made accessible by
transport infrastructures. Exports of manufactures, such as textiles, also rose as population and
incomes grew in the importing countries. Much of these goods were produced exclusively in
the capital exporting countries, meaning their goods exports rose along with overseas
investment. Furthermore, this investment created a stream of interest and dividend flows from
peripheral towards core countries. Merchandise exports and debt service played a
compensating role in the balance of payments, allowing capital exports to be offset by current
account surpluses (Ford, 1962; Bordo, 1999).
Another significant phenomenon was the role that central banks played in adjusting to
economic disturbances. These institutions managed the country’s international reserves and
were tasked with maintaining the fixed exchange rate. When facing a gold drain, they could
raise interest rates preemptively, which would have a two-pronged effect. First, higher rates
would be deflationary, through curtailed lending and dampened demand. Second, they would
draw in short-term capital from abroad. Both mechanisms would stem the gold outflow. Where
the commitment of the monetary authorities to the fixed exchange rate was unquestioned, it
was often not necessary to raise interest rates. A rise in the exchange rate would be met with
6 This does not mean that most British, French and German capital went to poor countries. Clemens and Williamson (2004) show that capital flowed in greater volume to countries with high GDP per capita. However, in the late 19th century, Uruguay falls into their definition of a high GDP per capita country, along with Argentina, Australia, Canada and New Zealand.


8
an inflow of capital, since investors knew that the monetary authority would do whatever it
took to defend parity, and this capital inflow would itself return the exchange rate to normal
levels (McKinnon, 1993: 8; Eichengreen, 2008: 30-31).
Preserving the exchange rate meant the ratio of paper notes to gold reserves had to remain
relatively steady over the long run.7 The monetary authorities were supposed to adjust the
money supply in the same direction as changes in gold reserves. As gold reserves accumulated,
they had to lower interest rates and expand credit, causing the money supply to expand, and as
gold reserves were drawn down, rates would be raised and credit restricted, reducing the money
supply. This was referred to as following the “rules of the game”, and was believed to explain
in part why the gold standard was so successful, in that it would aid the adjustments in the
balance of payments necessary to keep price levels in line between countries (Bloomfield,
1959; Bordo, 1999: 34). This meant governments and central banks had to subordinate other
policy objectives, such as smoothing external shocks, supporting economic activity and
maintaining employment levels, to exchange rate stability. This was possible because limited
suffrage and weak labor organization in the 19th century meant they were relatively free from
political pressures (Eichengreen, 2008: 2).
However, examination of the actual behavior of central banks during the period shows that
they did entertain multiple policy objectives and that, more often than not, at least in the short
run, the rules of the game were not followed. Credit often moved in the opposite direction of
changes in gold reserves and central banks did not adjust their discount rates in line with those
of other countries (Bloomfield, 1959; Bordo, 1999: 34; Ogren, 2012: 5-7, Bazot et al., 2022).
It appears they sterilized gold flows in order to shield their economies from volatility that would
otherwise be imported through the balance of payments. They did this by building up gold
reserves or by manipulating the gold points8 in order to gain breathing room within which to
operate a countercyclical monetary policy. Faced with a large change in gold reserves, the role
of the central bank was to decide whether it was temporary, and try to smooth its effect on the
money supply, or due to fundamental causes, and thus follow the rules of the game (Sayers,
1957: 111). In other words, countercyclical balance sheet management could not be applied
indefinitely, as eventually the bank would run up against the balance of payments constraints;
7 It also meant that deposit money had to maintain a stable relationship with the country’s gold reserves, although the role of deposits is often given little attention, in not ignored entirely, in the literature on the rules of the game. 8 The gold points were upper and lower limits withing which the exchange rate could vary. They were determined by the cost of shipping gold abroad or of importing it (Officer, 1986; Bordo, 1999: 9)


9
over the long-run the rules of the game had to be respected, but over the short-run, they could
be broken.
1.2.2 The gold standard in peripheral countries
The above paragraphs describe how the gold standard worked in the core economies of the
system. For peripheral countries, things operated very differently, due largely to the nature of
their international insertion and institutional structures that made adherence much more
difficult. To begin with, short-term capital flows did not react to changes in exchanges the same
way they did for core countries. The movement of short-term capital into an advanced economy
when exchanges weakened was based on the confidence of investors in the monetary
authorities and the centrality of those countries in international financial networks
(Eichengreen, 2008: 30-31; Flandreau and Jobst, 2005). For peripheral countries, confidence
in their commitment to the gold standard and their ability to maintain a fixed exchange rate in
the face of a gold drain was much less, and they therefore did not receive compensating short
term capital inflows
In addition, peripheral countries were generally long-term capital importers. Low domestic
savings and immature financial markets created a dependence of foreign capital for growth.
These countries often specialized in exporting a limited range of primary products.9 Prices for
these goods were set in international markets, and could fluctuate dramatically with respect to
import prices (also set abroad). Thus, terms of trade were volatile for the periphery. Foreign
investors followed events in borrowing countries closely, and capital flows could cease
abruptly if economic news turned sour (Ford, 1962; Catão, 2007). This meant the
disappearance of a major source of financing for imports and of foreign exchange. In addition,
interest on public debt and a portion of private debt was fixed, so debt service requirements
remained inflexible. This meant that in the face of a fall in export prices or a sudden stop in
capital inflows there was no compensating force to equilibrate the balance of payments, and
that adjustment often had to occur through a fall in imports.10 For a country on the gold
standard, currency depreciation was not an option, and import compression had to be achieved
through painful reductions in income (Ford, 1962).
9 For example, for Latin America between 1870 and 1913, the top three products of each country made up between one half and two thirds of their total exports (Bértola and Ocampo, 2010: 99). 10 Debt default could relieve pressure on the balance of payments, but was not an option if the country desired to maintain access capital markets in the near future.


10
For peripheral countries outside Europe, a further complication was a lack of central banks.
While in much of the European periphery central banks were founded in the 19th century,
countries further afield did not establish these institutions until at least the 1920s (Ogren, 2012:
7; Marichal and Fuentes, 1999). Although large, state banks were common, they did not
necessarily have a monopoly of note issue and other tools available to European style central
banks.11 Multiple competitive note-issuing banks would have been more likely to follow the
rules of the game (Ford, 1989: 209), thus relinquishing the possibility of shielding the domestic
economy from external shocks. Consequently, remaining on the gold standard implied
absorbing the full brunt of external volatility.
Given the challenges that peripheral countries faced, why attempt to fix the value of their
currency to gold? One reason was trade. By reducing exchange rate risk and thereby lowering
transaction costs, trade with other countries on gold was facilitated (Meissner and Lopez
Cordova, 2003; Flandreau and Maurel, 2005). A fixed exchange rate could also increase access
to international capital markets. There is evidence that countries on the gold standard could
market public debt in Europe at lower rates than non-gold standard countries (Bordo and
Rockoff, 1996; Meissner, 2004). This was because being on the gold standard tied the
government’s hands, and thus acted as a signal to investors of their fiscal and monetary
prudence. The restraints placed on the government could have domestic benefits as well, in
terms of more stable prices (Bordo, 1999: 2). Non-economic motives could also factor in; the
gold standard was considered “the most modern monetary system”, and countries sought to
abandon backwards bimetallic or fiat currency systems for the prestige of gold (Yeager, 1984:
657).
1.2.3 Financial history and the problem facing Latin America in the first globalization
Until recently, financial history has been largely left aside by economic historians of Latin
America (Marichal and Gambi, 2017). This is somewhat surprising, since the role of the
financial sector in the development of capitalism and state formation has long been considered
important to historians of Europe. For example, Rostow (1960) identifies the modernization of
financial markets as a key condition for takeoff of capitalist economies. The immaturity of
financial systems in Latin America in the 19th century cries out to be explored as part of the
11 According to Marichal and Fuentes (1999: 2), there was “considerable experimentation with forms of central banking throughout [Latin America]”, but none of the state banks in existence in the 19th century became central banks. See Tedde and Marichal (1994) for a discussion of the formation of state banks in various Latin American countries.


11
explanation for the slow development of the region. In the second half of the 19th century, Latin
America was a veritable laboratory of experimentation in financial and monetary organization,
where the problem of banks, money and the state were closely intertwined.
In contrast to an earlier literature which had emphasized the impact of British banking, which
arrived in the 1860s, between 1850 and 1873, over 80 domestic banks were founded in the
more dynamic economies of Latin America, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Peru, Cuba
and Uruguay (Marichal, 2022: 210). These tended to be concentrated in the capitals and major
ports. The difficulties states had in exerting control over the countryside and continued armed
conflicts at first prevented banking from becoming a national phenomenon.
Banks met the demand for credit of various agents: those linked to the new export sectors, such
as grain and beef products in Argentina, guano in Peru and sugar and tabaco in Cuba, as well
as the urban classes that arose in growing cities. In addition, despite the lack of banks in the
countryside, discounting of bills, paper currency and deposits allowed credit to extend to the
agricultural centers, sometimes through informal mechanisms connected to merchant circuits
(Marichal, 2022: 212-13).
The state was also a major client of nascent banks, with treasuries depositing funds and
governments taking on loans. Indeed, states promoted the organization of banks for such
purposes, and the relationship between banks and the state was not always voluntary. During
wartime, especially, states obliged banks to fund spending, often exempting them from
prudential regulations designed to limit inflationary overissue of banknotes.
The organization of the banking system and bank legislation itself tended to be inspired by
European experiences, and was often part of a larger suite of liberal policies intended to
guarantee property rights and reduce uncertainty in politically chaotic times. One important
element was whether banknote issue should be dispersed among multiple private banks, or
whether it should be concentrated in the hands of one bank, either owned by the state or with
some elements of public control. This debate took place in Europe in the 19th century, with a
variety of configurations arising (Dowd, 1992). As Marichal (2022: 301) points out, in contrast
to Europe, this debate took place in Latin America at the same time, or even before, the first
banks were being founded.
For example, the first modern bank in Chile was founded in 1855 and the second in 1859,
concurrently with a series of laws designed to create a liberal framework for business and


12
finance, including the Mortgage Bank Law of 1855 and the General Banking Law of 1860
(Marichal, 2022: 312). These established one of the least restrictive bank regimes in existence
at the time, and led to the opening of upwards of 20 banks over the next decades (Marichal,
2022: 318). This experience ended in 1878, when inconvertibility of banknotes was declared,
and the Treasury began issuing its own banknotes.
Argentina provides a counter example. The Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, founded
in the early 20th century, fought off the free banking lobby and gained a monopoly on paper
currency issue early on, with its notes circulating widely in the capital, and less so in the interior
of the country, which relied on metallic coins from neighboring Bolivia and Chile (Cortés
Conde, 1989: 19-21). This bank helped Argentina join the gold standard in 1867, although the
experience was short lived, with inconvertibility of notes declared in 1876. The Banco
Nacional was founded in 1872, also with the privilege of note issue, although it struggled to
compete with the Banco de la Provincia de Buenos Aires until the 1880s. An 1887 law
permitted provincial banks to issue notes as well, but rather than a return to free banking, it
was more a scheme for the national government to access gold through foreign loans received
by the provincial governments (Cortés Conde, 1989: 195-204). The experiment ended with the
crisis of 1890; in its aftermath, a strict currency board was established, which remained in
existence until 1936.12
The debates over banking organization often revolved around protecting the value of the
currency and avoiding inflation. Governments could be ravenous in their need for financing,
and, if not able to raise sufficient funds through taxation or public debt sales, often sought loans
from the banking sector. A large state bank could be a convenient partner for the government,
but, in exchange for large loans of questionable soundness, sometimes sought certain
privileges, such as a monopoly of note issue. Free banking was seen as a way to guard against
abuse of monetary issue by the state, and an arms-length distance between governments and
banks was often written into the law (Schuler, 1992: 22-26).
The problem of convertibility of notes was tied up with issue of the organization of the banking
sector. Private currency issuing banks could not make their notes legal tender, and thus had to
provide backing in some desirable commodity (Schuler, 1992: 21). In the late 19th century, as
most of Europe and other countries moved from bimetallism to gold, this meant that convertible
12 See Marichal (2022: 299-358) for an extensive discussion of free banking in Latin America, and further country examples.


13
notes had to be backed by the scarce metal, thus creating the challenges described in the
preceding section.
However, Latin America’s various experiments in free banking were extinguished over time,
as the needs for banking services on the part of governments and some semblance of control
over money and credit grew when economies became more sophisticated. Multiple currency
issuing banks gave way to the concentration of note issue in large, state banks or in currency
boards (Marichal, 2022). In the early 20th century, the lessons of earlier successes and failures
were incorporated into these new monetary configurations, which presided over several years
of high economic growth and which allowed several countries to adopt the gold standard
definitively, until its international collapse in 1914.13
1.3 The gold standard in Uruguay
In some ways, Uruguay had certain advantages when it came to the gold standard. It had
relatively high GDP per capita during the gold standard period, the highest in Latin America
and comparable to that of the US and the core countries of Europe in the 1870s, and still around
60% to 80% of core country GDP per capita by 1913 (Bértola, 2000: 59). Uruguay’s GDP also
grew at an average annual rate of 3.9% from 1870 to 1913, higher than the average rate for
Latin America of 3.5% (Bertola and Ocampo, 2012: 97). In addition, the country was Latin
America’s sixth largest exporter by value throughout the period, and in the top four in terms of
export value per capita (Bértola and Ocampo, 2010: 88). High and rising incomes would have
made adjustments under the gold standard more bearable for the average person, while high
exports would have been a draw for foreign investment directed towards developing the
country’s resources.
However, Uruguay also suffered from the disadvantages faced by most peripheral countries.
Highly dependent on trade and a price taker in international markets, it was vulnerable to
external shocks. Dependence on capital flows added another source of volatility, and meant
that there were no equilibrating forces to bring the balance of payments back into equilibrium
when facing, for example, a fall in export prices or a sudden stop in capital flows. Despite this,
Uruguay made its first attempt to join the gold standard in the 1860s, and was successful in
doing so from 1876 to 1914.
13 Argentina re-entered the gold standard in 1900 and Brazil in 1906. Other countries joined for the first time: Peru in 1901, Mexico in 1905 and Bolivia in 1908 (Reinhart and Rogoff, 2010).


14
1.3.1 The institutional aspects of the gold standard in Uruguay
The country’s first banks were founded in 1857, as currency issuing banks, backing notes in
gold and silver. The gold standard was made law in Uruguay in March of 1865, when silver
was demonetized, except as a fractional currency. The three main stipulations of the Banking
Law were: 1) banks needed a charter from the government to operate, usually given for 20
years, 2) banknote issue was limited to three times the paid-up capital and 3) notes had to be
converted to gold on sight at the exchange rate set by the government, with failure to do so
leading to the immediate closure and liquidation of the bank. The law also prohibited the
government from obliging banks to lend it money. It allowed for minting of gold coins, but this
never occurred.14 No other limits were placed on bank balance sheets. In other words, what we
could today call ‘prudential regulation’ was essentially absent; there were no minimum reserve
ratios with respect to note issue or deposits, and there were no solvency ratios in terms of credit
with respect to reserves. This regulatory framework operated essentially unchanged, albeit with
some lapses, until Uruguay exited the gold standard in 1914.
Thus, from the founding of the first banks in 1857, the country operated a system of multiple
private currency issuing banks, which faced almost no regulation or government interference.
However, in general, banks maintained high reserve ratios. Those that didn’t were punished by
gold withdrawals on the part of clients or other banks presenting their notes for conversion.
Moments of crises were generally associated with some banks behaving imprudently,
increasing liabilities and credit beyond what their reserves merited.
The first lapse came in 1865, the same year the Banking Law was passed, when the government
broke its own rules, forcing the Banco Mauá and the Banco Comercial15 to extend it a loan of
100,000 pounds to finance military spending. The government returned the favor by declaring
the inconvertibility of banknotes that same year, since it was not in a position to repay the loan
in a timely manner (Acevedo, 1903: 313). The following years were tumultuous for Uruguay,
with moments of economic expansion followed by severe crises, prompting several more
inconvertibility decrees. In 1871 convertibility was reestablished, but an unknown quantity of
depreciated banknotes circulated alongside convertible notes (Acevedo, 1903: 217-18).
14 Silver, copper and nickel coins were minted as small change. 15 These were Uruguay’s first two banks, both founded in 1857 (Acevedo, 1933a: 697-98).


15
From its founding, the Banco Mauá had acted as the state’s main banking agent, lending it
money and handling its foreign debt. By 1875 the bank was completely overextended, and a
major crisis that year forced the government to declare inconvertibility once again (Acevedo,
1903: 240). However, this action was resisted by the rest of the banking and merchant
community, which demonetized the notes of the offending bank and refused to do business
with anyone who dared to use them. In 1876 the Mauá was liquidated and convertibility
reestablished, with the military government which came to power that year instituting a policy
of purchasing and burning all old inconvertible notes.
What followed was a period where few banks, controlled by the merchant elite and which
maintained their distance from the government, managed the country’s monetary system.
However, the tension between the desire to shield the banks from government intervention and
the needs of the state for financing were ever present. In 1887, the Banco Nacional was
founded. It was privately owned, although its director was appointed by the government, and
was to handle the state’s accounts and the public debt. It overissued banknotes and credit, due
in part to its close ties to the government, which came to its rescue with another inconvertibility
decree during a major crisis in 1890. Once again, the banking and merchant community
resisted, demonetizing the inconvertible notes and forcing the government to backpedal and
reestablish that all contracts would be honored in gold (Acevedo, 1903: 268). This episode, in
1890, led to one of the worst financial crises in the country’s history and to the government’s
default on external debt in 1891 (Bertino and Millot, 1996: 414).
Although opposition to inconvertibility remained strong, so did the desire for a state bank. In
1896, the Banco de la República (BROU) was founded, essentially owned by the government,
to act as a state bank and with the mission of extending credit to previously neglected sectors.
It appears policymakers learned some important lessons from earlier experiences, and strict
limits were placed on the BROU’s capacity to issue notes and deposits (Acevedo, 1934b: 66
67; Barrán and Nahum, 1978: 75-108).
The only major regulatory change was the loss of the right of note issue on the part of private
banks. This occurred gradually, with the government refusing to issue new charters containing
the privilege after 1890. The two private banks with note issue rights to survive the crisis -the
London and River Plate Bank and the Banco Italiano- were allowed to keep doing so until their
charters ran out in 1904 and 1907, respectively (their charters were renewed, but without the
note issuing privilege) (Acevedo, 1934b: 482).


16
Thus, in 1907, the BROU became the sole paper currency issuer, and quickly became the
country’s largest commercial bank. Although not quite a central bank, it acted as the monetary
authority and was able to avoid the pitfalls of the state banks of earlier decades. It successfully
stewarded the economy in prosperous years of the early 20th century, and through the collapse
of the gold standard in 1914 (Acevedo, 1936: 218-223).
This brief sketch of the evolution of the banking and monetary system will be expanded upon
in Chapter 2 of this thesis, but it serves here to highlight some of the most salient characteristics
of the system: the establishment of the gold standard in 1865, and it’s continued adherence
from 1876 to 1913; a multiple currency issuing bank system from the founding of the first
banks until 1907; minimal government intervention regarding private banks, and essentially no
prudential regulation; and several experiments with large, state banks, some which ended in
disaster, until the rise of the BROU in the 20th century.
1.3.2 The gold standard in the Uruguayan historiography
The uniqueness of Uruguay in adopting the gold standard so early in its history, and in adhering
to it until 1914, is highlighted by the country’s historiography. Among the explanations for
why the country held so dearly to this system are: the political instability of the early and mid
19th century, which created the psychological conditions for gold to be seen as a beacon of
stability, the conservatism of the Montevideo merchant community and the pressure from
European capital exporters who wanted to ensure the country’s debts would be repaid in gold
(Barrán and Nahum, 1987: 80-83). However, the main reason given is that it was in the interest
of the “alto comercio”, the merchant elite that controlled the regional transit trade. They
imported manufactured goods from Europe and used the port of Montevideo as a hub from
which to distribute them beyond Uruguay’s borders, to nearby regions of Argentina, Brazil and
Paraguay, often bypassing the tariffs levied by those countries. These merchants and their
financiers represented European interests, and had a strong interest in transacting in gold
(Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 444-48; 1987: 83).
Views differ on the consequences of Uruguay’s adherence to the gold standard. Eduardo
Acevedo (1903; 1933b; 1934a), a contemporary of the period studied in this thesis, and one of
Uruguay’s greatest economic historians, argues that a gold backed currency was beneficial for
the republic, and a part of a suite of liberal policies that promoted foreign investment, the
development of the country’s resources and a flourishing commerce. Barrán and Nahum (1971;


17
1978), writing several decades later and from a dependentista tradition, take a much different
view. For them, the gold standard was the face of imperialism and represented a monopoly of
financial resources by the foreign aligned merchant elite (Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 452).
Here, the issues of the gold standard, the government and the structure of the banking sector
are closely tied. For Acevedo (1903: 332-41), the greatest danger to financial stability and a
sound currency was the state, since the temptation to monetize debt would be irresistible. Total
separation between the state and the banks was the only way to limit over issue of paper
currency and to guarantee gold convertibility. This meant that the push to establish a large bank
with special privileges to serve the government, as was common in other countries, had to be
resisted.16 In contrast, for Barrán and Nahum (1971), leaving credit in the hands of foreign
controlled private banks meant renouncing financial sovereignty.17 The crux of the issue wasn’t
whether the currency was backed by gold or not, but to what use the country’s metallic reserves
were put. In order to break the stranglehold that the merchant elite had on credit, the state
needed its own bank -with special privileges- that could wrest scarce reserves away from the
private banks and direct them towards developing the country’s resources. Montero
Bustamante and Morató18 view the country’s history with state banks as a learning experience.
For them, the founding of the BROU “constitutes the culmination and solution of a long and
troubled historical process”19 regarding state banks (BROU, 1918: 32)
Real de Azúa (1984: 41) highlights the problem that a fixed exchange rate represented for the
livestock sector. In Argentina, a depreciating paper currency meant falling wage costs and
diminishing debt burdens for cattle ranchers, while at the same time they received income in
gold. Uruguayan ranchers had no such privilege, and, according to this author, were thus much
slower to invest in improvements in land and cattle stocks. He traces the late entrance of
meatpacking plants in Uruguay, 20 years after they had already been established in Argentina,
to the handicap that the gold standard put on the livestock sector.
16 Acevedo (1903: 340) went so far as to argue for the full privatization of the BROU, the state bank founded in 1896 after the failures of the Banco Mauá in 1875 and the Banco Nacional in 1890, both instances in which the country was submerged into economic ruin. The BROU, however, was not privatized, and would go on to become not only the state’s main financial agent, but also the most important commercial bank, a primary organ of the country’s industrialization project in the mid-20th century and, by the 1950’s, the country’s central bank. It is in fact still in existence today as the country’s largest commercial bank. 17 The only two banks to survive the 1875 crisis were the Banco Comercial and the Uruguayan branch of the London and River Plate Bank. The first was controlled primarily by British merchants residing in Uruguay. The second was owned by shareholders in London. 18 These were the authors of the BROU’s memoir published in 1918 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of its founding, and were also employees of the bank. 19 Own translation from Spanish.

1.4 Map of this thesis
As mentioned above, the objective of this thesis is to explore how Uruguay adhered to the gold
standard for 38 years almost without interruption. To this end, empirical evidence regarding
many of the macroeconomic variables that are important for understanding the gold standard
has been assembled. This involves a reconstruction of Uruguay’s annual balance of payments,
including new estimates of capital inflows and the services and unilateral transfers balances
from 1870 to 1914. Annual data on the balance sheet of the banking sector, including capital,
specie reserves, notes in circulation, deposits and credit, is reconstructed for the same time
period. Estimates of gold stocks, and their distribution between the banking sector and the
public are also developed for the period 1880-1900. In addition, high frequency data on key
financial variables -the domestic market discount rate, the exchange rate for bills on London
and gold flows- are presented. Microeconomic evidence is also employed, especially in regard
to the banking sector. Data on reserves, notes in circulation, deposits and credit of several banks
that operated during the period is collected and used to discuss banking sector liquidity, a key
determinant of gold standard adherence. The empirical evidence offered represents one of the
main contributions of this thesis.
The three main chapters of this thesis explore the questions discussed in section 1.1: how did
the gold standard actually operate in Uruguay and what were the consequences of adherence.
Chapter 2 examines the issue of the rules of the game under a multiple currency issuing bank
system. Evidence is presented that, contrary to the theoretical assumptions of the literature,
some banks in Uruguay adjusted credit countercyclically with respect to gold reserves in an
attempt to smooth volatility of money and credit for their clients. Furthermore, their efforts
may have had economy-wide effects. Econometric evidence is offered showing that domestic
discount rates did not react to changes in international rates as predicted for an economy where
banks followed the rules of the game. On the contrary, domestic interest rates were highly
insensitive to changes in international rates.
Chapter 3 takes a macro level approach, looking at one of the main sources of external
volatility, capital flows, and analyzes how the balance of payments and the money supply
adjusted to changes in this variable. It suggests that, first, Uruguay was not the model student
in terms of the gold standard. It came close to exiting more than once, in large part due to
episodes of massive monetary expansion far beyond what gold reserves warranted. This caused


19
economic havoc, contributing to sudden stops, which let to major current account adjustments
through import compression and reduced economic activity.
Chapter 4 looks more closely at one episode of capital inflows, the leadup to the 1890 crisis
(also known as the Baring Crisis). It compares Uruguay to its neighbor, Argentina. Both
countries underwent economic expansions during the 1880s, led by foreign investment booms
with very similar characteristics. They also both experienced a severe crisis in 1890. However,
Uruguay was on the gold standard, while Argentina operated with an inconvertible paper
currency. The chapter examines the evolution of the boom and crisis in each country in
comparative perspective, focusing on the consequences of their differing exchange rate
regimes. In many ways, gold standard adherence appears to have offered Uruguay some
benefits during this period. Prices were much more stable than in Argentina and the banking
sector seems to have been in general healthier, although some banks behaved imprudently,
eventually contributing to the financial collapse and putting the exchange rate at risk. In
addition, the fixed exchange rate allowed Uruguay to avoid the erosion of fiscal revenues that
plagued its neighbor. Finally, Uruguay’s more secure banking system may have attracted gold
east from Argentina, bolstering the reserves of banks and contributing to the country’s ability
to adhere to the gold standard.
The results of this thesis show that, in general terms, gold standard adherence placed important
limits on a peripheral country like Uruguay. Over the long run, the rules of the game had to be
respected, meaning the money supply had to stay in line with gold reserves. When it didn’t, the
consequence was sudden stops, major current account reversals and negative effects on growth.
However, the fixed exchange rate may have offered certain advantages beyond those
commonly highlighted by the literature (ease of trade and access to capital markets on better
terms). The gold standard allowed the government to avoid the erosion of fiscal revenues
caused by currency depreciation. This was important, since foreign debt service was fixed in
gold terms. Strict convertibility forced banks to manage reserves prudently; this in turn may
have attracted gold to Uruguay its neighbor, Argentina, that was on inconvertible paper
currency.
The idea that, in the short run, central banks followed the rules of the game has long been
debunked. Central banks had more than one objective: exchange rate stability was paramount,
but so was smoothing external volatility. However, the literature generally does not address


20
how countries without central banks managed these issues, and in fact assumes that they were
more faithful followers of the rules of the game. The results of this thesis point in the opposite
direction. It appears that private banks in Uruguay acted in ways similar to European central
banks, using countercyclical balance sheet management to reduce volatility that would
otherwise be imported through the balance of payments.
The implications of these results go beyond the issue of how Uruguay adhered to the gold
standard. They touch on issues regarding the benefits of the gold standard for countries outside
Europe, the importance of financial links between peripheral countries on different exchange
rate regimes and the applicability of the “rules of the game” for countries without a central
bank. These implications, as well as an agenda for future research, are discussed in the final
chapter of this thesis.

Chapter 2: The Gold standard and the Rules of the Game in the Periphery: The Uruguayan Experience
2.1 Introduction
The Mundell-Fleming policy trilemma suggests that a country can have two, but not all three,
of the following: fixed exchange rates, free movement of capital and an independent monetary
policy. Under the classical gold standard, which was defined by the practice of linking paper
currency to gold at a fixed exchange rate and by the relative lack of restrictions on international
capital movements, independent monetary policy should have been severely limited (Triffin,
1947: 54). Changes in the money supply would have to move in the same direction as gold
flows, which in turn were dictated by the balance of payments, lest convertibility of paper notes
into gold be put at risk. Indeed, the first models of the operation of the gold standard, the price
specie-flow mechanism laid out by Hume, and later extensions, predicted just that. The money
supply would move in proportion to changes in the gold stock, helped along by central banks
which would have to follow the “rules of the game”, adjusting credit and interest rates in a way
that would cause changes in the money supply to move in the required direction (Bordo, 1999:
31-32; Eichengreen, 2008: 27).20
However, one of the main findings of the literature of the last decades regarding the classical
gold standard has been to dispel the myth that the central banks abided strictly by the “rules of
the game”. It was already argued by Bloomfield (1959) that central banks in many countries
shielded their economies from international shocks by sterilizing gold inflows and by
expanding domestic credit when facing gold drains. The costs of shipping gold overseas, as
well as the occasional application of institutional impediments to gold movements, created a
band within which exchanges could fluctuate without triggering gold exports or imports. This
gave Central banks room to apply limited countercyclical monetary policies, sterilizing gold
inflows or cushioning the deflationary effects of gold outflows. These institutions were able to
do this due to their central position in the banking market and their monopoly on paper currency
20 See Eichengreen (2008: 27-28) for a discussion of the different factors, apart from the balance of payments, which influenced central bank credit and interest rates.


22
emission, which allowed them to manipulate the discount rate and affect the volume of credit
(Bloomfield, 1959: 27). Numerous country case studies, as well as cross cross-country
analyses, have confirmed this intuition.21 Morys (2013) and Bazot et al. (2022) provide multi
country statistical analyses that support the idea that central banks in gold standard countries
practice volatility smoothing. In countries without central banks, however, adjustments were
processed in a decentralized way, by commercial banks. It is believed these banks adhered
more strictly to the rules of the game, in part because competitive pressures would have given
them less room to maneuver (Ford, 1989: 209; Eichengreen, 2008: 38). This chapter sheds
doubt on this last assertion, through the study of Uruguay, a small, peripheral country that
adhered to the gold standard almost continuously from 1876 to 1914, with no central bank
before 1907.
One important aspect of the gold standard world was that peripheral countries had certain
disadvantages in maintaining fixed exchange rates, which explains why so many of these
countries struggled to stay on the gold standard (Ford, 1962; Triffin, 1947; Eichengreen, 2008:
37-41). For core countries, long-term capital outflows tended to generate demand for exports,
relieving pressure on the balance of payments, while short-term capital flowed in during critical
moments, under the expectation that the monetary authorities would do everything necessary
to maintain gold parity and preserve their reputation. In the periphery, there were no such
equilibrating forces. A fall in exports often coincided with a reduction of capital inflows, and
being primary goods producers, these countries faced fixed international prices for their exports
and for imports of manufactures and capital goods, meaning there was little scope for internal
price changes and adjustments had to occur through changes in income, with consequent
pressures for changes in policy (Ford, 1962).
Furthermore, core countries tended to have large, long-established institutions -central banks
that helped manage monetary affairs and maintain the fixed exchange rate. These institutions
were less common in peripheral countries. Some areas in the European periphery, such as the
Scandinavian countries, also had large banks with privileged relationships with the state that
took on central banking functions. These countries had a certain degree of success in adhering

to the gold standard. In Latin America, central banks were generally not established until the
20th century (Goodhart, 1988; Marichal and Fuentes, 1999).
This view of the asymmetries between core and peripheral countries, and the role of central
banks, in regard to the gold standard predicts that a small, peripheral country like Uruguay,
with no central bank, should have had a difficult time maintaining a fixed exchange rate.
Uruguay was particularly exposed to external shocks due to its trade openness22 and
dependence on capital inflows. However, the country managed to link its currency to gold at a
fixed rate from 1876 until 1914, with only a brief suspension during the 1890 crisis, after which
it returned to gold backed currency at its previous par value. In fact, it was the only Latin
American country to maintain the gold standard for more than a short period of time.23 Uruguay
did not have anything like a central bank for most of this period. Multiple currency emitting
banks operated until 1907, the year when the state-owned Banco de la República (BROU)
acquired a monopoly on currency emission. Adhering to the Gold standard under these
conditions should have implied great sacrifice in terms of internal stability. The country was
self-sufficient in food, but imported most manufactures and capital goods. Without a flexible
exchange rate, external shocks would have been processed through changes in incomes and
non-traded goods prices (Ford, 1962). Under these conditions, temptation to leave the gold
standard would have been strong. How did Uruguay maintain a fixed exchange rate for so long?
The claim of this chapter is that two private banks, -the Banco Comercial and the Uruguayan
Branch of the London and River Plate Bank (LRP)-, consistently broke the rules of the game,
changing their volume of credit in the opposite direction as metallic reserves. The intention
may have been to smooth fluctuations in credit and the money supply for their clients, mostly
businessmen involved in international trade, but their actions had an economy-wide effect,
reducing volatility that otherwise would have been imported through the balance of payments.
In this sense, these banks appear to have played a role similar to that of central banks in other
gold standard countries, and this can partially explain Uruguay’s success in maintaining a fixed
exchange rate for so many years.
22 Uruguay had the highest ratio of exports to GDP, in 1870-74 and in 1910-1914, of the eight largest Latin American economies in those years (Bértola and Ocampo, 2010). 23 Argentina has the second longest record, maintaining the Gold standard from 1882 to 1884 and from 1899 to 1913 (Della Paolera and Taylor, 2001). Other countries were on gold for less time, with many Latin American economies joining only in the early 20th century.


24
To this end, two types of evidence are provided. First, the balance sheets of several banks are
examined, showing that the reserve management with respect to credit and bank created money
of the Comerical and LRP was heavily countercyclical before 1907. In other words, during the
free banking period, these two banks did not play by the rules of the game, in contradiction to
what the literature predicts. Second, a VAR model is used to test the reaction of the domestic
discount rate to shocks in international interest rates. The rate at which international shocks
were incorporated into local discount rates is low, similar to rates found in gold standard
countries with central banks that actively practiced volatility smoothing.
The traditional answer to how the country stayed on the gold standard found in the Uruguayan
historiography has been that the banking sector was dominated by forces that staunchly
defended currency convertibility, at the expense of the credit needs of the domestic economy
(Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 444-52; Barrán and Nahum, 1987; Visca, 1967). Specifically, for
most of the period, the main banks would have directed their resources primarily towards short
term commercial transactions, shying away from longer-term, higher risk loans and mortgages
that could have aided the rural sector, especially smaller scale establishments. The authors that
defend this position tend to see the country’s development during the period in a negative light;
they say modernization was slow and that this retarded agricultural and industrial development.
They lay part of the blame for this on the class of men engaged in international commerce and
the banks they controlled. The main culprits of this narrative are the Banco Comercial and the
LRP, mentioned above. They were the two oldest banks in operation during the period, and
historically had been defenders of gold backed currency, resisting attempts by the government
to ease credit or found state banks which may abuse their position and put the gold standard at
risk (Barrán and Nahum, 1971).
The hypothesis put forward in this chapter regarding these two banks and the rules of the game
is not necessarily at odds with the view detailed in the preceding paragraph. These banks may
well have restricted credit to certain sectors that were deemed too risky and focused resources
on short-term trade finance, but they also behaved in a way that smoothed volatility for their
clients that otherwise would have been imported through the balance of payments. The point
is that these two banks did not behave in a single-mindedly competitive way. They appear to
have taken a long-term view, perhaps sacrificing a degree of short-term profitability, in order
to maintain stability of financial resources for their clients.


25
The rest of this chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 offers a brief description of the
evolution of the monetary and banking system in Uruguay from its founding in the 1850s up
to 1913. Section 3 analyzes the balance sheets of Uruguayan banks, showing that the Comercial
and the LRP engaged in countercyclical behavior with regard to gold reserves and credit,
different from what other banks were doing. In addition, the effect of this policy on bank
liabilities is examined, showing that fluctuations in note circulation and deposits were lower
for these banks than for others. Section 4 develops a VAR model which examines the
relationship between domestic and international interest rates. Section 5 discusses the specific
conditions which may have allowed these banks to escape the need to play by the rules of the
game. The final section offers some concluding remarks.
2.2 The evolution of the monetary and banking system in Uruguay
2.2.1 The beginnings of a banking system and the adoption of the gold standard
The general outlines of Uruguay’s monetary system were established in the 1862 Monetary
Law, which fixed the gold value of the Uruguayan peso, and the 1865 Banking Law which,
among other things, officially instituted gold convertibility, thus putting Uruguay on the Gold
standard (Acevedo, 1903: 287).24 Silver and other metals were still allowed to be used in
payments, but only in small fractions of the total amount owed, thus serving as a way to
augment the supply of small denomination coins.25 Although minting of gold coins was
provided for in the law, it never occurred in Uruguay during the period. The economy relied
on the circulation of foreign coins and bills, as well as the emission of gold-backed paper
currency by local banks.
24 Throughout the 19th century, several laws upheld a bimetallist standard; an 1854 Law permitted the circulation of French, Spanish and Latin American gold and silver coins, as well as the minting of domestic pieces (Pivel Devoto, 1976: 79-80). The 1862 Law updated the system, redefining the metal content of the peso and establishing the exact exchange rates with different foreign coins based on their weight and metallic content, this time including US, British and other European currencies (Acevedo, 1903: 268-290). The Uruguayan peso was defined as 25.48 milligrams of silver at 917 fine, while the Uruguayan gold doubloon (valued at 10 pesos) was to contain 16.97 grams of gold at 917 fine. This implied the following exchange rates: Currency Value in Uruguayan pesos
Currency Value in Uruguayan pesos Ounce of gold 15.12 Spanish doubloon (100 reales) 4.82 British pound 4.7 20 marks 4.6 Argentine gold peso 0.93 20 francs 3.73 Source: Acevedo 1934 (volume IV): 73 25 For example, for payments of over 5,000 pesos (about 1,064 pounds), only 2% of the total could be paid in silver coins. Copper coins could also be used in small amounts, replaced by nickel in 1900 (Acevedo, 1903: 287).


26
The 1865 Banking Law limited note emission to three times the level of capital for all banks.
Gold convertibility was strictly imposed; the inability to convert paper currency on sight would
mean the immediate closure of the bank, with note holders having first claim on the bank’s
assets. Charters were to be given for twenty years at a time, and the government was prohibited
from forcing banks to offer it credit or from offering privileges to specific banks (Acevedo,
1903: 307-08). No other restrictions were placed on bank balances; in particular, minimum
ratios of metallic reserves in relation to note emissions or deposits were not required.
While these aspects of the monetary regime remained relatively unchanged over the period, the
banking system evolved significantly over time. 1857 saw the founding of Montevideo’s first
banks: the Banco de Mauá, named after the Brazilian financier who promoted it, and the Banco
Comercial, established by local merchants. The Mauá bank would be the main actor in the
sector until its collapse and liquidation in 1876. A third bank, a branch of the London and River
Plate, of British origin, began operating in 1863. Along with the Comercial, it was one of the
major players in the banking sector throughout the period. All were headquartered in the
capital, Montevideo, with some opening branches in the port cities of Mercedes, Paysandú and
Salto, on the Uruguay river (BROU, 1918: 15). The main activities of the banks included the
discounting of bills, short term loans, note issue and taking of deposits, although the Mauá
ventured further than the other two, taking on longer term lending and managing the
government’s first overseas debt issue.
However, in this early period, civil war threatened periodically, and external shocks, such as
the 1866 Overand Gurney crisis in England, upset local markets. Between 1865 and 1868, in
order to save overextended banks (primarily the Mauá bank), the government decreed the
inconvertibility of paper currency no less than four times.26 In March of 1875, due to another
crisis, convertibility was suspended once again (Acevedo, 1903: 240). This act was resisted by
most banks, in particular the Comercial and the LRP, as well as most of the other financial and
commercial houses, a pact being signed not to accept the inconvertible bills in circulation and
to operate only in gold.
26 In 1865 it was as a result of the blockade and bombardment of Montevideo by rebel forces. In 1866, inconvertibility was declared due the bank run caused by news of the Overand Gurney crisis in England. In December of 1867, cholera outbreaks, trouble in the livestock and agriculture markets and commercial shocks due to Argentina’s insistence that goods shipped from Uruguayan ports to the war zone in Paraguay pay duties in the Argentine river port of Corrientes, combined with over emissions by certain banks, prompted the government to declare inconvertibility for six months, and in June of 1868 again, this time for twenty months. (Acevedo, 1903: 217-18).


27
2.2.2 The re-founding of the gold standard and the disaster of 1890
1876 was a key year. A military government which had taken control the previous year reversed
the inconvertibility decree and instituted a policy of purchasing and burning all the old
inconvertible bills (Acevedo, 1903: 456-57).27 It also reintroduced the gold standard,
guaranteeing convertibility of paper currency to gold, and reducing the use of silver coins in
payments to minimal amounts. The liquidation of the Mauá that year left only two banks in
operation: the Comercial and the LRP. These banks tended to act conservatively, refusing to
lend to the government and shying away from other risky ventures, concentrating on financing
commerce through short term lending and discounting of bills, and operating in the foreign
exchange market (Joslin, 1963: 54; Banco Comercial, 1957). Throughout the period under
study, these two banks continued to operate and remained important players in the banking
sector.
They were joined by several more banks beginning in the early 1880s, the total number of
establishments reaching seven by 1887. An economic boom began in this year, fueled by
foreign investment, in which at least 25 new banks were founded, as well as dozens of utilities,
land, investment, and other companies, with a total capital estimated at 400 million pesos
(about 85 million pounds) (Acevedo, 1903: 261-63).28
The boom created demand for credit. It was argued that the Comercial and LRP, too
conservative in their business strategies, were monopolizing the country’s metallic reserves in
order to maintain their profits, at the cost of rural producers, the urban middle class and
entrepreneurs, who would build new enterprises if only they could access credit on easier terms.
The demand for a “national” bank, with a large amount of capital, special privileges and
government support, could no longer be resisted by the more conservative forces (Barrán and
Nahum, 1971: 460-62). Several proposals were studied by the government, including some
which tried to limit the negative impacts of a “national” bank and restrict its ties to the state.
These proposals lost out, however, to the less conservative sectors, who were not necessarily
opposed to remaining on the gold standard, but did hope to eliminate the traditional banks’
stranglehold on credit, if necessary, by expansion of paper currency beyond customary limits.
27 There were around 2,580,000 pounds worth of these notes in circulation in 1876. They were slowly amortized over the following years, with around 35,000 pounds still in circulation in 1890 (Acevedo, 1934a: 559). 28 Many of these companies were purely speculative ventures, and likely never operated.


28
Thus, in 1887, the Banco Nacional was founded, brainchild of the Spanish entrepreneur Emilio
Reus and a cadre of Anglo-Argentine capitalists (Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 464).29 The project
was supported by industrialists, the urban middle class and owners of small and medium sized
rural landholdings (Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 453-56). The main purpose of this bank was to
extend credit to customers that had thus far been shut out, and at rates that would promote the
productive use of the country’s resources.
The traditional banks reacted apprehensively to the Banco Nacional’s entrance and expansion
in the banking market. Indeed, the Comercial, whose paper currency had circulated
uninterrupted for 30 years, gave up its right to emission in 1887, so as not to expose itself to
what it considered the imprudence of the new bank and the risks this involved for the entire
sector (Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 475). It was supplanted by the Banco Italiano, founded that
year, which took the Comercial’s place as a note issuing bank. The Comercial and the LRP
also carried out a policy of presenting the Banco Nacional’s notes for conversion on a daily
basis,30 forcing that bank to maintain sufficient specie reserves and limiting their exposure in
case disaster struck (Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 474).31
The boom of the late 1880s turned to bust towards the end of 1889. The stock market collapsed,
in part due to knock on effects from the crisis in Argentina that same year. In July of 1890, the
overextended Nacional was not able to convert 400,000 pesos presented by the LRP, and the
bank was forced to suspend convertibility and was in liquidation by the following year (Bertino
and Millot, 1996: 448). As a result of the crisis, the government was forced to suspend debt
service in the second semester of 1891 (Bertino and Millot, 1996: 414). In 1892 a deal was
reached in which a 20-million-pound loan would be made available to refinance the Uruguayan
government’s debts, allowing it to resume debt payments (Nahum, 1991: 41-43).
29 The bank was to have a capital of 10 million pesos and would venture into activities which until that moment had been underserved by the banking community. It could emit paper currency up to two times its capital and was obligated to maintain a 25% specie reserve. It also would have a monopoly on the emission of small bills, with a limit of 40% of its capital. It would be divided into a commercial department and a mortgage department, the latter being able to make secured loans for up to 30 years and to emit “cédulas”, a financial instrument designed to facilitate land investments. A network of branches in every department was to be established. The Director of the bank was to be appointed by the government. In addition, the bank would run a current account for the government of up to 1.5 million pesos and handle public debt service at home and abroad (Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 465). 30 This, despite the government’s request for a pact to only convert bills once a week (Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 475). 31 Barrán and Nahúm (1971) suggest that this strategy was designed to bring down the Banco Nacional. However, this could have been merely a defensive strategy, so as not to be left holding inconvertible bills when the bank inevitably collapsed, rather than an attack on their competitor.


29
2.2.3 Recovery, expansion of the banking sector and the monopoly of note issue
The only currency emitting banks to make it through the crisis were the LRP, the Banco Italiano
and the Banco de España y Rio de la Plata (founded in 1887, during the boom years). The
Comercial, which had given up its role as a note emitting bank, still offered other banking
services, such as deposits, short term loans and discounting of commercial bills. Of these banks,
the LRP quickly became the most important, occupying the vacuum left by the Nacional and
English Bank of the River Plate, which were liquidated after the crisis (Joslin, 1963: 137). A
return to the conservative banking strategies of the late 1870s and early 1880s meant a restricted
money supply and limited credit.
However, by the mid-1890s, attitudes of landowners had changed (Barrán and Nahum, 1971:
523; Barrán and Nahum, 1987: 86-87), and calls for a more flexible monetary system were
answered by the founding of a new bank: the Banco de la República (BROU). It had some
similarities with the Banco Nacional: it would operate as the state’s bank, handling the
government’s accounts, debt payments and operating a current account for the government of
up to 5 million pesos. However, it was to be a mixed bank, with half of the initial capital of 10
million pesos to be paid by the government, while the other half was to be raised through the
sale of shares to private investors.32 It could emit paper currency up to twice its capital.
However, once the charters of the LRP and the Banco Italiano expired, they would not be
renewed as emissions banks, and the BROU would have a monopoly on paper currency
emissions. The restrictions on emissions were somewhat tighter than they had been for the
Banco Nacional; a specie reserve of 40% of notes in circulation plus deposits was to be kept at
all times.33 In addition, notes in circulation were not to exceed three times paid up capital, as
had been the rule for private banks since 1865. Furthermore, the bank was prohibited from
investing in company shares or participating in speculative activities.
The LRP’s charter ran out in 1904, while that of the Banco Italiano expired in 1907. Both were
renewed, but their right to issue banknotes was not. Thus, in 1907, the BROU, as the sole note
issuer left in the market, gained a monopoly on note issue, ending the era of free banking in
32 The board of directors was to be made up of a President, appointed by the government, and six members, also appointed by the government until the private shares were sold, at which time only two would be government appointees, while the rest elected by the shareholders. However, local investors were skeptical about the venture, and never purchased the shares which were to make up the other half of the bank’s capital. This meant that, in effect, the BROU was a state-owned bank, and in 1911 the bank’s charter was changed to institutionalize this fact, eliminating the possibility of private investment and increasing the bank’s capital through reinvestment of profits and through state funds (BROU, 1918: 93). 33 Reserve requirements were not established for private banks until 1938 (Díaz and Moreira, 2015).


30
Uruguay.34 It was charged with defending the exchange rate and promoting development of
agriculture and industry. It had legal permission to rediscount bills from other banks, although
this was never put into use before 1914, and then only in small amounts during the First World
War. From the time of the BROU’s founding up to 1913, it grew in importance as a commercial
bank, extending credit to the countryside and to the middle classes. By the time it assumed its
role as sole note issuer in 1907, it had about 40% of the metallic reserves of the banking sector
and 33% of the credit market. By 1913, these proportions were closer to 60% and 45%,
respectively. Beginning in the early 20th, new banks joined the market, reaching a total of 24
in 1913, more than double the number of institutions in existence immediately after the 1890
crisis.
The economy grew rapidly in the early years of the 20th century, GDP increasing by 7%
annually between 1900 and 1913 (own calculation based on Román and Willebald, 2019).
Under the stewardship of the BROU, the pitfalls of earlier growth episodes were avoided. For
one thing, the bank was well capitalized. The paid-up capital of over 1,000,000 pounds at its
founding had more than doubled by 1912, the year it was nationalized (Acevedo, 1934: 481).
Moreover, liabilities and credit were kept within the limits established in the banks charter.
Note issues never reached their limit of three times the bank’s capital, in part because of the
large increases in capitalization over the two decades after the BROU’s founding (BROU,
1918). The reserve ratio remained above 50% of liabilities until 1910, when it began to
deteriorate somewhat.
2.2.3 The collapse of the gold standard
By 1913, however, the financial situation in Uruguay was showing signs of weakness. Foreign
markets refused to roll over large amounts of foreign debt, causing heavy gold exports.
Domestic private banks began withdrawing gold from the BROU, causing the bank to
announce the suspension of all new credits. Despite this, reserves fell below the ratio of 40%
allowed under the bank’s charter, before recovering slightly by the end of the year (BROU,
1918: 95)
34 Whether or not the BROU became a central bank at this moment can be debated, and depends on one’s definition of a central bank. Many of the functions which we normally ascribe to a central bank were non-existent in Uruguay at this time, such as a clearing house, supervision of private banks and an active rediscount facility. These were developed over the course of the first half of the 20th century, but were not necessarily under the control of the BROU. See Jacob (2000) for a view of the changing role of the BROU over its life and Díaz and Moreira (2016) for a discussion of the evolution of central banking functions in Uruguay before the founding of the Banco Central del Uruguay in 1967.


31
In august of 1914, following edicts by the central banks or England, France, Germany and the
US restricting international loans, the government of Uruguay closed the Montevideo Stock
Market and all banks for a week. A few days later, it prohibited exports of gold, suspended
convertibility of the banknotes of the BROU, and made illegal all speculation regarding said
banknotes, on punishment of imprisonment. This effectively took Uruguay off the gold
standard (Acevedo, 1934b: 624).
The following years saw a series of measures for maintaining internal stability in the face of
the massive external disruption cause by the outbreak of WWI. Exchanges floated freely, with
the peso rising against the dollar until 1918, and against the pound until 1920, but depreciating
severely thereafter. In order to prevent reserve losses, gold exports were restricted, trade in
gold coins was prohibited and private banks were obligated to deposit their gold with the
BROU, thus fortifying the bank’s reserves (Acevedo, 1936: 218-223). In this way, the internal
exchange rate was kept stable, even though external rates fluctuated. Although not a full
fledged controlled exchange, this was a prelude to such system, that was to be implemented in
the 1930 and became one of the main axes of government control of the economy during
Uruguay’s state led industrialization period.
2.2.5 The structure of the Uruguayan banking system over time
The transition from multiple currency issuing banks to a system with a single monetary
authority was the most significant institutional innovation over the period. As mentioned
before, the regulation of private banks was almost non-existent, and changed very little before
1914. What did change was the structure of the banking system, with the number of banks
evolving rapidly over time. The number of banks in operation in Uruguay in each year from
1857 to 1913 can be seen in Figure 2.1.

From the founding of the first banks, both domestic and foreign capital operated in the sector.
Before 1876, foreign capital was preponderant, mainly due to Banco Mauá. After this year, the
market was split between the domestically owned Banco Comercial and the foreign owned
LRP. While several more British banks joined the market in the late 1880s, so did many
domestic banks, including the large Banco Nacional. The collapse of this bank, along with two
others, decreased total bank capital, and especially the share of domestic capital. Part of the
Banco Nacional was converted into the quasi-public Banco Hipotecario. This, along with the
founding of the BROU in 1896, meant that about half of banking sector capital was state
owned. This proportion diminished in the early 20th century as several domestic banks joined
the market. Figure 2.2 shows the amounts of domestic, foreign and public bank capital over
the period.35

2.3 Bank credit and reserve management in Uruguay under the Gold standard
Under Hume’s price-specie-flow model of the gold standard, changes in gold reserves act on
prices in such a way as to return external balance to the economy after balance of payments
shocks. For example, a fall in exports, which causes a balance of payments deficit would lead
to a gold outflow, decreasing the money supply and thereby lowering the domestic price level.
Falling prices would then move the balance of payments back into equilibrium as domestic
goods became cheaper vis-a-vis imports. The same is true for models that include banks and
paper notes backed by reserves. Banks would have adjusted money creation and credit in the
same direction as changes in their reserves in order to ensure sufficient gold backing for their
35 Bank-by-bank capital figures from 1857 to 1913 are presented in Appendix A, section A.1.

notes, and external balance would be achieved through the impact of the changing money
supply on prices (Eichengreen, 2008: 24-25). In the case of a gold inflow, the opposite would
occur; the money supply would expand, pushing up domestic prices, shifting spending to
imported goods and returning the balance of payments to equilibrium.
Where central banks existed, the gold standard would require them to play by the same “rules
of the game”, meaning they had to adjust the money supply in the same direction as gold flows,
thus guaranteeing paper currency was always backed by sufficient gold. They could do this by
changing interest rates or in other ways adjusting the quantity of credit (Ford, 1989: 208-09).
In fact, through these measures, a central bank could accelerate the adjustment process,
inducing rapid price changes, meaning that little gold had to be shipped across borders in order
for equilibrium to be achieved (Eichengreen, 2008: 27).
However, as argued by Nurske (1944), and later by Bloomfield (1959), central banks in many
countries appear to have shielded their economies from the vagaries of international shocks by
expanding domestic credit when facing gold drains, and reducing holdings of domestic assets
when capital flowed in. That is, they did the opposite of what the rules of the game prescribed.
Bloomfield presented evidence for 11 countries during the classical Gold standard period,
showing that, overall, central bank domestic and international assets (that is, credit and
reserves) moved in opposite directions in 60 percent of years between 1880 and 1913.
Bloomfield (1959: 50) admitted that, from this evidence, it could not be inferred that this was
necessarily by design, but concluded that “the results are so striking as to cast some measure
of legitimate doubt upon the common view that central bank action under the pre-1914 gold
standard had the effect of tending to reinforce the effects of gold flows on the domestic credit
base”.
Scholarship over the last several decades has confirmed Bloomfield’s intuition, showing that
countries with central banks rarely played by these “rules of the game”. Numerous country
case studies confirm this result. Bazot et al. (2022) show for a sample of 20 countries with
central banks, both core and peripheral countries consistently cushioned their domestic money
supply from international shocks. These central banks used a variety of strategies, sterilizing
gold inflows that may otherwise have adversely affected prices and ensuring credit availability
for agriculture, industry and commerce, even during episodes of gold outflows. In practice,
they balanced the objective of maintaining exchange rate stability with smoothing economic
fluctuations (Bloomfield, 1959; Eichengreen, 2008).


34
According to Ford (1989: 209), in countries with no central bank, commercial banks “had less
discretion than central banks and, indeed, were more wholehearted followers of the rules of the
game, as popularly interpreted”. Indeed, faced with a gold drain, they “could react in similar
ways [to central banks following the rules of the game] by raising their lending and borrowing
interest rates, by increasing their desired cash-deposit ratios, and by reducing their willingness
to lend.” Eichengreen (2008: 38) also takes for granted that countries without central banks
would follow the rules of the game: “Banking systems at the periphery were fragile and
vulnerable to disturbances that could bring a country’s foreign as well as domestic financial
arrangements crashing down, all the more so in the absence of a lender of last resort. A loss of
gold and foreign-exchange reserves led to a matching decline in the money supply, since there
was no central bank to sterilize the outflow or even a bond or discount market on which to
conduct sterilization operations.” Neither author explains how commercial banks react during
times of gold inflows, but it can be assumed that competition between banks would naturally
lead them to increase credit and note issues when metallic reserves entered their vaults, since
failure to do so would imply a loss of market share and profits.
This was undoubtedly true for some countries with no central bank. Bazot et al. (2022: 23-26)
show that, between 1891 and 1913, the US money supply was less shielded from international
shocks than gold standard countries with central banks. However, the US banking system was
highly regulated, with note emissions on the part of commercial banks required to be strictly
backed by government bonds. A reserve fund for deposits was also required by law
(Timberlake, 1993). The Treasury also emitted notes, but with a strict cap, limiting the scope
for monetary policy (Ugolini, 2017: 197-98).
In Uruguay, note issue was capped at three times capital, but other than that, banks faced
virtually no regulation of their balance sheets. Balance sheet management was limited only by
the need to preserve convertibility of notes and by the profit motive. The main claim of this
section is to show that in Uruguay some banks consistently broke the rules of the game, and
managed their balance sheets in a countercyclical manner.
Table 2.1 reproduces Bloomfield’s approach, but for several banks operating in Uruguay
between 1885 and 1913. It shows, in the last column, the percentage of years for which metallic
reserves and credit moved in opposite directions. For most banks, this figure is significantly
less than 50%, meaning that in most years these banks adjusted credit in a way consistent with
the rules of the game. There are two banks (the Banco Nacional and the English Bank of the


35
River Plate) for which the figure is exactly 50%. However, these banks were in operation for
only a short period of time, and there is data for only four year-to-year changes for both of
them, making it difficult to detect any particular pattern. However, for two banks -the
Comercial and the LRP- international and domestic assets moved in opposite directions in 61%
of years.

The annual data present some limitations. First, there are few data points. Second, there were
intra-annual fluctuations in these variables that are not captured by the annual data. Bi-annual
balance sheet data are available for three of these banks: the Comercial, the LRP and the Banco
Italiano, beginning in the late 1880s. Figure 2.3 shows the bi-annual data on metallic reserves
and credit for these three banks from 1888 to 1913.36 The countercyclical nature of the series
can be clearly seen for the Comercial and the LRP. Semesters where reserves rise generally
coincide with falls in credit, and vice versa.37 If they were following the rules of the game,
credit should generally move in the same direction as reserves, as was the case for the Italiano,
where reserves and credit appear to change in the same direction in most years. The correlation
coefficients of the two series are as follows: -0.30 for the Comercial, -0.14 for the LRP and
0.67 for the Italiano.
36 For the Banco Comercial, bi annual data on reserves is available from 1865, while credit data is available beginning in the second semester of 1889. The data are for March and September. For the LRP, bi annual data on reserves and credit are available beginning in the first semester of 1894, while for the Italiano, data for these variables are available beginning in the first semester of 1888. For these last two banks, the data are for June and December. 37 The rapid reaction of credit to changes in reserves can be explained by the nature of the loans made by these banks. Most of the portfolio of these banks was composed of discounted bills, the maturity of which was generally three months (Comercial, 1957; Joslin, 1963).


36
Figure 2.3: Metallic reserves and credit for the Comercial, LRP and Italiano, semester data, 1888-1907

Table 2.2 summarizes this data, for each bank from the year data is first available up to 1913,
showing the percentage of semesters where the level of credit moved in the opposite direction
of the level of metallic reserves. In addition, three sub-periods are shown for each bank: from
the initial year up to 1896 (year of the founding of the BROU), from 1897 up to 1907 (the year
the BROU became the sole note emitter), and from 1908 to 1913.
This limited evidence shows two very different behaviors. The Comercial and LRP appear to
systematically break the rules of the game by moving credit in the opposite direction to gold
reserves. The percentage of semesters in which reserves and credit moved in opposite
directions was high, around 80% for the first bank and 70% for the second. For both banks, the
percentage of semesters in which the two variables moved in opposite directions is higher in
earlier years. For example, for the Comercial, before 1896, reserves and credit moved in
opposite directions in 86.7% of semesters. From the founding of the BROU to 1907, these

variables moved in opposite directions in 86.4% of semesters. After the BROU gained a
monopoly on note emissions, this figure dropped to 58.3%. A similar pattern can be seen for
the LRP. In other words, the countercyclical behavior on the part of private banks was more
prevalent in the years before Uruguay acquired an institution resembling an actual central bank.
The Banco Italiano, on the other hand, behaved more in line with the rules of the game:
domestic and foreign assets moved in the opposite directions in only 35% of semesters.

If the Comercial and the LRP systematically broke the “rules of the game” in terms of credit
and reserve management, it should be reflected in the liabilities side of their balance sheets as
lower volatility of note issue and deposits. Table 2.3 shows the coefficient of variation of
liabilities, that is bills in circulation plus deposits, for several Uruguayan banks from 1885 to
1913. For most of this period, the only banks to circulate banknotes were the LRP, the Italiano
and the BROU (other banks circulated notes only for a few years before 1892). The Comercial
and the LRP have the lowest coefficient of variation of liabilities (0.39 and 0.20, respectively).
For the other banks, the level of this indicator is between 0.40 and 0.75.

The annual data on liabilities suffers from the same problem as the information on reserves and
credit; there are few data points and there were intra-annual fluctuations that are not captured
by the annual data. Fortunately, we also have bi annual data for the Comercial, the LRP and
the Banco Italiano for notes in circulation and total liabilities. We can examine this data in
comparison to reserves data we used in our earlier analysis. To start with, for the Banco
Comercial, there is bi annual data on metallic reserves and notes in circulation (but not for
deposits) from 1865 to 1888 (shown in figure 2.4).38

It appears note circulation for this bank did not adjust in direct relation to changes in reserves.
Reserves fluctuated greatly, in some semesters by over 50%, while notes in circulation
remained remarkably stable. For example, the return of prosperity after the 1869 crisis led the
bank to increase note circulation beginning in the second half of 1871, while reserves did not
38 Although the country was permanently on the gold standard beginning only in 1876, the date of first adoption was 1865, and the Comercial (along with the LRP) resisted all attempts to deviate from strict convertibility from at least this date, including rejecting adherence to various suspensions of banknote convertibility decreed during these years (Acevedo, 1933b). Thus, it is instructive to examine this bank's behavior from before 1876.

begin to rise until the following year. Both reserves and note circulation fell in 1873, coinciding
with a bank run due to the collapse of a small competitor, the Banco Oriental, that year. The
reserves of the Banco Comercial experienced increasingly wild swings from the mid 1870s
onwards, while note circulation remained stable through the 1875 crisis and subsequent
depression. Notes began rising in 1880, when prosperity returned to the country, trending
upwards until the bank gave up its right to currency emission in 1887, but always remained
much more stable than the erratic movements seen in reserves.
For 1888 to 1907, there is information on all three banks.39 In general, for the three banks,
notes in circulation and total liabilities tended to move in the same direction as reserves,
although much less so for the Comerical and the LRP than for the Italiano. For example, from
the late 1880s to 1913, the percentage of semesters for which reserves and total liabilities
moved in different directions were 43%, 43% and 14% for each bank, respectively. In addition,
although these variables tended to move in the same direction in most semesters, fluctuations
in banknote circulation and total liabilities were smaller than changes in reserves for the
Comercial and the LRP (Figure 2.5).

Table 2.4 summarizes the bi annual data by presenting the coefficient of variation for metallic
reserves, note circulation and liabilities for the three banks, from 1865 to the first half of 1907
(the free banking period), depending on when data is available. The coefficient for note
circulation is only for the years in which the banks engaged in this activity, and is compared to
coefficients of reserves over the same time periods.

The coefficients of variation for notes in circulation and liabilities for the LRP and the
Comercial were substantially lower than those for reserves. It appears that not only did the note
emissions of these banks change less than would have been warranted by a strict rules-of-the
game approach, but deposits also adjusted to a lesser degree. The same cannot be said for the
Banco Italiano, which has a coefficient of variation for note circulation (1888-1907) only
slightly lower than that for metallic reserves, while the coefficients of variation for liabilities
are far higher for both the 1888-1907 and 1888-1913 periods. In addition, the fluctuations in
the note circulation and liabilities of the Comercial and LRP were much lower than the
fluctuations of those of the Banco Italiano.
In addition to the bi annual data, monthly data on reserves and notes in circulation is available
for the Banco Comercial and the LRP from May, 1879, to April, 1881 (Figure 2.6), and shows
the same pattern observed with the bi annual data. Reserves vary much more than notes in
circulation. For the first bank, the coefficients of variation are 0.25 for reserves and 0.10 for
notes, while for the second they are 0.33 and 0.16, respectively.

The evidence presented in these sections suggests that the Banco Comercial and the LRP did
not manage assets and liabilities in a way consistent with the “rules of the game”. Changes in
domestic assets moved in the opposite direction of changes in international assets more often
than not. Furthermore, liabilities remained rather stable with respect to the variations in
metallic reserves, as well as with respect to the liabilities of other banks. These banks appear
to have acted in a way which neutralized movements in their metallic reserves and smoothed
fluctuations in their note circulation and deposits.
2.4 Economy-wide effects of countercyclical balance sheet management40
With well-integrated capital markets, for a country with banks playing by the rules of the game,
shocks in world interest rates should be incorporated into domestic rates to a large degree.
However, if central banks were trying to smooth volatility by managing balance sheets
countercyclically, domestic rates would have a low correlation with world rates. Bazot et al.
(2022) show that for countries on the gold standard and with central banks, domestic interest
rates were in fact highly independent from world rates, as proxied by the Bank of England
(BoE) discount rate. They use panel data for 22 countries, 21 of which had central banks, and
show that the interest rate “pass through” was on average around 20% (i.e., after a rise of 100
basis points in the BoE rate, the domestic rate rose an average of 20 basis points). It was slightly
higher in core countries (24%), which relied more heavily on countercyclical balance sheet
management, than for peripheral countries (17%), which in addition used restrictions on capital
flows in order to protect central bank gold reserves. However, for the US, the only country in
their sample that did not have a central bank, the pass-through rate was much higher: 49%.

Here, we examine the pass through of shocks in the BoE rate for the Uruguayan economy,
using a VAR model and impulse response analysis. Other variables have been included in order
to capture the main dynamics of interest rate adjustments. Because of free capital movements
and almost instantaneous information flows, external shocks caused rapid domestic reactions,
and monthly data has been used in order to capture adjustments that could occur and dissipate
well within a year’s time. This, of course, limits the variables that can be used, since monthly
data for this period is scarce. Monthly data on the BoE rate is available from Jorda et al. (2017),
while for the Uruguayan discount rate (uru) it is available from the Boletin de la Bolsa de
Comercio de Montevideo and the Uruguayan financial press.41 Figure 2.7 shows the monthly
Uruguayan market discount rate and the Bank of England discount rate from November of
1876 to December of 1913.

41 The Boletin de la Bolsa de Comercio de Montevideo is available monthly from April 1884 to August 1894 and from October 1899 to December 1913. For the rest of the period, data was drawn from the following newspapers: El Siglo, La Democracia, La Idea, La Nación, El Bién Público, El Hilo Eléctrico, La Tarde and Montevideo Noticioso. Figures are from the last day of the month, unless no figure was published this day (or it was unreadable), in which case the figure for the preceding day was used. The financial press quotes the figures published by the stock exchange (Bolsa de Comercio), so the underlying source for both is the same. 42 The three-month bill rate tells us how many pesos one had to pay on the spot in order to receive one pound in London in three months’ time. It therefore contains the British interest rate, which must be stripped out in order to convert it to a pure spot rate. The spot exchange rate is given in pesos per pound sterling and was calculated the following way: S=E1+OM/400 Where S is the spot exchange rate, E is the exchange rate on three-month bills and OM is the London open market discount rate in percentage points. OM is an annual rate, and is therefore divided by four to convert it to a threemonth rate.

real economy and on the money supply. There are no monthly estimates of GDP for Uruguay.
Bazot et al. (2016), in a similar exercise for France, use monthly imports as a proxy for
aggregate demand, despite the fact that this variable would also be affected by foreign supply.
While for Uruguay the customs house did not report import values at monthly intervals, it did
report monthly receipts from import duties, which were the main source of government
revenues. This data, of course, is even noisier than direct information on imports, due to the
fact that receipts could vary not only according to the volume of imports, but also to their
composition, which could change over time, even over the course of a year due to seasonal
variations, since different products carried different tariff rates.43 A further complication is that
tariff rates, and the official values -valores de aforo- upon which they were calculated, changed
periodically. Despite this, the import tariff receipt data can give an indication of overall demand
from an economy heavily dependent on imports. The log of this variable is used here
(ln_imp_tar). There are no monthly series for the Uruguayan money supply either. Monthly
data on gold exports and imports is available. In general, this type of data on gold flows from
customs house records is considered somewhat unreliable.44 For example, Bazot, et al. (2016:
91) suggest that for France, the omission of flows was important, especially due to undeclared
coins brought by travelers in their personal belongings. However, they use this data in spite of
its unreliability, suggesting “trade statistics may provide interesting information to estimate the
response of gold flows to a change in foreign discount rates”. Thus, net gold inflows have been
used here (gold_total).
Data on the BoE rate, the Uruguayan discount rate and the exchange rate are available for
basically the entirety of the gold standard period in Uruguay: from November of 1876 to
December of 1913. For import receipts, data is available from January 1880 to December 1913.
For net gold flows, figures are available from January of 1883 to December of 1907. The VAR
model has applied for the whole period, as well as for several sub periods, and for different
specifications and lags. We obtain impulse response functions with their 68% confidence
intervals, using the Kilian’s bootstrap technique. To identify the shocks, we adopt the standard
Cholesky scheme with the following ordering: boe, uru, ex, ln_imp_tar, gold_total. Placing the
BoE rate first in the ordering implies that it is affected by the other variables describing the
43 These could vary from around 5% for some investment goods, like wire fencing, to 57% for consumption goods like cigarettes (Bertino and Millot, 1996: 375-376). 44 In regard to the Uruguayan statistics, Acevedo (1934a: 41) states that the data on monetary specie was “deficient, due to a lack of efficient auditing of the declarations made by the commanders of ships”.


44
Uruguayan economy only after a month (but not contemporaneously).45 The pass-through rate
is determined by calculating the response of the Uruguayan discount rate to a one standard
deviation shock to the structural error of the BoE rate.46
For all sub periods, the Schwarz criterion indicates either one or two lags. For any particular
period and specification, the one-lag model always reports lower pass-through rates than the
two-lag model. As a robustness check, rates for both one and two lags are compared across
different sub periods and specifications.
For the whole gold standard period (1876-1913), only a three-variable model can be estimated
(boe, uru, ex). The pass-through rate for the recommended 2-lag specification is 42%, while
for the four-variable model (over the period 1880-1913), the rate is 46%.47 Both figures are
close to the rate which Bazot et al (2022) find for the US (49%). However, the results vary
significantly if we divide the gold standard period in two parts: the free banking period, up to
August of 1907, on one hand, and the period after the BROU gained a monopoly on currency
issue, on the other. Table 2.5 shows the pass-through rates for the two sub periods under
different specifications (the maximum value of the impulse response is reported). For each
model, the lags suggested by the Schwartz criterion are in grey. For the period where the BROU
was the sole paper currency issuer, the pass-through rates are much higher. For the
recommended one-lag model, rates range from 40% to 44%, while for two lags, they range
from 46% to 51%. In contrast, for the free banking period, for the three and four variable
models, the rates are 39% and 38% respectively (using two lags). If one lag is used, the rates
are around 26%. For the same period, the five-variable model, one lag is recommended, and
the pass-through rate is 24% (32% for two lags).
45 Since only a shock to the BoE rate is modelled, the order of the other variables is not important. 46 The rise in the impulse response function of the Uruguayan rate is taken as a percentage of the standard deviation of the residual of the BoE rate. 47 For one lag, the rates are 29% and 30%, respectively.

After 1907, the BROU’s monopoly on paper currency emission and its accumulation of specie
reserves (almost 50% of banking sector reserves by 1907, and almost 70% by 1911) put it in a
position where it could have attempted volatility smoothing through countercyclical balance
sheet management, but we do not know if it actually did. The annual data presented in figure
2 showed specie reserves and credit moving in opposite directions in only 41% of years,
although, as mentioned earlier, annual data may hide intra-annual correlations. However,
regardless of whether the BROU was attempting to smooth volatility or not, the response of
the local discount rate to shocks in the BoE rate was high, around the same level that Bazot et
al. (2022: 32) find for the US. In the free banking period, the reaction of the local discount rate
was much lower. For the most complete model, with five variables, the pass-through rate was
equivalent to what Bazot et all (2022: 22) find for gold standard core countries which practiced
volatility smoothing.
Figures 2.8 and 2.9 show, for each period, respectively, the response of the Uruguayan
economic variables in the two-lag models to a one standard deviation shock in the BoE rate.48
48 Although the Schwarz criterion recommends the one-lag model for the most relevant specifications in both periods, Bazot et al (2016) and Bazot et al (2022) present results for two lags, and thus it can be instructive to examine the responses of the endogenous variables for the two-lag model in the Uruguayan case, but also because it makes for a more direct comparison to the results reported by those papers for other countries. The main results do not differ much for the one model. For the free banking period, exchange rate rises (currency depreciation) immediately by 0.0024, which is about 0.05% of its par value, but quickly returns to normal levels. The initial negative reaction in the aggregate demand proxy is not statistically significant, which is consistent with successful volatility smoothing, and is slightly positive after six months. One strange result is the reaction of gold inflows, which rise in the first month after the shock, although the effect quickly dissipates. For the BROU-as-sole-currency-issuer period, the exchange rate rises by 0.14% of par value, almost three times as much as in the first period, although the effect quickly dissipates. This is the opposite of what would be expected under the hypothesis suggested here. If there was no volatility smoothing in this period, or less than in the free banking period, the reaction of the exchange rate should be less than in the earlier period, since the higher increase in the discount rate would keep the exchange rate in check. Import tariff revenue falls in the month of the shock, consistent with a lack of sterilization, since higher interest rates would dampen aggregate demand, although the effect quickly dissipates.


46
For the free banking period, this implies a rise in the BoE rate of 0.42 percentage points. In this
case, the Uruguayan discount rate rises by 0.14 percentage points, meaning the pass-through
rate is 32%, somewhat higher than the levels reported by Bazot et al (2022) for volatility
smoothing countries, but far below the level reported for the US. The maximum is reached
after two months and the effect quickly dissipates, reaching non statistically significant levels
five months after the original shock. The response of the exchange rate is slightly higher than
in the one-lag model, rising around 0.08% of par. The immediate reaction of the aggregate
demand proxy is not statistically significant until four months after the external shock, after
which it becomes positive. Gold inflows rise in the first month after the shock, by about 64,000
pounds, although the effect quickly dissipates. This is a non-trivial amount, since average net
gold inflows in the period were 80,000 pounds per year.

For the BROU-as-sole-currency-issuer period, the four-variable model with two lags, a one
standard deviation shock in the BoE rate implies a rise of 0.44 percentage points. The local rate
rises by 0.2 percentage points, implying an interest rate pass-through of 46%, which reaches
its peak at four months after the initial shock. The response of the exchange rate is similar to
the free banking period, rising about 0.08% of the par rate. The aggregate demand proxy
responds much in the same way as in the one-lag model, showing a slightly statistically
significant negative effect in the first month after the shock. This would be consistent with a
lack of volatility smoothing, because the rise in the local discount rate dampens economic
activity.
Bazot et al. (2022) present their results for three categories of gold standard countries: core,
peripheral (both of which have central banks) and the US, which had a free banking system
with no central bank. These can be seen in Figure 2.10. As mentioned earlier, they find that
pass-through rates in core countries were slightly higher (24% on average) than those for
peripheral countries (17% on average). This is because in peripheral countries the discount rate
was less effective a tool for influencing short-term capital flows, due to weaker financial
integration and less credibility than in core countries. Thus, peripheral countries relied more
heavily on partial inconvertibility, sometimes called “gold devices”, in order to widen the gold
points and allow for greater fluctuations in the exchange rate without provoking gold exports.
This is reflected in the reaction of exchange rates in the right-hand graphs in figure 16. For core
countries, the exchange rate reacts swiftly, rising by about 0.08%, but the effect dissipates by
the second month after the shock. For peripheral countries the exchange rate rises by almost
double, around 0.014%, and the effect lasts much longer. For the free banking US, the market


48
discount rate rises much more than in countries with central banks, the pass-through rate being
49%. There is an immediate rise in of exchange rate, but it swiftly returns to its normal range.
This is because the burden of adjustment is carried by the interest rate.

The point of this section has been to show that the results for Uruguay’s free banking period
are more in line with countries that had volatility smoothing central banks than with the free
banking US.49 It is also interesting to note that the response of the Uruguayan discount rate and
exchange rate look more similar to the results for core countries than for peripheral countries.
49 An alternative explanation for the insensitivity of Uruguayan domestic interest rates to shocks in the international rate is that banks could have been credit rationing. In some early banking systems, directors used bank resources to fund their own or their family members’ business activities, neglecting other clients. In this sense, interest rates would not have responded to normal supply and demand conditions, and would show up as having a low pass-through rate in the econometric analysis. For an example and discussion of this phenomenon, see Lamoreaux (1996). This topic merits further investigation for the case of Uruguay, and is part of my agenda for future research.


49
Not only is the pass-through rate in Uruguay closer to that for core countries, the reaction of
the exchange rate is also swift, of similar size, and short lived.
Part of the reason may lie in the use of gold devices, that is, partial inconvertibility, by most
countries in the Bazot et al. (2022) sample, but the authors find a greater reliance on the part
of peripheral countries than core countries. These were strategies implemented by central banks
that temporarily raised the cost or otherwise impeded the export or import of gold. Common
practices involved raising the price at which they sold (bought) gold bars or foreign coins,
which essentially raised the gold export point (lowered the gold import point), sometimes
known as “gold devices”. They could also encourage the redemption of notes in lightweight
gold coin or in silver (by placing a premium on gold withdrawals), which had the effect of
allowing exchanges to go past the gold export point without provoking gold outflows.
Redemption of notes could be restricted geographically to the main office in the capital, raising
the cost of converting notes to gold. Some countries placed special requirements on commercial
banks that wanted to redeem notes at times of balance of payments stress, or used informal
pressure to discourage withdrawals of gold (Bloomfield, 1959: 52-54).
It is likely that these strategies were not available to the Comercial and LRP in Uruguay. The
law prevented them from placing impediments on gold withdrawals or a premium on gold.
These two banks did not have branches outside Montevideo until the 20th century,50 and could
therefore not have temporarily placed geographical restrictions on withdrawals. It is also
doubtful that they could have influenced other banks from redeeming withdrawing gold. In
Uruguay, discount rates were also likely not as effective a tool as in core countries, but gold
devices were not an available option either. This could explain the rapid adjustment of the
exchange rate, since there was no way for banks to temporarily widen the gold points.
In the case of Uruguay, the rise in gold inflows in the free banking period presents a mystery.
If banks were actively smoothing external volatility by keeping the domestic interest rate from
rising when the BoE rate rose, it means they would have had to allow gold to flow out of their
coffers, and out of the country. They would have offset this by increasing domestic credit,
thereby cushioning the impact of the external shock. It is not clear what could explain a gold
50 The LRP opened its second branch in Salto in 1905 and a third in Rivera a few years later, as well as several agencies in Montevideo (Joslin, 1963: 138), while the Comercial did not have any secondary agencies in Montevideo until 1937 and any branches outside Montevideo until 1940 (Comercial, 1957)

inflow contemporaneous with a rise in the BoE rate. In any case, the effect is short lived,
becoming non-statistically significant in the month after the shock.
2.5 The reputation and size of the Banco Comercial and the LRP
Breaking the rules of the game would create two problems for a commercial bank. The first,
endangering convertibility, was a problem faced also by central banks in other countries. The
solution was generally to work within the gold points and rely on reputation to ensure reserve
ratios never dipped too low. The second was a loss of market share and short-term profits.
Central banks, if not state-owned, could compensate this loss with the income generated from
note circulation and from other privileges they might have.51 However, the Banco Comercial
and the LRP had no such privileges. Why then would they consistently break the rules of the
game, when doing so could endanger convertibility, and, at least in the short term, put them at
a competitive disadvantage relative to other banks? The answer may lie in their unquestioned
commitment to the gold standard and their dominant position in the banking sector for much
of the period.
The Comercial and the LRP were two of the oldest banks in the country, founded in 1857 and
1863, respectively. The Comercial was founded by foreign merchants, mostly of British origin,
operating in Uruguay, and this group was heavily represented on the bank’s board throughout
the period. The LRP was a branch of the British bank of the same name, and also served foreign
commercial interests (Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 448-52). They were traditionally defenders of
monetary orthodoxy, resisting attempts by the government to found a state bank (Barrán and
Nahum, 1971: 470). For example, they strongly opposed the establishment of the Banco
Nacional in 1887, and from the moment it opened its doors, these two banks cleared their
holdings of the Nacional’s notes on a daily basis (Joslin, 1963: 135; Barrán and Nahum, 1971:
474).
These banks had been founded during the tumultuous 1850s and 1860s. They both served the
merchant class involved in international trade, especially the import of European goods (Barrán
and Nahum, 1971: 448-451). This group of merchants was highly committed to the gold
standard because of the nature of their business. Their costs for imports were in gold, while
their revenue was in pesos, and it behooved them to receive their income in a gold-linked
51 These could include the handling of government accounts, lending to the government and having a monopoly on certain types of transactions, for example, the sale of cédulas.


51
currency. In addition, the LRP also served many of the British companies that built and
operated the country’s transport and urban infrastructures, such as railways, tramways and
waterworks. The Central Uruguay Railway, for example, had its account with the LRP, and
received occasional large loans from the bank (Díaz, 2014: 82). Not only that, but often the
same men served on the board of directors of these banks and those of their client companies.
For example, the director of the Uruguayan branch of the LRP, George Drabble, was also
director of the Central Uruguay Railway Company (Winn, 2010: 21). These companies also
faced many costs in gold52 and received income in local currency, and thus benefitted by
adherence to the gold standard.
Their commitment to the gold standard was unquestioned, and, despite their countercyclical
balance sheet management, they never allowed reserve ratios to fall dangerously low. As can
be seen in Table 2.6, the Comercial and the LRP had the highest ratios of reserves to notes in
circulation of any bank, maintaining reserves of over 150% of notes. These ratios never fell
below 100% in any one year. Other banks generally also maintained reserve ratios of at least
100%, with the exception of the Banco Nacional. The ratio of reserves to liabilities were also
high for the Comercial and LRP, at the higher end of banks in the sector, around 50%. This
figure occasionally fell to as low as 20% for these two banks, although it quickly recovered.

For example, the LRP and the Comercial raised their reserve ratios during the boom years at
the end of the 1880s. For the LRP, reserves went from 170% of notes in 1888 to 235% in 1890.
In relation to liabilities, reserves rose from 40% to 55% for the LRP, while for the Comercial
52 In Uruguay, railway companies imported much of the materials for building and operating the line: rails, locomotives, wagons, metallic structures for bridges and even the sleepers upon which the rails were laid. Coal was also a major imported input (Díaz, 2014).


52
they went from 21% to 89% in the same years. This was at a time when ratios for most other
banks fell, or rose only slightly. For example, reserves to notes for the Banco Italiano were
109%, 88% and 136% for 1888, 1889 and 1890, while reserves to liabilities were 48%, 42%
and 41%. For the Banco Nacional, the reserves to notes were 74%, 48% and 7%, while reserves
to liabilities were 25%, 14% and 1%.53 The reason for rising reserve ratios on the part of the
Comercial and LRP is clear. They were protecting themselves and their clients from the coming
crisis. Joslin (1963: 135) notes that the LRP’s branch director, Robert Thurburn,
“began to reduce his loans in gold and to strengthen the bank’s gold reserve, as in a crisis the
branch would be subject to a dual strain. Merchants would be withdrawing gold for export, and
notes would be cashed in a domestic banking panic. The London Bank’s position resembled
that of the Bank of England in the first half of the nineteenth century rather than that of an
ordinary commercial concern. Long before the crash came Thurburn told Head Office that he
was ‘well prepared’”.
The Comercial, in 1887, went so far as to renounce its right to emit banknotes, for the same
reason. It saw what the founding of the Banco Nacional would bring, and preferred to sacrifice
the profitability of banknote emission rather than be exposed to an inevitable run once the crisis
hit (Banco Comercial, 1957).
The Comercial and the LRP were the only two banks to survive the crisis of 1876, and from
this year, until the end of the century, they dominated the banking sector. Figure 2.11 shows
the percent of total metallic reserves, notes in circulation, liabilities and credit in the hands of
these two banks. In the late 1870s and early 1880s, these two banks held over 90% of the
metallic reserves, liabilities and credit of the banking sector, and 100% of the currency in
circulation. The market share of these banks dropped precipitously through the boom years of
the late 1880s, as several banks joined the market, but recovered after the crisis, when several
large banks went bust. In 1895, before the founding of the Banco de la República, when there
were already 11 banks operating in the country, these two banks held over 50% of reserves,
liabilities and assets of the sector and around 80% of notes in circulation. These proportions
fell gradually over the rest of the period, reaching about 20% by 1913, while their note
circulation disappeared after the LRP lost its right to emit paper currency in 1904.

The reputation of the Comercial and the LRP as stalwart defenders of the gold standard and
their dominant position in the banking sector likely gave these banks some leeway in regard to
balance sheet management. They maintained high reserve ratios on average, although they
could allow reserve ratios to fall on occasion, because the public knew that they were
committed to note convertibility. They also had close extra-commercial ties with their client
base; the men directing both banks also ran several of the companies that they did business
with. This, coupled with their dominant position in the market, meant that they did not have to
behave in a single-mindedly competitive way. When gold flowed into their vaults, they did not
feel compelled to expand credit, seeking short-term profits. Rather, they could hold off,
allowing reserves to accumulate, putting them in a better position for when economic
conditions reversed.
2.6 Conclusions
This paper presents evidence on the operation of the gold standard in Uruguay from its adoption
in the 1870s up to 1913. The results are suggestive in light of Uruguay’s performance in
adhering a fixed exchange rate for almost 40 years without a central bank. Under its free
banking system, two banks, - the Comercial and the LRP-, appear to have consistently broken
the rules of the game by expanding domestic assets in the face of reserve losses, as well as
sterilizing gold inflows. Furthermore, currency in circulation and total liabilities of these two

banks appear to have fluctuated far less than did metallic reserves, and less than those of other
banks. This indicates that they acted to smooth volatility in gold reserves and shield their clients
from changes in gold reserves.
Could this action, intended to shield their clients from volatility in gold movements, have
helped ease the burdens imposed by the gold standard on the economy as a whole, in a way
similar to what occurred in countries with central banks? In addition to the micro level evidence
regarding the Comercial and the LRP, a macro level analysis of the reaction of the domestic
interest rate to shocks in world interest rates suggests that these banks’ efforts at volatility
smoothing may have had economy-wide impacts. The local interest rate was relatively
insensitive to shocks in the BoE rate, with interest rate pass through being quite low during the
free banking period before 1907. That is, shocks in international interest rates were not fully
absorbed into domestic rates.
The Comercial and the LRP, the oldest banks in operation in the country, were stalwart
defenders of the gold standard and were the dominant banks in the sector before 1900. This
may have put them in a position where they had some leeway in terms of balance sheet
management, allowing them to provide liquidity to their clients even when gold reserves fell.
They did this by accumulating reserves in good times, even though it meant sacrificing short
term profits.

Chapter 3: Capital flows, sudden stops and balance of payments adjustments under a fixed exchange rate: Uruguay, 1870-1913
3.1 Introduction
The balance of payments can represent a fundamental constraint for developing countries
(Thirlwall, 2004). Specialization in primary products requires imports of specific goods,
especially capital goods, in order to grow and low savings rates makes developing countries
dependent on foreign capital to raise investment rates and to provide foreign exchange for
imports. Furthermore, foreign reserves are an integral part of managing the value of local
currency, especially under fixed exchange rate regimes. In this way, foreign investment, the
balance of payments and the domestic money supply are intimately tied.
This was the rule under the classical gold standard in the late 19th century and early 20th century.
International capital flows were a fundamental feature of this period, when newly formed
nation states, which lacked local capital and sufficiently developed financial markets, needed
foreign investment in order to develop internal resources. Without railways, ports and land
improvements, natural resources could not be exploited and exported to European markets.
Large waves of capital flowed from core countries to the periphery, much of it directed towards
infrastructure investments, promoting economic development in many of the receiving
countries and raising growth rates.
For capital exporting countries on the gold standard, outward investment could have an
equilibrating effect on the balance of payments, as it created demand for their exports of capital
goods and manufactures. For capital importing countries, foreign investment provided an
opportunity, but could have unexpected outcomes which were not always positive. Long-term
investments could fail to generate the expected returns, weighing the economy down with debt
service which could not be met through export growth. To make matters worse, financial and
political instability could scare investors, which could withdraw funding, leaving the country
unable to maintain import levels necessary for growth. In addition, the intimate link between


56
the balance of payments and the domestic money supply under the gold standard made capital
inflows a particularly important source of volatility.
Sharp turnarounds in capital flows, sometimes called ‘sudden stops’ were a permanent feature
of the first wave of globalization (Catão, 2007). These were often associated with major current
account balance adjustments, financial crises and sovereign debt defaults, and could have
severe negative effects on output growth (Edwards, 2004). There is also a strong link between
sudden stops and currency depreciations (Catão, 2007: 258-264). Thus, sudden stops are
particularly relevant to the international monetary regime that drew in much of the trading
world during the first globalization.
Uruguay appears to be one of the success stories of engagement with the world economy during
the first globalization. The country ranks well among a group of Latin American economies
that grew rapidly in the decades leading up to 1914, based in large part on the exploitation and
export of natural resources to international markets.54 It also received large amounts of foreign
capital; among independent Latin American countries, by 1913 only Argentina, Brazil, Chile
and Mexico had received more foreign investment than Uruguay, in absolute terms. In this
year, the value of total foreign investment per capita placed Uruguay in 4th position, after
Argentina, Peru and Chile (Fishlow, 1985: 394). However, this made the country vulnerable to
the vicissitudes of international capital markets, suffering several episodes of downturns in
capital inflows, two of which can be considered sudden stops.
Another aspect of Uruguay’s history that makes it stand out among its neighbors is its
adherence to the gold standard. As mentioned in chapter 2, the gold standard was made law in
Uruguay in 1865, although the country struggled to maintain convertibility in the first years.
However, after a convertibility suspension in 1875, it suspended convertibility of paper
currency only once, in 1890. These two suspensions were years associated with sudden stops
in capital flows and economic crises. However, in both cases the suspension of specie payments
was short lived, with a return to the gold backing at the same earlier parity. This meant that the
adjustments to sudden stops did not occur through currency depreciation, and makes Uruguay
an interesting case study, since it was particularly exposed to external volatility through its
54 With less than 2% of the region’s population (Bértola and Ocampo 2010: 95) and less than 1% of its surface area, it was the seventh largest economy in Latin America in 1913. GDP grew at an average annual rate of 3.9% from 1870 to 1913, second only to Argentina’s 5.8%, and higher than the average rate for the region of 3.5% (Bertola and Ocampo, 2012: 100) Uruguay was Latin America’s sixth largest exporter by value throughout the period, and in the top four in terms of export value per capita (Bértola and Ocampo, 2012: 86).


57
commercial openness and dependence on foreign investment. If it did not resort to devaluation,
a crucial tool for avoiding the full brunt of a sudden stop, how was the fall in capital flows
accommodated? In particular, how did the balance of payments adjust and what was the effect
on the money supply?
In order to explore these questions, this chapter offers a reconstruction of the balance of
payments and the balance sheet of the banking sector in Uruguay from 1870 to 1913. For the
capital account, new series for foreign investment are constructed, which go beyond the usual
sources used for this time period (many studies rely exclusively on Stone’s (1999) database on
British capital exports). A larger set of international sources are used, as well as local sources.
In regard to the current account, corrected series for merchandise trade are used, and new series
for the services and unilateral transfers balances are developed. Data on gold flows from 1878
to 1907 is also presented for the reserve account. The balance sheet of the banking sector 
capital, reserves, notes in circulation, deposits and credit- is reconstructed based on information
from individual banks that operated over the period.
This information, along with the monetary aggregates mentioned in chapter 2 and discussed in
appendix A, is used to explore how the economy adjusted to three episodes of downturns in
foreign investment, two of which were sudden stops. Section 3.2 presents the reconstruction of
foreign investment flows, the current account and gold movements in the decades before 1914.
Section 3.3 defines two sudden stop episodes and compares them to a third episode of a fall in
investment flows that was not a sudden stop. It discusses the balance of payments adjustment
process in each case. In section 3.4, information on the banking sector and the money supply
data is used to discuss the adjustment process and the consequences of sudden stops for
Uruguay during the period. Section 3.5 offers concludes.
3.2 Uruguay’s balance of payments
This section presents a reconstruction of Uruguay’s balance of payments from 1870 to 1913.
It is important to highlight that for the first globalization period, this type of information is
scarce for countries outside Europe.55 Data on merchandise trade is easy to come by, since it
55 As far as I know, for the Americas, pre-1914 balance of payments figures, which include direct estimates of capital flows and of the “invisible items”, are available only for the US (Simon, 1960), Brazil (Barroso-Franco, 1987) from 1876 to 1897, Chile (Edwards, 2000) and Argentina (Gerchunoff and Llach, 1998) starting in 1900. For Uruguay, Donnángelo and Millan (2006) offer an estimate of the balance of payments for the pre-1914 period, but uses uncorrected trade series, makes only a limited attempt to estimate the rest of the current account and the capital account, and contains some important conceptual errors.


58
was often collected and published by governments. However, the services balance, especially
items like service on foreign debt and freight costs, could weigh heavily in the current account.
For countries that received large numbers of immigrants, remittances, part of the unilateral
transfers balance, could also be important. Furthermore, estimates of capital flows for the first
globalization are often based exclusively on British foreign investment data, since Britain was
the largest capital exporter during this period.56 Some studies dispense entirely with direct
estimates of capital flows, and use indirect estimates, that is, the residual of the current and
reserve accounts.57 For indirect estimates of the capital account to be believable, a high degree
of confidence is required in the data on the other items of the balance of payments.
In this section, direct estimates of all the major items of the balance of payments are presented:
the capital account, the merchandise trade balance, the services and unilateral transfers
balances, changes in international reserves, as well as the errors and omissions series.
3.2.1 Capital account balance
Since the focus of this paper is on sudden stops in foreign investment, it made sense to start
with estimating the capital account. This account registers transactions in financial assets, that
is, sums transferred with the promise of future repayment. To date, the best estimate of
Uruguayan capital flows is Donnángelo and Millan (2006), which provides a series for the
1870 to 2003 period. This is an important effort, but relies on few, only local, sources and
contains several errors. Due to these problems, an original estimate has been constructed here.
Little data is available on investment by Uruguayan residents in overseas ventures, but it was
likely minimal during the period. Before 1914, most foreign investment on the part of
Uruguayans would have been in the agriculture and livestock sector in Argentina and Brazil.
According to the Argentine Agricultural Census of 1908, Uruguayans had invested about
635,000 pounds in agricultural establishments by that year, mostly in the provinces bordering
Uruguay (Jacob, 2004: 167-168).58 Less was likely invested in livestock, since only 40% of
Uruguayan establishments in Argentina were of this nature in 1914. By 1920 there were 1,365
56 The most thorough presentation of annual British foreign investment data is provided in Stone (1999), which relies on data from Jenks (1944) and Simon (1967; 1968; 1970). Estimates for other countries -France, Germany and the US- for some years are presented in Fishlow (1985). Esteves (2011 and 2012) present annual data on French and German foreign investment that are comparable to Stone’s estimates for Britain. 57 For example, see Prados de la Escosura (2009). 58 Jacob (2004: 167) presents a figure of 6,777,552 Argentine paper pesos. The exchange rate in that year was about 10.7 pesos per pound. One pound = 5.05 gold pesos (Acevedo, 1934: 73); one gold peso = 2.27 paper pesos (della Paolera and Taylor, 2001: 23).


59
Uruguayan run establishments operating in Brazil. However, year-to-year data is not available,
and due to the small volume compared to incoming investment flows, an estimate for this item
has not been included here.
In contrast to Uruguayan investments abroad, there is a wealth of information available on
investment in Uruguay on the part of foreigners. As mentioned above, most studies on foreign
investment during the first globalization rely almost exclusively on Stone’s (1999) database of
British overseas investment. Since Britain was the main capital exporter in this period, his
figures are adequate to get a general idea of foreign investment in a particular country.
However, they do not give the whole picture, and for a detailed analysis of sudden stops and
balance of payments adjustments, a more nuanced approach is needed. Thus, in this section,
foreign investment has been estimated using a variety of local and international sources.
Investment has been broken down into three categories: public debt, railways and other foreign
direct investment. A brief description of the sources and methods used for each category is
given here, but a full explanation is provided in Appendix A.
Annual foreign investment in public debt has been estimated from year-to-year changes in
external public debt in circulation abroad. Information has been taken primarily from official
sources, -the Anuarios Estadísticos del Uruguay (AEU) and the Memorias del Ministerio de
Hacienda-, as well as from some secondary sources. These are the works of Eduardo Acevedo
(Anales históricos del Uruguay, volumes 3 (1933), 4 (1934) and 5 (1934), and Notas y Apuntes,
volumes 1 and 2 (1903), Ferrando (1967) and Nahum (1994). In addition, Stone’s (1999)
database for British overseas investment was used to complement the information where
official accounts are thought to be unreliable. All ten known emissions of external public debt
sold during the period have been taken into account, as well as treasury notes that circulated
abroad. This debt circulated mostly on the London stock market, with some loans being floated
in Paris in the early 20th century. Three main adjustments have been made to the nominal
figures in order to estimate effective capital flows, that is the actual amount transferred across
borders. First, discounts offered on the nominal price of loans have been taken into account.
Second, bonds often moved between European and Uruguayan markets after their initial sale.
This was the case because external debt was often used to convert old internal debt,59 and
therefore ended up in the hands of Uruguayan residents. They could then sell these bonds to
59 Internal debt was denominated in pesos and sold domestically. External debt was denominated in gold and intended to be marketed abroad.


60
foreigners. The initial bond conversion does not constitute a capital inflow; the secondary sale
of the bond by a resident to a foreigner does. Finally, amortization of bonds could be made at
market value, depending on the stipulations of the contract. For bonds that permitted this type
of amortization, effective amounts amortized have been taken into account for the capital flows
series. A series for nominal amounts in circulation abroad has also been constructed in order
to calculate interest paid overseas (see section 2.2.3, on invisible items in the balance of
payments).
Railway investment was carried out almost solely by British companies during the period. Data
on the value of shares and debentures emitted by these companies overseas has been taken
directly from Company reports. Discounts and premiums, as well as share buybacks, have been
taken into account. Complete company reports are available for all of the main companies, and
for many of the smaller ones. The picture that can be obtained from these sources contemplates
almost 100% of railway investment over the period.
Other foreign direct investment has been reconstructed primarily based on Stone (1999), which
reports the amounts emitted in London for utilities, financial, mining, commercial and
industrial firms. Esteves (2011) database on French overseas investment and Esteves (2012)
database on German overseas investment have been used as well, since some foreign
investment in Uruguay came from these countries. These sources use information obtained
from the financial press, and the many errors in these sources are well known. For example,
securities placed for sale could later be withdrawn, but it was the initial amount that was
reported in the financial press, and therefore picked up by the databases provided by Stone and
Esteves. Vendors could also keep a portion of securities for themselves, meaning the amount
posted for sale on the stock market was less than the actual amount sold by the government
(Simon, 1968: 19). These databases give capital amounts issued on European stock markets
every year, but do not identify the specific names of the companies. Here I have tried to use
sources with more specific data, and match them with the amounts that figure in the
international databases. These sources include company reports, the Investors Monthly
Manual, international studies, such as those of Rippy (1947, 1948, 1952), and other secondary
sources, both local and international.
Total foreign investment as a percentage of GDP is shown in figure 3.1. Investment inflows
were on average 5% of GDP, but highly volatile, with large spikes in the early 1870s and late
1880s.

3.2.2. Merchandise trade balance
Uruguayan official trade statistics for the pre-1914 period are known to suffer from several
problems which make them inaccurate representations of actual payments made for goods
exported and imported. The main problem derives from the use of officially quoted prices for
many goods -valores de aforo-, rather than market prices. These official prices were used for
determining the amounts owed for tariffs and duties and, since they were adjusted only
occasionally,60 in most years the figures presented in official publications differed from the
amounts actually paid for goods crossing the border. A second problem derives from Uruguay’s
position as an entrepot for goods moved between the larger region (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay
and Bolivia) and Europe. Some goods coming especially from Argentina and Brazil were
incorrectly registered as Uruguayan exports. Furthermore, live cattle were often smuggled
across the border with Brazil, to be butchered in Brazilian salting houses, the product then
being sold within that country’s protected economy, and thus these animals were obviously not
counted in Uruguay’s official export statistics.
Bonino et al. (2015) presents a series for Uruguayan exports which corrects these factors.
Export values are calculated from export volumes from official statistics, to which a Price
Accuracy Index is applied derived from comparing export values from Uruguayan statistics
and the value of Uruguayan imports recorded by the country’s main trading partners. Further
adjustments have been made for transit trade related mis-registrations and for the existence of
cattle rustling. Figure 3.2 shows Uruguayan exports in current pounds sterling.
60 Major changes to customs tariffs and official prices were made in 1861, 1875, 1888 and 1889 (Acevedo, 1903: 165-70).

Uruguayan import data suffers from the same problems as the export statistics: goods are priced
at official values and there is misregistration or omission of the transit trade. Correcting for
these problems is more difficult than in the case of exports due to the much larger number of
products and changing categorizations and groupings that must be accounted for.
Siniscalchi et al. (2021) provide a corrected series for imports for 1883 to 1911, using a similar
methodology as for the export series. The biases in this series may be quite large, since it uses
only British prices, not those of Uruguay’s other export partners. British goods made up about
25% of total imports on average over the period. Furthermore, for some years, few matching
products could be found in order to construct the price accuracy index. Thus, this data must be
taken with caution and may be one of the main sources of error in the balance of payments
estimates. This series has been extrapolated backwards to 1870 and forwards to 1913 using the
variations in the official statistics, adjusted by an import price index from Baptista and Bértola
(1999). The results are shown in figure 3.3, along with the official statistics.61
61 It is important to note that current price series used here, since they include price effects, can hide underlying trajectories in trade volumes. Overall export growth over the period is unchanged when taken at constant prices (Bonino et al., 2015), although export volumes remained relatively stable until 1893. This is because prices of Uruguayan export goods were falling in the 1880s, even as investments made during the decade allowed for increased export volumes. After a rise in the early 1890s, export volumes stagnated in the middle of the decade, but prices began to rise soon after, leading to the increase in export values in the last 15 years of the period.

Figure 3.4 shows the merchandise trade balance as a percent of GDP that results from using
the official statistics, on one hand, and from using the corrected series, on the other. The main
difference appears during times of deterioration of the trade balance, mostly due to the sharp
increases in imports that arise from using international market prices. With the official
statistics, the trade balance is never much more than 10% of GDP in surplus or deficit. With
the corrected series, surpluses reach up to 20% of GDP (in 1904), while deficits can reach as
much as 40% of GDP (in 1873 and 1889).

3.2.3 Services and unilateral transfers
The services balance, sometimes called ‘invisible exports and imports’, contemplates non
physical goods traded across borders, such as transport, tourism, and capital and labor incomes.
For the time period under study, reconstructions of only some of these are possible, as
information on many of these items is scarce. The specific categories estimated are: freight and
insurance; tourism, interest and dividend payments sent abroad; and consular services.
The Unilateral transfers balance registers transfers of funds made without receiving
merchandise or services in exchange. These include remittances by workers, and gifts or
donations between governments, international organizations and private citizens. In the period
before 1914, the only important item in this balance was likely remittances. These were sums
sent back to the home country in Europe by immigrants, and could have a large impact on the
balance of payments of both sending and receiving countries and play an important role in
financial development of the receiving countries (Esteves and Khoudor-Castéras, 2009b).
Direct data on remittances is difficult to come by, and is therefore generally estimated indirectly
from information on the stock of recently arrived immigrants and average remittances per
migrant.
The method of estimation for each of these items is presented in appendix C. Figure 3.8 shows
the sum of the service and unilateral transfers balance, broken down into the above-mentioned
categories. As can be seen, the largest item is interest and dividend payments on foreign capital.
The second largest item is shipping and insurance, while the third largest is remittances sent
abroad by immigrants.

3.2.4 Reserve account
The final component of the balance of payments estimated here is the reserve account, which
registers the change in foreign reserves held in the country. Since Uruguay did not have
anything like a central bank throughout most of the period,62 foreign reserves in the form of
gold, some silver, and foreign currencies, were held by banks and the public.
Due to the decentralized nature of reserve holdings during the period, and the fact that a large
part of reserves was likely held outside the banking system by the public, it is difficult to
directly estimate the stock of reserves. Information on inflows and outflows of gold are
available from the AEU from 1878 to 1907, and are shown in figure 3.9.63
Figure 3.9: Net gold inflows, 1878-1907
Source: AEU.
62 Before 1907, there were multiple currency issuing banks. In 1907, the Banco de la República gained a monopoly on paper currency issue, although it had few real central banking functions (Diaz and Moreira, 2016). 63 These figures must be accepted with caution. See chapter 3, for a discussion of the reliability of gold export and import data.

1907.
3.2.5 Errors and omissions
In theory, the balance of payments should ‘close’, in the sense that if all payments are
accounted for, the capital account balance plus changes in foreign currency reserves should be
the mirror image of the current account balance. In other words, the surplus or deficit in goods,
services and unilateral transfers in a particular year must inevitably be covered by some
financial transaction or a change in reserves.
All of the items of the balance of payments estimated here can contain errors. The main source
of biases is likely the merchandise import series. Due to the large number of goods considered,
and the difficulty in collecting price data for each good, the authors applied price indices to
broad categories of goods. The estimated levels are very sensitive to the assumptions used in
this process, and biases of unknown size and direction could arise. A second source of
important source of errors could derive from the services balance, which leaves out many
important items, for example tourism before 1911, and the unilateral transfers balances, which
uses strong assumptions regarding the stock of immigrants and average amounts remitted
overseas. The capital flows series is likely biased downwards since it surely misses some
private investment flows. Furthermore, for known investments, both private and in public debt,
the dating could be off, since the date when securities appeared on European stock markets,
and the financial press, did not necessarily coincide with the date they were sold or payment
was remitted to the issuing government. This would mostly affect the largest capital influxes,
which were the occasional large government bond sales common in this period. Furthermore,
only long-term capital flows have been estimated. No effort has been made to estimate short
term capital flows, which may have been important (Bloomfield, 1963: 34-39). Finally, as
mentioned, the data on gold flows could contain biases of unknown direction, since both the
gold import and export series could be imprecise.
The extent to which the different accounts do not net out implies errors and omissions in the
data, due to problems with the sources or methodology employed. The residual errors and
omissions series derived from combining the above accounts from 1870 to 1913 is shown in


67
figure 3.10, as a percentage of GDP, and serves to “close” the balance of payments in an
accounting sense, giving an indication of how accurate the data collection efforts have been.
Figure 3.10: errors and omissions as a percent of GDP, 1878-1913
Source: see Appendices C and D.
For the most part, the different elements of the balance of payments, when combined, tell a
coherent story, although for some periods, the errors are large. From 1870 to 1877 and from
1908 to 1913, there are no data on gold flows, so the E&O series includes this omission. The
errors and omissions are generally no more than 10% of GDP. The main exception is the mid
1880s when they rise in some years to more than 25% of GDP.64 These years when the errors
are largest coincide with the massive rise in imports during the 1880s. Imports almost doubled
between 1883 and 1884, and then doubled again from 1886 to 1889. The inherent biases in the
import series are likely most prevalent when the series reaches its most extreme levels, which
could explain the large errors in this period. The other period where the series shows large
errors is from 1870 to 1875. The data for this period are necessarily prone to biases, due to the
scarcity of information. This goes for the balance of payments data as well as the GDP series.
3.2.6 The evolution of Uruguay’s balance of payments
Figure 3.11 shows the export and import series, as well as the merchandise trade balance and
current account balance, in current prices. Export values rose from 1870 to 1883, fell until
1890, and then began rising again until the end of the period, more than doubling between 1898
and 1913. Uruguay’s poor export performance in the 1880s and 1890s was in part due to falling
prices (see footnote 61), but could also have been due to the fixed exchange rate, which
64 The errors and omissions series reported for Finland, between 1890 and 1913, in Barlund (1992: 40) is of much smaller magnitude compared to Finnish GDP for the period (from Hjerppe & Pihkala, 2012, arithmetic interpolation between the figures for 1890, 1900 and 1913), with most years under 2% and a few years approaching 5%. However, trade statistics for this country do not suffer from the problem of use of official values. Furthermore, there is data on foreign assets, mostly deposits and treasury bills (short term capital) held by the bank of Finland overseas, information which is not available for Uruguay.

overvalued Uruguayan production costs relative to countries such as Argentina, which had a
similar export basket but was on a depreciating inconvertible paper currency in the 1880s.
Import values, after a spike in the early 1870s, remained relatively stable through the early
1880s. They rose dramatically from the middle of the decade, almost tripling their value
between 1883 and 1889. However, over the next two years imports fell precipitously back to
the levels of the 1870s, after which they remained essentially stable until 1904. From this year
they rose sharply, almost doubling their 1904 levels by 1913. According to this data, the
merchandise trade balance was negative before 1876, then positive until 1884, when it began
deteriorating precipitously. It returned to positive territory in 1891, due to the massive
reduction in imports, and remained so until around 1906, when it began to deteriorate once
again.

Figure 3.11 also shows the current account balance (net merchandise trade plus the services
and unilateral transfers balances) in black, in addition to the net merchandise trade account.
This allows us to see the effect of adding services trade and unilateral transfers. The negative
balance of services and unilateral transfers is typical for peripheral countries during the period,
and is largely a result of the dependence of foreign capital and foreign transport and financial

services, as well as on the massive immigration inflows, with their correspondent remittances.65
The impact of accounting for these items is to drag the balance of trade downwards. This
largely erases the trade surpluses of the late 1870s/early 1880s and the 1891 to 1905 period.
The net merchandise trade balance was positive in 24 of 44 years, while the net current account
was positive in only 12 years. In effect, the net current account for Uruguay was almost always
close to zero or negative. The only years in which large current account surpluses arose were
1883, 1895 and from 1901 to 1905.
The other important fact about the services trade and unilateral transfers balances is their
increasing importance over the period. There is an initial period, up to the late 1880s, where
these items reduce the net trade balance by about 1,000,000 pounds per year, However, starting
in the second half of the 1880s, and especially after 1891, the deficit in the services and
unilateral transfers balance becomes much larger, reducing the net trade balance by almost
2,000,000 pounds or more per year. This increase is due mostly to interest and dividend
payments abroad, which rose sharply in the late 1880s. The effect was to turn what would have
been a positive net current account for the decade after the Baring crisis into a negative one.
As discussed above, exports and imports of goods and services in Uruguay almost never
balanced each other out in any given year, that is, the net current account was almost always
in deficit. Current account imbalances can be paid for in two ways: gold and capital flows. In
Uruguay, as in many countries, large capital flows allowed imports to outpace exports for
several years at the time.
Figure 3.12 shows the net current account and long-term capital flows. As can be seen, these
two parts of the balance of payments appear to be almost mirror images of each other, revealing
that most of the current account deficits were covered by long-term capital inflows, that is,
public debt floated abroad and foreign direct investment.
65 See, for example, Barosso-Franco (1987: 47) for Brazil and Prados de la Escosura (2009: 18) for Spain.

Figure 3.12: Current, capital and reserve account balances, 1870-1913
Sources: AEU, Bonino et al (2012) and Siniscalchi et al (2021) and Appendices B and C.
Figure 3.12 also shows gold flows (dotted black line). The massive current account deficit
beginning in the mid 1880s was only partially compensated by capital inflows. The difference
was paid in gold, which flowed out at a rate of around 500,000 pounds a year until 1889. The
current account correction after the 1890 crisis led to a stabilization of gold flows, and small
current account surpluses in some years drew gold in, despite an almost total cessation of
capital inflows. Foreign investment resumed in the early 20th century, leading to a deterioration
in the current account, as imports rose. This suggests net gold outflows were negative in the
final years of the period, but lack of information impedes a direct estimate.
As mentioned in section 3.2.5, there are likely important errors in some of the estimated series.
The greatest source of bias is likely the merchandise import series, due to the large number of
goods considered, the difficulty in collecting price data for each good, and the assumptions
used to compensate for these difficulties. In the 1870s and 1880s, the corrected merchandise
import series is between 2,000,000 and 7,000,000 pounds higher than the official series. If the
correction in import prices is over estimated by, say, 50%, that is, the import series is only
between 1,000,000 and 3,500,000 pounds higher than the official series, or if corrected import
prices are underestimated by 50%, that is, the import series is between 3,000,000 and
10,500,000 pounds higher than the official series, the overall story told by the balance of
payments would not change significantly. We would still have periods of relative neutrality of
the current account, which coincide with periods of low capital inflows, and periods of severe
current account deficits, which coincide with the large waves of capital inflows. The same

could be said for the other estimated series, although the biases are likely much smaller, as well
as their effect on the accounting carried out here.66
3.3 The balance of payments and sudden stops
What is the relationship between the current account and capital flows? Conventional
international finance theories hold that current account deficits are a result of the desire for
consumption smoothing on the part of governments and private agents. Capital flows are
assumed to be accommodating to these needs. Changes in the current account arise from
changes in expected income levels (Guidotti et al, 2004: 174). Other views suggest that capital
inflows arise from a desire of foreigners to invest in a country, reflecting profitable investment
opportunities and optimism about future export growth (O’Rourke and Williamson, 2006: 303;
Borio and Distayat, 2015).
These theories have been challenged by balance of payments constrained models of growth,
which emphasize the limits that the external sector and the need for foreign exchange can place
on growth (Prebisch, 1986; Thirlwall, 2011). Export growth is limited by the demand of trading
partners, and thus by their growth rates. However, even if export demand is rising, if the income
elasticity of demand for imports is high, then the balance of payments can represent a restriction
on growth even if exports increase, since import spending rises faster than export income.
Capital inflows can lift the constraints on growth by allowing countries to increase imports by
more than what can be paid for through export growth. In theory, a country can run a sustained
current account deficit so long as foreign capital keeps flowing in and export growth keeps
pace with debt service needs (Fishlow, 1995). Nevertheless, empirical studies using Thirlwall’s
approach show that while capital inflows do allow countries to grow faster, over the long run
the effect is small relative to the effect of export growth (Thirlwall, 2011: 26-29; for Uruguay,
Donnángelo and Millán, 2006).
However, in the context of late 19th century peripheral economies, much foreign investment
went into the construction of railways, ports, urban infrastructures and other land developments
that could connect new areas to world markets and boost economy-wide productivity (Stone,
1999). Capital flows, and the large current account deficits they financed not only allowed for
consumption smoothing and satisfied demand for foreign exchange; they stimulated increased
66 See appendix D for the balance of payments series.


72
production and commercialization of exportable products, raising growth rates and generating
the foreign exchange necessary to import capital goods and service foreign debt.
If long-run growth rates were not much higher than what the balance of payments constrained
theories predict, a crucial problem may reside in the volatility of capital flows to peripheral
countries (Claessens and Gosh, 2013; Fishlow, 1985; 1995). Far from optimally adjusting to
the long-term growth needs of developing nations, capital flows had a complex relationship to
internal and external factors. Favorable conditions, such as abundant natural resources and
investor optimism about the potential for export growth could draw in foreign investment.
However, foreign investors reacted swiftly to changing domestic political and economic
circumstances, and negative perceptions about the receiving country could cause rapid halts in
capital inflows. International financial conditions could also affect investment flows, causing
rapid reversals (Accominotti and Eichengreen, 2016). This phenomenon, often called a ‘sudden
stop’, is one of the downsides of dependence on foreign investment, and was a common
occurrence in the 19th century.
Sudden stops are considered to be “financial and external” (Calvo et al., 2008: 2); this implies
that, during one of these episodes, capital flows change exogenously and the other items of the
balance of payments must adjust as a consequence. Adjustment requires either increased export
growth or a large reduction in imports (Guiditto et al., 2004: 172). If the former is not available,
the latter must be processed through painful contractions in income, currency devaluation,
changes in relative prices, or some combination of these. Reserve outflows can mitigate these
effects, but this is limited by the available stocks of foreign exchange. For countries dependent
on taxing foreign trade, like Uruguay in the 19th century, fiscal adjustments were often
necessary. In the extreme case, default on government debt, with its consequent effects on
reputation and access to international capital markets, was inevitable.
Much of the literature on sudden stops is concerned with their relationship to currency
devaluations (Guiditto et al., 2004; Edwards, 2004). However, under the gold standard,
adjustments had to occur through other means. Under fixed exchange rates, the current and
capital accounts were directly related through their effect on international reserves. If, for
example, a current account deficit was not fully compensated by capital inflows, gold reserves
flowed out. If the exchange rate was to be maintained, this implied a fall in the money supply,
with equilibrium returning to the balance of payments through the consequent effect on prices.
This is the central dynamic of the price-specie-flow models of the gold standard (Bordo, 1999:


73
8). For small countries heavily dependent on foreign trade, most prices were fixed in
international markets, and adjustment had to occur through reductions in income in order to
bring demand for imports into line with the balance of payments (Ford, 1962; Eichengreen
2008).
Many authors apply precise definitions for sudden stops, which usually refer to minimum size
of the drop in capital flows occurring over a maximum (short) period of time. The point is to
capture changes in capital flows that are cause of, rather than reactions to, balance of payments
adjustments (Calvo et al., 2008: 12). For example, Catão (2007: 254), who focuses specifically
on the first globalization period, defines a sudden stop as “as a drop (from peak to trough) [in
gross or net capital flows] of no less than two standard deviations of the deviations of respective
series from a linear trend, and/or any drop that exceeds 3 percent of GDP over a period shorter
than four years”. From 1870 to 1913, the author finds between two and four sudden stops for
a sample of 14 peripheral countries, using gross capital flows from Stone (1999).
A cursory inspection of figure 3.12 shows that Uruguay likely experienced at least one sudden
stop during the period under study. Three episodes of large falls in capital inflows can be
identified: a first in the early 1870s, a second fall in 1890 and a third towards the end of the
period. However, applying criteria such as Catão’s (2007) to a country like Uruguay creates
problems. Although Uruguay received a large amount of foreign investment relative to its size
(second only to Argentina in Latin America), the absolute amounts were small, and there were
few individual investments. Thus, a loan floated on the London Stock Market, if successful,
could imply a large rise in capital flows one year, but if no other investments were made at the
time, there would be an equally large drop the next year.67 This is not what is meant by a sudden
stop, which tries to capture the dynamics of the waves of foreign investment characteristic of
capital markets in the 19th century (and today). Another problem is the timing of sudden stops,
beginning with the year in which capital inflows peak. Some investment projects, such as
railways, once started, must be finished (to reach a city, mine or country border for example).
This may mean that even though investor sentiment has soured, capital can continue flowing
in, and even rise, the next year.
Applying Catão’s (2007) first criterion to Uruguay using the capital flows series as estimated
above, one sudden stop is detected, from 1890 to 1892. A second episode, from 1871 to 1876
67 Governments did not always receive the full value of the loan all at once.


74
comes close to meeting the two standard deviation criterion (by 96%). The third period, from
1908 to 1912, doesn’t qualify, with the reduction in capital flows equaling only one and a half
standard deviations. In regard to the second criterion, seven sudden stops are detected, which
include the two episodes just mentioned. The high number of sudden stops detected with the
second criterion is likely due to the small country problem mentioned above. Here I have
defined two sudden stops for Uruguay based on Catão’s first criterion for the size of the fall in
capital flows, although I have based the timing on when accompanying downturns began: 1873
to 1875 and 1889 to 1892.68 A third period, from 1908 to 1912, cannot be considered a sudden
stop, but is examined in comparison to the first two periods to highlight the differences in
adjustments required by a sudden stop scenario. These waves of foreign investment coincide
with cycles observed for other Latin American countries and at the global level (Kaminsky,
2017).69
Each of these sudden stops was preceded by a rapid increase in capital flows. Figure 3.16 shows
capital flows and GDP from 1870 to 1913, while Table 3.1 shows the years of run-ups in capital
flows and the periods of sudden stops, with the corresponding percentage growth in GDP and
annual growth rates during the upswing and downswing periods.
Figure 3.16: capital flows and GDP, 1870-1913
Sources: Capital flows, see Appendix B; GDP, Román and Willebald (2019).
68 These periods coincide with the general periods of downswings in capital flows for the sample of countries in Catão (2007). 69 Several authors have highlighted the cyclical aspects of the Uruguayan economy and its effect on long-term growth (Bértola and Lorenzo, 2004; Carbajal and De Melo, 2007; Oddone, 2010). In general, they relate economic cycles, in part, to volatility in financial variables such as capital inflows and domestic bank deposits and credit. They furthermore identify institutional features that are in part a reaction to economic volatility, but at the same time tend to increase the amplitude of cycles. For example, Carbajal and De Melo (2007: 24) suggest that volatility in Uruguay causes the substitution of currencies, reliance on short-term contracts, frequent regulatory changes and an uncertain nominal anchor. These weaknesses in the country’s financial architecture tend to amplify shocks and increase volatility.

The first major wave of foreign investment in Uruguay occurred at the beginning of the
1870s,70 driven by the Uruguayan government’s second ever external loan, the Emprestito
Uruguayo of 1871. This large loan led to a peak in investment, and despite falling off
somewhat, private investment in the country’s first railway line, an expansion of the Liebig’s
Extract of Beef Company plant in beginning in 1870, and major gas works, telegraph and land
investments in 1872 led to continued capital inflows up to 1873. This led to growth rates in
GDP of around 13% per year. However, the first sudden stop, from 1873 to 1875, erased over
one third of the growth that had been achieved during the wave of foreign investment in the
first years of the decade.
This sudden stop was accompanied by social and economic upheaval that began in 1873,
sparked by an outbreak of yellow fever in Montevideo and the collapse of the Banco Franco
Platense, and which led to a major crisis in 1875 (Acevedo, 1933a: 731, 790). When capital
flows dried up, the main adjustment mechanism seems to have been import compression, aided
by the fall in output mentioned above. Import values fell by half, from around 9,000,000 pounds
in 1873 to 4,900,000 pounds in 1875, while exports remained stable. Data on gold flows are
not available for these years, but it is likely that reserves flowed out after 1873, considering the
deficit in the balance of payments even with the dramatic fall in imports, as well as the wave
of bank failures in 1877/76. The most important bank to fail was the Mauá, the largest bank in
the country, which was unable to continue converting its notes in 1875 and was liquidated in
1876.71 While the government took over the debts of the Banco Mauá and tried to impose
70 Before 1870, the only large capital inflows were the Empréstito Montevideano-Europeo, the government’s first external loan, in 1864, and the initial capital for the Liebig’s Extract of Beef Company, established in 1865. 71 Among the other banks that failed was the Banco Navía & Cia, which closed its doors in 1875, along with the Banco Union, the Banco Alemán-Belga, the Banco Mercantil de Rio de la Plata, the Banco Herrera Eastman & Cia and the Banco Villaamil & Cia (Banco Central del Uruguay [BCU]). These banks are assumed to have failed in 1875 or 1876, as they are not mentioned in any primary or secondary sources after these years.


76
inconvertible paper currency on the market, the surviving banks and commercial houses
resisted by declaring that all debts had to be paid in gold, despite government decrees to the
contrary, and refusing to do business with anyone who accepted depreciated notes (Acevedo,
1933a: 788-792). The fiscal situation of the government was gravely affected, in part due to
the fact that most tax revenue came from levies on imports (Bertino and Millot, 1996). Tax
revenues fell by one quarter between 1873 and 1875, and the government defaulted on its
foreign debt in 1876.
The second major wave of foreign investment came at the end of the 1880s. Capital had started
flowing in during the first part of the decade, with the government’s third external loan in 1883
and investment in telephone networks, waterworks and the expansion and entrance of several
British banks. However, from 1887 to 1889, investment soared, with two more external loans
being floated in 1888, three major railway lines initiating construction72 and further
investments in urban infrastructures and financial companies. A major crisis befell the country
in 1890, concurrent with a crisis in Argentina the same year. This episode, known as the Baring
Crisis, due to its effect on the British bank of that name which failed when investors rejected
the Argentine and Uruguayan government bonds it was marketing for sale in London, almost
brought down the British financial system and forced the Bank of England to step in and
organize orderly exit for Baring (Clapham, 1944). The consequent sudden stop was major. Net
capital inflows peaked in 1890, at almost 4,500,000 pounds (500,000 higher than in 1889),
mostly due to the construction of railway lines that had been started a few years earlier and
could not be left half completed. By 1892 capital flows were negative. The annual growth rate
had been on average 16% from 1887 to 1889, but fully two thirds of this was wiped out by
1892. The crisis had long-lasting effects, with GDP not reaching its previous peak until almost
the close of the century.
This sudden stop shared many characteristics with the earlier episode. The main adjustment
mechanism was through a reduction in imports, which fell from over 15,000,000 pounds in
1889 to less than 5,000,000 in 1892. Exports did not help the situation, in fact falling by 35%
during the sudden stop. Almost 1,000,000 pounds of gold had flowed out in 1889, as it had
throughout the second half of the 1880s, but during the sudden stop, gold flows stabilized,
being slightly positive in 1890 and 1891, and slightly negative in 1892. Just as in the earlier
72 These were the Central Uruguay Railway Eastern Extension, the Central Uruguay Railway Northern Extension and the Midland Uruguay Railway Company.


77
episode, the largest bank in 1890, the Banco Nacional, stopped converting its notes in July of
that year. While the government tried to keep it running through the crisis, the bank was forced
to close in the second half of 1891 (Acevedo, 1903: 268, 273). During the suspension of
convertibility, the banking and merchant community resisted, just as they had in 1875, meaning
that most business continued honoring debts in gold (Acevedo, 1903: 270-71). Tax revenues
fell by 20% between 1890 and 1892, and the government defaulted on its external debt in 1891.
As mentioned earlier, the drop in capital flows from 1908 to 1912 was not a sudden stop; rather,
it was simply a downward adjustment in capital inflows after a particularly large burst of
activity following the resumption of public debt emissions in 1905, with the Empréstito de
Conversion,73 as well as the construction of tramways in Montevideo, the extension of railway
lines in the interior of the country and the continued expansion of urban infrastructures.
Although capital flows peaked in 1908 at 3,000,000 pounds, a new, large external loan was
floated in 1909. In addition, the 1905 loan had converted old internal debts, and thus around
63% of it was in the hands of Uruguayan residents. However, demand for Uruguayan debt was
so strong that almost half of these external bonds held by residents were exported overseas by
1913. There were also further investments in industrial enterprises, specifically meatpacking
plants beginning in 1911. Thus, despite the drop off in capital inflows after 1908, foreign
investment still flowed in an average of 1,5000,000 pounds per year over the following years.
Although capital flows fell by 57% between 1908 and 1912, adjustment was much different
than in earlier episodes. In this case, there was no import compression to speak of. Import
values almost doubled from 1905 to 1908, and rose by another 38% by 1912. Export growth,
although it did not keep up with imports, collaborated by rising by around 30% during the
capital flow upswing and another 30% during the fall. There is no data on gold flows after
1907, but reserves in banks peaked in 1909 and had fallen by 30% by 1912. This doesn’t
necessarily mean gold flowed out of the country; it could imply gold hoarding by residents,
perhaps due to perceived banking sector weakness. However, the large balance of payments
deficit suggests that it was likely met by large gold outflows. Nevertheless, during this episode,
convertibility of notes, -the exchange rate-, was not threatened. Furthermore, GDP grew at an
annual rate of 10% and the government’s fiscal situation was not threatened during this period
73 Between the consolidation loan of 1892 which allowed an exit from the crisis initiated in 1890, and the 1905 Emprestito de Conversión, there was only one external loan floated, in 1896, to finance the founding of the BROU.


78
In none of these episodes did exchange rate depreciation act as an escape valve, although during
the two sudden stops, it came quite close. As mentioned, the government suspended
convertibility temporarily during both episodes. What prevented depreciation was the banking
and commercial community actively resisting the government’s attempts to exit the gold
standard. The reason they came so close to devaluing during the sudden stops can be seen by
examining the monetary situation during the preceding booms.
3.4 Banks, the money supply, the exchange rate and adjustment74
Under the gold standard, if the exchange rate is to be preserved, over the long run bank
liabilities (notes in circulation plus deposits) and credit must be kept close enough in line with
banking sector reserves so as for demand for gold to be met without problems. Banks can
increase credit and liabilities as gold flows into their coffers, but not beyond prudent limits,
and must reduce them as gold flows out. Figure 3.17 shows reserves, liabilities and credit of
the Uruguayan banking sector from 1870 to 1913. All three episodes of capital inflows we have
been examining are associated with large increases in liabilities and credit, and a growing gap
between these and reserves. The two sudden stops also saw a drop in reserves. In the first
episode, reserves fell by 40% in the year capital flows peaked. In the 1889 episode, reserves
also fell off slightly in that year compared to the year before, and then dropped by 47% by
1891. In 1908, however, while capital flows began to fall, bank reserves continued to rise until
1910, after which they fell sharply.

Figure 3.18 shows the ratio of bank reserves to liabilities. In 1873, this ratio had fallen to 22%,
that is, only about one fifth of notes in circulation and deposits were backed by reserves. When
capital flows peaked in 1889, this ratio was 28%, and dropped to 22% in 1890. In 1908,
however, the reserve ratio was 47%: almost half of liabilities were backed by reserves. Rising
liabilities meant that the ratio deteriorated, but was still at 30% by 1912.
Figure 3.19 shows reserves, liabilities and credit as a percent of GDP, which helps put the large
rises in liabilities and credit during each episode of capital flow reduction into perspective.
During all three moments of capital inflows, reserves in banks rose to around 20% of GDP.
However, in the 1873 episode, liabilities were between 55% and 65% of GDP, while credit was
55% to 70%. In the 1889 episode, liabilities rose to 71% of GDP in 1890, and credit reached
89% in 1891. This contrast greatly with what occurred in the last episode studied. In the early
20th century, liabilities and credit had kept pace with GDP growth. In 1908, they both equaled
around 32% of GDP.

The above information helps explain why the exchange rate was put in danger in the 1870s and
1890, with the government decreeing inconvertibility, while there was no such problem in the
later period. Although gold did flow in to banks’ coffers during periods of capital inflows,
money expansion greatly outstripped this growth, driving the reserve ratio to dangerously low
levels. These rapid monetary expansions also fueled speculative bubbles (Acevedo, 1933a:
731; 1934a: 438-39; Winn, 2010: 166-173). A perception on the part of investors of
overinvestment, monetary imprudence and speculation led to sudden stops in both periods. In

both cases, the temptation to devaluate was strong, and only the relative independence of the
banking and commercial communities kept the government’s efforts to exit the gold standard
from sticking. Low reserves meant that the monetary expansion had to be liquidated through
painful contraction, which led to reductions in output and economic stagnation.
By the beginning of the 20th century, the banking sector had accumulated reserves to a much
greater degree. Furthermore, although bank money and credit grew rapidly, it did not outpace
GDP, and therefore did not spur speculative activity like in the earlier episodes. In addition,
the high level of reserves likely meant the banking sector could meet the downturn in capital
inflows by allowing gold to flow out. This is in part why we do not see a current account
correction in these years. Meeting a capital downturn with gold outflows would not have been
sustainable indefinitely. However, with strong export and output growth, capital would likely
have begun to flow back in soon (indeed, capital flows increased in 1913). The stronger
economy and the more solid position of the banking sector at the end of the period likely
allowed the country to avoid a major current account correction like in earlier episodes.
3.5 Conclusions
This chapter presents a reconstruction of Uruguay’s balance of payments, including new
estimates of the capital account and the services trade balance and the unilateral transfers
balance. It also uses corrected series for merchandise trade and provides an estimate of gold
flows. In addition, the banking sector balance sheet is reconstructed, which allows for
estimation of banking sector reserves, monetary aggregates and for the calculation of banking
sector liquidity. This type of information is scarce for peripheral countries during the period,
and these reconstructions therefore constitute one of the main contributions of this thesis.
The time series presented here are used to investigate the phenomenon of sudden stops in
Uruguay during the first globalization. Since the country was on the gold standard for most of
the period, changes in the domestic money supply were intimately tied to the balance of
payments. One of the most consequential elements of the balance of payments was capital
flows, which suffered several sharp declines over the period.
Three periods of downturns in capital inflows are studied: 1873 to 1875, 1889 to 1892 and
1908 to 1912. The first two can be defined as sudden stops. The third cannot. Under the gold
standard, currency devaluation was not an option for adjusting to a sudden stop. However,
during Uruguay’s two episodes of this nature, depreciation was tempting for the government,


81
and the exchange rate was almost broken. This can be explained by the fact that Uruguay was
not very prudent in monetary terms with regard to the gold standard. Monetary expansion
during the capital inflows of the early 1870s and late 1880s was enormous, far outstripping
GDP growth. This made reserve ratios to fall. Since preservation of the exchange rate was
made a priority, and low gold reserves made reserve outflows a non-viable option for
adjustment, a massive current account correction was needed in both sudden stop episodes.
Imports were compressed in both cases, since exports did not respond (which is to be expected
without currency depreciation). There was also a severe downturn in output, and several years
of stagnation after each episode. During the reduction of capital inflows starting in 1908, the
banking sector was in a much different position. Gold reserves were high, as were reserve
ratios. Furthermore, monetary growth, though high, had been in line with GDP growth. This
allowed imports to continue rising despite falling foreign investment. The adjustment
mechanism likely occurred via gold outflows, although there is no clear data on this.
The story of sudden stops highlights the difficulties that peripheral countries had in adhering
to the gold standard. There was a temptation to break the rules of the game and expand money
beyond what was prudent. However, foreign investors responded to financial news in
borrowing countries, and could withdraw capital if they came to believe there was a risk that
investments would not be repaid. Many countries, when faced with falls in capital inflows and
the consequent pressure on the balance of payments, decided to exit the gold standard and allow
their currencies to depreciate. Uruguay, when faced with this situation, remained steadfast, and
suffered the consequences in terms of erasure of earlier growth.


82
Chapter 4: Uruguay, Argentina, the gold standard and the 1890 Crisis
4.1 Introduction
Financial crises appear to be recurrent and catastrophic for developing countries, leading to
halts in foreign investment, currency devaluation, debt default and credit contractions. The
need for foreign investment in developing countries exposes them to international shocks.
Export price volatility or sudden stops in capital inflows can put strain on the capacity to pay
back loans and thus precipitate crises. An important aim of government policy is avoiding
financial crises. However, inappropriately managed exchange rate, monetary and fiscal policies
can not only fail to avoid crises, but can directly contribute to them (Claessens et al., 2014).
Large fiscal deficits, over indebtedness and debt monetization put countries in a weak position
to respond to shocks, and can themselves precipitate crises if they lead investors to lose
confidence or cause inflation.
One of the most famous of these events was the Baring Crisis of 1890, named after the London
merchant bank whose inability to meet payment obligations related to Argentine securities set
off an international financial panic. The crisis gravely affected the Argentine economy, and
had knock on effects in many other Latin American countries. Furthermore, the crisis shook
the British capital market, forcing the Bank of England to ask its counterparts in other European
countries for loans in order to provide liquidity and bolster confidence. The crisis also impacted
countries further afield, such as Spain, Portugal, Australia, New Zealand and Turkey, which
had trouble accessing international capital markets in the early 1890s (Marichal, 1989: 121;
Eichengreen, 1992: 250). Uruguay was perhaps the country most directly affected,
experiencing a severe downturn concurrently with the Argentine crisis.
There is an extensive literature about the Argentine Baring Crisis, with a major area of debate
centering on its causes. Did overeager investors place too much faith in the capacity of the
Argentine economy to produce returns which could sustain indebtedness? Did the structure of
financial markets blind investors to the country’s deteriorating position? Or was Argentine


83
government policy to blame? In particular, the role of Argentina’s floating exchange rate has
been the subject of intense scrutiny. Williams (1920) and Ford (1956; 1962) used Argentina as
a case study of how balance of payments adjustments operated under an inconvertible paper
currency. However, despite their emphasis on the exchange rate, they both conclude that
external factors were the major cause of the crisis, in particular over lending in the 1880s and
the subsequent ebbing of capital flows at the end of that decade. Other authors have disagreed,
highlighting the role played by monetary expansion, paper currency depreciation, inflation, and
their relationship to fiscal deficits, in the lead up to the crisis (Cortés Conde, 1989; della Paolera
and Taylor, 2001).
The Uruguayan experience offers an important contrast to the Argentine case. Unlike
Argentina, Uruguay was on the gold standard almost without interruption from 1876 to 1913.
It exited briefly when currency inconvertibility was declared in July of 1890, due to the crisis,
but returned to gold soon after at its earlier par value.75 The country managed most of its time
on the gold standard with no central bank to speak of, operating under a free banking system
until the early 20th century. This was very different from Argentina’s system where large state
banks dominated the banking sector. It also goes against the predictions of the standard theory
on the gold standard, which highlights the reinforcing mechanisms present in core countries
and how they were absent in peripheral countries, and thus explain why these in general had a
difficult time remaining in the regime (Eichengreen, 2008: 37-41).
The main theme of literature on the Baring Crisis regards the causes of financial instability in
peripheral countries. Were profligate governments to blame? Or can the causes be traced to the
nature of international financial markets during the period? This chapter investigates these
questions through a comparison of the Argentine and Uruguayan crises, allowing us to put
some of the research on the former country into relief. In particular, the assertion that
Argentina’s monetary policy was a key factor in the crisis can be tested in light of Uruguay’s
different policy environment. While Argentina used inconvertible paper currency starting in
1885, the Uruguayan commercial and banking communities resisted attempts to depart from
monetary orthodoxy throughout the 1880s (Barrán and Nahum, 1971). While monetary
expansion did occur as a result of the actions of the Banco Nacional in Uruguay and the banking
boom of the final years of the 1880s, only as a result of the crisis in 1890 was the country
forced to declare inconvertibility, returning to convertibility at par soon after. The specific
75 See appendix E for a discussion of exactly how long Uruguay was off gold.


84
questions to be explored regard the role of exchange rate policy in the 1890 crisis. What were
the economic effects of Uruguay’s adherence to the gold standard in the leadup to the crisis?
This question is explored in two ways. First, through a direct comparison of both countries’
banking sectors, monetary aggregates and debt in the buildup to the crisis. Second, through an
examination of the financial links between the two countries, and the role they may have had
in Uruguay’s ability to maintain a fixed exchange rate.
The evidence presented here shows that, up to around 1887, Uruguay’s banking sector played
by the rules of the game regarding the gold standard, maintaining gold reserves in sufficient
amounts to back paper currency issue and deposits, and economic adjustments occurred as one
would expect for a small peripheral economy. After 1887, the rules were broken by some
banks, with note and deposit growth outstripping growth of bank reserves, finally putting the
exchange rate at risk in 1890. Uruguayans reacted to monetary expansion much as Argentines
did, by hoarding gold, draining reserves from the banking system. The burden of public debt
in relation to government revenues was lower than that of its neighbor, implying that Uruguay
avoided one of the negative consequences of flexible exchange rates. Furthermore, there is
evidence that Uruguay benefited from the monetary chaos of its neighbor in the 1880s by
receiving gold inflows from her, which cushioned the effects of overall gold losses to the rest
of the world. These gold inflows were likely induced by gold adherence and the relative safety
offered by Uruguay’s banking system.
The rest of the chapter is organized as follows. Section 3.2 examines the historiography of the
Argentine and Uruguayan crises, and offers brief descriptions of events in each country in the
1880s and early 1890s. Section 3.3 analyzes the evolution of the money supply in both
countries, focusing on the stock and distribution of gold between banks and the public. Section
3.4 discusses the burden of public debt in government revenues, while section 3.5 looks at the
financial links between Argentina and Uruguay and the possible effects they might have had
on Uruguay’s banking sector. Section 3.6 offers some concluding remarks.
4.2 Historiography and history of the crisis
4.2.1 The historiography of the Argentine crisis
The Argentine version of the 1890 crisis has been studied in depth. Discussion of the crisis
generally frames the debate as being about the relative weight of internal versus external
factors. Contemporary writers placed emphasis on internal factors, especially over issue of


85
notes by the banking system and government deficits (Cortés Conde, 1989: 212-13). However,
in the first major treatment by an economic historian, Argentine International Trade under
Inconvertible paper money: 1880-1900, Williams (1920: 102) stressed the importance of
external factors. Although he recognized the role of the issuance of paper currency, he focused
on the balance of payments as the primary cause of financial collapse and currency
depreciation. “There can be no question that ... the predominating cause of the crisis was
borrowings, intensified, to be sure, by inconvertible paper currency, the depreciation of which
was due quite as much to the collapse of borrowings as to the over-issue of paper money”
(Williams, 1920: 104). Gold outflows in 1889 were caused by the ebbing of capital inflows
and the increase in interest payments on foreign debt. The reduction in capital inflows was a
reaction by investors to what by then had become clear was massive over borrowing. “Such
borrowings as this would in all likelihood have occasioned a panic even without the presence
of depreciated paper” (Williams, 1920: 104). The fall in foreign investment, together with the
burden of interest payments, caused the government to default on its debt in 1890, setting off
the panic known as the Baring Crisis.
For Ford as well, the main cause of the crisis was the relation between fixed interest loans and
the balance of trade. Shortfalls in export earnings could be covered by capital inflows to meet
interest payments and import demand as long as foreign investors remained confident in the
country’s potential for producing economic returns. The “excessive issue of notes and
extravagant banking policies formed a contributory feature of the crisis of 1890” (Ford, 1962:
100). For Ford, the most important consequence of depreciating paper currency was its
distributive effects. Landowners received income in gold, while most costs, -wages, rents and
domestically produced (non-traded) goods-, were in depreciated paper currency. Furthermore,
paper currency denominated debts would reduce their real value compared to gold incomes.
Landowners therefore viewed currency depreciation favorably, and indeed lobbied for it (Ford,
1956: 131-32).76
The role of the balance of payments and especially the importance of capital flows has
remained central to most accounts of the crisis in the century since Williams’ publication. It
was what Ford (1962: 127) called a “crisis of development” or Fishlow (1985: 403) a
“developmental default”. It is essentially a problem of miscalculation on the part of market
76 Conversely, landowners were hurt by currency appreciation, and thus lobbied for a return to fixed exchange rates in times of rising export prices and falling gold premiums (Ford, 1956: 132, footnote 1).


86
participants on how long it would take for long term investments in railways and land
improvements to mature and generate export earnings. The role of governments, and their
fiscal, monetary and exchange rate policies play only a secondary role in this view.
Why this miscalculation occurred is difficult to know. Some authors, delving into the
microeconomics of international financial markets, have pointed out how certain aspects of the
international financial system may have skewed incentives in a manner that led to
overinvestment. For example, Flores (2011) posits that competition between banks for the
privilege of handling initial public offerings for Argentine government debt issues allowed
Argentina to continue borrowing throughout the 1880s, at decreasing costs, despite
deteriorating economic fundamentals. Flores (2010) suggests that information asymmetries,
due to the control of information flows by Baring, also contributed to investor enthusiasm for
Argentine debt even though the government’s weak position could have been known to the
investing public.
However, some have questioned the idea that the cause of the crisis can be traced primarily to
external factors. For example, Eichengreen (1999: 250) states that “monetary and fiscal
excesses were a principal element in the crisis”, while Bernholz (1984: 673) stresses that
external factors cannot be blamed: recessions in Argentina’s major trading partners post-dated
the crisis, the general level of exports remained high through 1890 and international interest
rates remained stable. Marichal (1989: 121) claims the 1890 crisis was “unleashed
fundamentally by the crash of the Argentine economy. More than any other factor it was the
bankruptcy of the Argentine state banks and of the government itself that led to the downfall
of Baring Brothers”. Cortés Conde develops this notion in his work on the fiscal and monetary
history of Argentina, pointing to the policies of the Argentine government –large fiscal deficits,
massive monetary expansion and government intervention in the gold market to slow currency
depreciation– in the years leading up to the crisis as the main causes. Massive spending on
public works was covered by enormous increases in external debt, which almost doubled from
1884 to 1890. At the same time, note issue expanded drastically, almost tripling between 1887
and 1890, while the gold premium almost doubled over the same period (Cortés Conde, 1989:
182, 190, 210). Ever since the country had exited the gold standard in 1885, the unit of measure
for payment of taxes had been paper pesos, meaning that currency depreciation eroded
government revenues. The banking reform of 1887 had placed the gold reserves of the
guaranteed banks in the hands of the Banco Nacional, who sold them in an intent to stall


87
currency depreciation. For Cortés Conde, the explanation for the crisis lies in these monetary
factors. Argentina’s long history with fiat money and depreciation meant that the public reacted
to deficits and note expansion by hoarding gold (what the author terms “capital flight”),
neutralizing the effect of government intervention in the gold market (Cortés Conde, 1989:
220). The result was mass gold exports, with consequent effects on the balance of payments
and the exchange rate. These authors do not claim that external forces did not matter, only that
government policies directly contributed to the crisis.
Monetary factors also figure centrally in Della Paolera and Taylor’s (2001) explanation of the
crisis, but they frame the discussion in terms of the policy trilemma: the incompatibility of
maintaining exchange rate stability, free movement of capital and an independent monetary
policy. For these authors, inconsistency in government policy was the main culprit. On one
hand, it sought to stabilize the currency and prices, communicating its intention to return to the
gold standard and intervening in the gold market to prevent currency depreciation. On the other,
it used the banking system to finance deficits in order to fuel the economic expansion of the
late 1880s. When capital inflows slowed, it chose to abandon exchange rate stability, with
consequent impacts on prices, government revenues and the public’s willingness to hold paper
currency. They refer to the 1890 event as the first modern emerging market crisis, because it
involved many of the same factors we have seen in financial collapses in recent decades. These
authors contrast Argentina’s experience in the 1880s with later years, when it managed to
establish a “nominal anchor” by adhering to the gold standard from 1900 to 1914, which set
the stage for the country’s spectacular economic performance in the early part of the 20th
century.77
Della Paolera and Taylor (2001) view the government’s actions in the 1880s in a negative light:
monetary and financial stability are necessary ingredients of long-term development. The
government was not willing to practice the fiscal discipline necessary to provide this “nominal
anchor”, thus precipitating the crisis and negatively affecting economic performance.
However, authors like Duncan (1983) take a different view: the financial collapse of 1890 can
be regarded as a failure of the monetary regime, but must be viewed in light of the uses to
which foreign investment, especially public borrowing, was put. Deficits financed massive
77 Della Paolera and Taylor (2001:17) suggest that the policy reaction to the crisis –an orthodox monetary reform centered on the creation of a currency board– “changed the course of Argentine economic history, and still, through its influence on the design of Cavallo’s convertibility plan, is making itself felt today”. It is ironic that their book was published in 2001, the same year as the failure of Cavallo’s convertibility plan and Argentina’s greatest financial collapse since the Baring Crisis.


88
railway investment, public works, support for immigration and other developmental activities,
which laid the groundwork for the country’s move to higher value pastoral products and the
creation of export agriculture in the late-19th and early 20th centuries. The financial collapse
was an inevitable consequence of the government’s fiscal policies, but may have been a price
worth paying. Fishlow (1987) also suggests that inconvertible currency and monetary
expansion could have been the rational choice for a country in Argentina’s position.
One strand of literature has studied the issue of contagion, that is, the financial consequences
of the Baring crisis for other countries. For example, Triner (2001) focuses on the effect of the
Argentine crisis on Brazil, arguing that open capital markets and similar fundamental
conditions in both countries caused capital flows to dry up for Brazil after the Argentine
collapse. Mitchener and Weidenmier (2008) examine bond yields for 28 emerging markets.
They find that yields rose for Latin American economies in the years after the crisis, although
not for other countries, and conclude that contagion appears to have been a regional affair.
These authors include Uruguay in their sample, thus treating it as another case of contagion.
However, in the case of Argentina’s eastern neighbor, this may not be the most useful way of
looking at the crisis. The investment booms in Uruguay and Argentina in the second half of the
1880s and the subsequent crisis may be looked at as part of the same process, due to their
timing and the close economic ties between the two countries.
The Uruguayan crisis has been less studied than its neighbor’s. Its investment boom and
financial crisis resembled events in Argentina in many ways. According to Winn (2010: 215),
Uruguayan contemporaries blamed mostly external factors, such as the cyclical nature of
British capital flows, the greed of British financiers and the Argentine crisis, while the British
perspective placed blame on Uruguayan politicians and the absence of a forward-thinking
mentality on the part of the Uruguayan public. The 20th century historiography of the crisis has
tended to focus on the speculative nature of the 1880s boom and on collusion between the
government and a small clique of financiers. The best account of the crisis can be found in
Acevedo (1903: 260-85; 1934a: 438-39), where the government’s role, and especially that of
the Banco Nacional, is detailed. Acevedo places a large part of the blame for the crisis on the
Bank’s profligacy in terms of credit expansion and speculative activity. Winn (2010: 166-173)
claims that a large part of the enormous flows of foreign capital arriving in the 1880s were
directed towards speculative activity, rather than developing the country’s resources, and that
a fragile institutional and economic structure contributed to the crisis. One of the only writers


89
to directly compare the situation of Argentina and Uruguay, Morató (1926: 35), remarks that
while the 1880s boom in the former was associated with increasing price inflation, the same
did not occur in the latter, and that outside the stock market and real estate, prices actually fell.
These approaches to the Uruguayan crisis have tended to be purely descriptive, and quantitative
analysis has been lacking.
Thus, studying the Uruguayan crisis can provide an interesting contrast to Argentina’s
experience. The country experienced an investment boom of similar magnitude to that of its
neighbor in the 1880s and a crisis with many of the same characteristics in 1890. However, one
important difference between Argentina and Uruguay was their differing experiences in terms
of adherence to the gold standard. The rest of this chapter studies the crisis in comparative
terms, putting the focus on consequences of this policy difference.
4.2.2 The boom of the 1880s and the 1890 crisis in Argentina
The 1880s was a prosperous decade for Argentina, with expansion of livestock and agricultural
production, the founding of new industries, rising exports and massive capital and immigration
inflows. A short-lived attempt at joining the gold standard, made law in 1881 and operational
in July of 1883, failed at the end of 1884, when the inconvertibility of paper pesos was decreed
(Della Paolera and Taylor, 2001: 47). This, however, did not deter massive foreign investment
flows to the country through the rest of the decade. In the ten years from 1881 to 1890,
Argentina received over 135 million pounds in foreign investment. These inflows peaked in
1889 at around 22% of GDP (see Figure 4.1, below). Over half was foreign direct investment
in private undertakings, mostly railways (40% of total investment), urban infrastructures like
tramways, waterworks and gas, as well as industrial, agricultural and financial enterprises.
However, 46% was absorbed by the state, which emitted bonds with a value of over 60 million
pounds.78 The state used funds to cover current spending, but also for investments in
infrastructure, such as railway lines (some built directly, others by private investors with a
state-backed interest guarantee) and port works.
However, by mid-decade, cracks had already begun to appear in the financial structure upon
which the boom was built. The second half of the decade was characterized by massive
monetary expansion, currency depreciation and inflation. The Banco Nacional and the Banco

de la Provincia de Buenos Aires (BPBA), the country’s two largest banks, expanded note issue
more than threefold and deposits by more than twofold between 1885 and 1890 (Cortés Conde,
1989: 158, 190). Other banks of issue existed in the interior of the country, but their notes did
not circulate outside of their respective provinces. The Law of Guaranteed banks, intended to
unify the country’s note issue, guaranteed the notes of provincial banks if they purchased, with
gold, specially designated bonds of the federal government. Provincial governments floated
external debt in London in order to acquire gold for the operation; investors eagerly purchased
this debt that in theory had a ‘triple guarantee’ (that of the Provincial government, the
Provincial bank which they were intended to finance and, most importantly, the Federal
government; Cortés Conde, 1989: 195-97). These banks had added another 20% to the
economy’s note circulation by 1890. Private banks expanded credit sevenfold between 1884
and 1887 (Regalsky, 1999: 41).79 In consequence, the exchange rate between paper currency
and gold rose fourfold between 1884 and 1890, and prices jumped 25% in 1887, and rose
another 17% by 1890 (Ferreres, 2005).
Debt service weighed heavily on government budgets, made worse by currency depreciation
which reduced the gold value of tax revenue. As long as new capital flowed in, spending could
keep pace with the needs of the expanding economy. However, in the face of deteriorating
revenues, the government decided in early 1889 to pay off in paper money internal debts
denominated in gold, which technically meant it was in default (Della Paolera and Taylor,
2001: 24). This sparked concern among investors, and capital inflows ebbed that year, falling
to less than half their value in 1888.
In order to halt paper currency depreciation (what contemporaries referred to as a rise in the
gold premium), the government began intervening in the foreign exchange market in 1886
(Cortés Conde, 1989: 220-21, 246-47). The sale of the gold reserves of the Banco Nacional
was at first effective, the exchange rate rising only about 7% between 1886 and 1888. However,
it jumped 28% in 1889, by which time the reserves of the bank were almost exhausted. The
problem was that the intervention of the Banco Nacional meant gold was undervalued with
respect to paper (the policy had essentially created a gold export point), prompting the shipment
of gold overseas. As a response, in March of 1889 the government resorted to banning trading
of gold on the stock market (Cortes Conde, 1989: 221).
79 Unless otherwise noted, monetary and banking figures for Argentina are quoted in paper peso terms. If quoted in terms of gold equivalency, growth rates would be lower.


91
One of the key moments of the crisis revolves around the flotation by Barings of shares of the
Buenos Ayres Water Supply & and Drainage Company Ltd. Barings began circulating the
prospectus in London in January of 1889. The amount offered on the market was massive: 8.5
million pounds in shares and debentures, for purchase of the concession, partially constructed
works and to expand the water and sanitation network (Ferns, 1992: 251). By the end of the
year, it was clear that the flotation had been unsuccessful, leaving Barings exposed and
revealing the reticence of investors to continue funding the Argentine economy. This, along
with news about exhaustion of gold reserves, prompted a run on the Banco Nacional and the
BPBA in early 1890. The government responded by allowing the banks to increase their note
issue, with consequent effects on the exchange rate, which rose by 32% in 1890 and 55% in
1891 (Della Paolera and Taylor, 2001: 70-71).
In July of 1890, the Banco Nacional communicated to Barings that it was suspending debt
service on Argentine external debt. Rioting in Buenos Aires over the next weeks forced the
resignation of the President, Juárez Celman (Ferns, 1992: 258). The new government, led by
Celman’s Vice President, Carlos Pellegrini, undertook the task of reining in the government’s
finances and reforming the financial system, as well as renegotiating Argentina’s debt with
external creditors. Barings’ situation became public in November of 1890, when the authorities
in London arranged a rescue package for the bank (Clapham, 1944: 327, 335).
In January of 1891 a funding loan was extended to Argentina, in order for it to meet its
payments on external obligations. The conditions tied to the loan prevented expansion of note
issue, causing the Banco Nacional and the BPBA, the two largest banks, to close their doors in
April of that year (della Paolera and Tayor, 2001: 100-05). This set off a generalized banking
panic, straining the reserves of private banks, causing a wave of failures and a contraction of
credit.
The crisis prompted policy makers to institute a drastic reform of monetary, banking and fiscal
institutions. The monetary reform centered on the creation of a currency board, which was
designed to eventually issue paper currency in exchange for gold at a one-to-one ratio, making
changes in note circulation respond strictly to gold movements and removing the ability of the
government to use money creation to cover deficits. The “Caja de Conversión” began operating
at the end of 1890, with the explicit goal of returning the country to the gold standard at its
earlier parity. This idea, however, was eventually abandoned, as the deflation necessary to
achieve this would have been ruinous. After several years of currency appreciation beginning


92
in 1894, the exchange rate was finally fixed in 1900, at 2.27 paper pesos per gold peso (della
Paolera and Taylor, 2001: 119). At the same time as the currency board was established, note
issuance was denied to banks, and the two largest banks, the Banco Nacional and the BPBA,
along with several others, were allowed to fail. The Banco de la Nación was founded in 1891,
to replace the failed Banco Nacional. Fiscal reforms broadened the tax base in order to make
revenues less dependent on international trade, and a long, painful, external debt renegotiation
ensued, which temporarily lowered the burden of debt service until the country could get back
on its feet (Della Paolera and Taylor, 2001: 33, 100-09).
4.3.3 The boom and crisis in Uruguay
Uruguay in the 1880s shared many aspects with its larger neighbor. A similar climate of general
prosperity induced rising foreign investment, mostly British, and immigration flows, mostly
from Southern Europe. The two countries also shared similar economic structures, in that
exports were largely pastoral products. However, by this decade Argentina already had frozen
meatpacking plants in operation and had begun to move into agricultural exports, like wheat
and corn, while the frozen meatpacking industry would not arrive in Uruguay on a large scale
until the 20th century and its export basket remained almost entirely pastoral even in 1913
(AEU). Thus, while Uruguay likely enjoyed the highest exports per capita in all of Latin
America in the 1870s (Bértola and Ocampo, 2010: 98), export values did not rise during the
1880s (Bonino et al., 2015). In regard to the factors contributing to the crisis, developments in
Uruguay paralleled those in Argentina in many ways. A foreign investment boom,
accompanied by few banking restrictions, an expanding money supply and loose credit, led to,
first, the failure of the largest bank in 1890, and a year later, to government default on external
debt.
Figure 4.1 shows Argentine and Uruguayan capital inflows as a percentage of the GDP of each
country. The former received rising capital inflows from the beginning of the decade, while in
the latter, capital did not begin flowing in consistently until 1885. In Uruguay net capital
inflows reached a high point in 1890 at just over 25% of GDP. Both countries experienced a
severe fall in capital flows after the crisis, with foreign investment remaining low for the
following decade.

One major difference between Uruguay and its neighbor was the former’s strict adherence to
the gold standard. First established in 1865 when silver was demonetized, the country
experienced financial and monetary chaos in the 1860s and 1870s and suspended convertibility
several times. However, from 1876 on, it maintained convertibility of banknotes at a fixed
exchange rate until July of 1890, when convertibility was briefly suspended, setting off the
Uruguayan version of the crisis. Uruguay’s banking system was quite different from
Argentina’s in the early 1880s. The latter country had several large state-run banks –the Banco
Nacional, the BPBA and several other provincial banks–, which operated as state banks and
were in charge of note issue, and competed with private banks. Uruguay had no state bank, and
only two private banks in 1880, with a strict separation between the banking sector and the
government codified in the banking and currency Laws of 1865 and 1876, and jealously
guarded by the banks (Acevedo, 1903: 249-253; 1933b: 71-73). Attempts in the early 1880s to
found a state bank were resisted by the private banks and the merchant community, which
believed government interference in banking and note issuance would result in over issuance,
inflation and exit from the gold standard (Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 252-259). However, in
1887 the political climate had changed, and less orthodox forces achieved the establishment of
the Banco Nacional, modeled after the Argentine bank of the same name. At the same time,
several private banks entered the market, bringing the total number of banks up to twelve in
1890, although the number of banks inscribed in the Commercial Public Register was much
greater.80 The Banco Nacional, along with several of the new entrants, expanded the money
80 Nine new banks were registered in 1887, twelve in 1888 and fourteen in 1889, although it is likely that many of these never actually operated or raised much capital, and most did not survive the crisis (AEU, 1888, 1889, 1890).

supply enormously, with note issue rising fourfold between 1882 and 1889 and total liabilities
rising by a factor of six (see Appendix A for Uruguayan monetary data).
1886 saw the resignation of an unpopular dictator, and his replacement by a more moderate
and unifying figure, General Tajes, in what was seen as a return to the constitutional order. The
return to political stability inspired renewed confidence, and money began to flow (Acevedo,
1903: 261). The boom was fed in large part by British foreign investment. The government
loans floated in London in 1888 and 1889 injected capital into the economy and into the Banco
Nacional, where the government’s funds were deposited (Winn, 2010: 129-122). The promise
of external loans led to speculation on internal debt eligible for conversion. Furthermore,
foreign capital poured into various sectors, mostly railways and urban infrastructures. Three
large railway lines commenced construction in 1887 and 1888: The Central Uruguay Northern
Extension, the Central Uruguay Eastern Extension and the Midland Uruguay Railway. Banks,
tramways and telephone companies also received foreign financing (Winn, 2010: 147-151). In
addition, British investors entered heavily into livestock and agricultural endeavors (Winn,
2010: 152-159).
However, at the center of the boom was the Banco Nacional. The sale of shares was so
successful, that in 1887 they circulated at a 25% premium even before the bank began operating
officially. The bank used the money raised through the sale of shares, as well as the funds
deposited by the government, to the purchase of company shares, public debt and real estate,
as well as to promote the businesses of its directors (Winn, 2020: 100). This spending spree
caused a general frenzy of activity, leading to rising prices for public debt, stocks and land
sales.
The Uruguayan financial sector was showing signs of weakness well before the crisis. The
share price of the Banco Nacional collapsed in mid 1888 (Acevedo, 1934: 439). After
recovering, the stock market collapsed again in 1889 (Winn, 2010: 176; Acevedo, 1934: 439).
In January of 1890, the government decided to guarantee the cédulas emitted by the Banco
Nacional, as a way to bolster the floundering bank (Joslin, 1963: 135-36).81 However, note
issue, which had increased by 73% from 1887 to 1889 for the banking sector as a whole, had
increased by 280% for the Banco Nacional. This bank had gone from circulating 35% to 60%
81 Cédulas were securities hypothecated on agricultural lands. They were designed as a way for landowners to raise money on financial markets. The Argentine cédulas floated in the late 1880s circulated in London. There is no evidence that the Uruguayan version of these securities circulated internationally.

of the total note issue of the country. Due to the worrying increase in note issue, the Banco
Comercial and the Bank of London and River Plate, two of the country’s most important banks,
took to presenting notes of the Banco Nacional for conversion into gold on a daily basis (Barrán
and Nahum, 1971: 474).82
On July 5th of 1890, the government suspended convertibility of the notes of the Banco
Nacional for six months (Acevedo, 1903: 268; Joslin, 1963: 136).83 However, one week later,
the Banco Comercial, the London and River Plate, most other private banks and over 500
merchant houses signed a memorandum declaring their non-adherence to any inconvertibility
decree. All obligations would continue to be paid in gold (except those which were stipulated
in inconvertible money) and the signers would suspend transactions and withdraw credit from
anyone that did not honor debts in gold. In essence, the private banks and merchants defied the
government, continued payments in gold and demonetized the notes of the Banco Nacional. A
law passed on the 28th of the same month essentially accepted the position of the merchant
community, and added that paper currency would be accepted for payment of taxes at its market
value, and that the government could require all customs duties to be paid in gold (Acevedo,
1903: 270-71).
When convertibility of Banco Nacional notes was resumed at the beginning of July of 1891, it
did not last long. The bank was forced to suspend payments again on July 20th. This time, the
government declared a bank holiday and shut down trading on the stock market for several
weeks. The final blow to the country’s financial bubble occurred when the Uruguayan branch
of the English Bank of the River Plate closed its doors in September, setting off a run that
forced the Banco Nacional into liquidation and obliging the government to default on foreign
debt (Acevedo, 1903: 273; Winn, 2010: 194).
82 Barran and Nahúm suggest that this strategy was designed to bring down the Banco Nacional. However, this could have been merely a defensive strategy, so as not to be left holding inconvertible bills when the bank inevitably collapsed. 83 The decree suspended convertibility for six months. The Emissions Department was separated from the rest of the bank and handed over to a commission charged with using the bank's good assets in order to constitute a fund to back notes in circulation. Note issue was limited to an amount equal to the bank's capital (10,196,440 pesos) and small change issue to 2,500,000 pesos. Inconvertible notes were declared legal tender, accepted by all state offices (except for 20% of customs taxes, which had to be paid in gold in order to support the conversion fund). Inconvertible notes were also considered legal tender for private transactions. The bank had to accept inconvertible notes for service of mortgages, but had to pay cédulas in gold; all public debt, internal and external, would be paid in gold. Acevedo says the decree was from July 7th, but Nahum (2011: 20), Joslin (1963: 136) and Winn (2010: 183) refer to the announcement being made on July 5th (a Saturday).

The reforms carried out in Uruguay in response to the crisis were in many ways less drastic
than Argentina’s. In all, three banks failed during the crisis: the Banco Nacional, the English
Bank of the River Plate and the Banco Italo-Oriental. The Mortgage Department of the Banco
Nacional was spun off into an independent mortgage bank, which was nationalized in 1912,
and still exists to this day as the Banco Hipotecario del Uruguay (Bertino and Millot, 1996:
452-53). The only currency emitting banks to survive the crisis were the London and River
Plate, the Banco Italiano, and the Banco de España and Rio de la Plata. In 1896, a new state
bank was founded, the Banco de la República Oriental del Uruguay. It was to operate as a
commercial bank, a state bank and development bank, and eventually gained a monopoly on
currency issue in 1907, as the permission to emit notes was not renewed for private banks when
their charters lapsed.84 Just as in Argentina, the Uruguayan state reformed its revenue structure,
raising internal taxes in an effort to reduce dependence on import tariffs (Bertino and Millot,
1996: 365). The government’s debts were renegotiated, lowering the nominal interest rate paid
on external loans and the guarantee rate for railway subsidies to 3.5%.
4.3 Argentina and Uruguay: banking and the money supply
This section compares the Argentine and Uruguayan money supply and banking sector
liquidity, in order to study the relationship between prices, exchange rates and gold standard
adherence in the lead up to the crisis. Figure 4.2 shows the evolution of bank created money
(notes in circulation in yellow and deposits in blue, the sum of which equals total liabilities of
the banking sector) in absolute terms for Argentina and Uruguay. In both countries, note issue
increased by a factor of four between 1883 and 1889. However, total liabilities rose more for
Uruguay over the same period, by a factor of almost six, while for Argentina they rose by
around four. To put this increase into greater perspective, notes in circulation for both countries
rose from under 10% of GDP at the beginning of the decade, to around 20% by 1890. Total
liabilities, which were around 20% of GDP for both countries in the early 1880s, rose to 70%
of GDP by 1889 for Uruguay, whereas in Argentina this ratio peaked at just over 40% in the
same year.
84 This occurred in 1904 for the London and River Plate and in 1907 for the Banco Italiano. The Banco de España and Río de la Plata had stopped issuing paper notes after an initial emission in 1888, although its notes still circulated for years after (from bank balances, AEU).

Figure 4.2: Argentina and Uruguay, bank reserves and bank created money, 1883-1899
Sources: For Argentina, notes in circulation and deposits are from Ferreres (2005), and specie in banks is from della Paolera and Taylor (2001: 53). For Uruguay, see Appendix A.
Specie reserves in banks (orange, dashed line) are also shown. In Uruguay, the increase in
specie reserves in banks allowed the reserve to liabilities ratio of the banking sector to remain
relatively high, around 0.5 in the mid 1880s, falling to 0.23 in 1890. Since notes in circulation
made up less than half of liabilities, the note stock was essentially fully backed by gold at all
times for the sector as a whole (but not for some individual banks). In Argentina, the reserve
to liabilities ratio was always low, around 0.1 in the mid-1880s, and falling to 0.02 by 1890.85
Notes were backed by reserves at around 30% in the mid-1880s, and only 4% in 1890.
What was the effect of this monetary expansion on exchange rates and prices? Argentina, with
an inconvertible currency from 1885 on, saw its paper currency depreciate relative to gold.
While it had remained relatively firm until 1884, the exchange rate jumped by almost 40% in
1885, and after remaining relatively stable for a few years, began rising precipitously in 1888,
reaching almost 4 times its 1884 level by 1891. Uruguay, on the other hand, maintained a fixed
exchange rate of 4.7 pesos per pound throughout the period, except during a brief period after
July of 1890. These movements can be seen in Figure 4.3.
85 The data from della Paolera (1988) break down notes in circulation into notes in hands of the public and notes held by banks, or “vault cash”. Here, we have used total notes in circulation to calculate the money supply, in order to maintain comparability with the Uruguayan statistics, which do not allow the same level of discrimination. If we remove vault cash from the banking sector liabilities and include it in banking sector reserves, the reserve ratio would be around 0.2 in the mid-1880s, falling to 0.16 in 1890. In other words, it would be somewhat closer to the calculated ratio for Uruguay. However, if we could know the amount of note circulation that was held by banks for Uruguay, recalculating the reserve ratio would also likely give higher results.

The 1880s were a time of world price deflation, as proxied by the British price index (Figure
4.4). Argentine prices fell during its years on the gold standard (1883 and 1884), and rose only
slightly in the years immediately after gold was abandoned. However, they began rising
precipitously in 1888, increasing almost fivefold up to 1891. Uruguayan prices, while stable in
the early part of the 1880s, fell from 1885 to 1887 by over twice as much as British prices.
They rose sharply in 1889, and then fell thereafter until 1893.
The monetary figures presented above show essentially an equivalent proportional increase in
bank money for both countries, although it is higher for Uruguay in relation to GDP. The main
difference appears to be the reserve ratio, which was higher for Uruguay and likely was
important for the country’s ability to maintain the gold standard. However, how can we explain
the completely different trajectories of prices, especially in light of the fact that bank money
growth was higher in Uruguay relative to GDP?

Obviously, bank created money does not tell the whole story. Gold also made up an important
part of the money supply in many countries during the late 19th century, although the proportion
of gold to other money could vary. For example, Portugal, a country that was on the gold
standard from 1854 to 1890, had almost no note circulation, and deposits made up less than
one third of the money supply. The rest was gold, which circulated in the form of coins (Reis,
2000: 71, 85). In other countries, like the Philippines, which operated a gold exchange standard
from 1905 to 1910, no gold circulated in the country and gold reserves were held at a bank in
New York (Kemmerer, 1944: 153-61). Gold, and to a limited extent other metals, circulated
freely along-side banknotes in both Argentina and Uruguay. The public could choose to hold
specie as a medium of exchange that competed with paper currency or for hoarding purposes.86
Under the Gold standard, specie was also used to back paper note issue. Thus, changes in a
country’s gold stocks, and their distribution between the banking system and the public, were
a major determinant of changes in the money supply.
Consequently, in order to get a sense of changes in the total money supply, estimates of specie
stocks are needed. For countries like Argentina and Uruguay, which produced little or no
precious metals, specie stocks were determined by the balance of payments. Argentina minted
gold coins, while in Uruguay only silver, copper and nickel coins were minted, to a limited
extent, for low value transactional purposes. In both countries, foreign coins circulated freely.
For Argentina, Della Paolera and Taylor (2001: 53) present estimates of total gold stocks based
on the export and import of monetary gold (coins and bullion), taken from official statistics of
the customs house (they claim circulation of silver coins was negligible). They use an estimate
of the stock of gold in the country in 1881, valued at 3,000,000 gold pesos, and adjust the level
of stocks year-by-year according to net gold flows. Data on gold held by the main banks is
available from their balances and official publications, and the gold in the hands of the public
is obtained as a residual.
For Uruguay, similar data on gold flows is available based on customs house records from
1878 to 1907.87 There are few estimates of specie stocks for the period. In his message to the
86 Gold hoarding was common in peripheral economies during the period. In Portugal, for example, gold rose from about 80% to about 90% of the M1 money supply from 1865 to 1890, a period in which the rest of Europe was moving towards greater use of bank money, suggesting residents were hoarding gold for non-transactional reasons (Reis, 2000: 84-86). Gold was hoarded for speculative reasons, as a hedge against paper currency depreciation, or due to lack of confidence in the banking system. 87 In general, data on gold flows from customs house records is notoriously unreliable. For example, for Spain, Prados de la Escosura (2009: 16) prefers to interpolate between direct estimates of the gold stock rather than rely on customs house reports, since he claims they do not capture all flows due to smuggling. Bazot, Bordo and


100
Congress in 1891, Julio Herrera y Obes, the country’s President, claimed a metallic stock of
13 or 14 million pesos, or around 3,000,000 pounds (Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 477). This is
far too low since it would make total specie stocks lower than reserves in the banking system
for the years leading up to the Crisis. Acevedo (1933b: 458) presents and estimate for 1896 of
about 7,300,000 pounds worth of gold, to which must be added about 1,000,000 in silver and
nickel coins (these made up on average around 10% of the specie stock throughout the
period).88 The result is a specie stock valued at about 8,500,000 pounds for Uruguay in 1896.89
Acevedo (1934b) also presents an estimate of total specie stock for 1906 of 10,000,000 pounds,
based on “the most current commercial information” and an estimate for 1908 of about
9,500,000 pounds. Extrapolating the 1896 figure by net specie flows leads to an overshoot of
the specie stock estimates for 1906 and 1908 of more than 4,000,000 pounds (likewise, taking
the 1906 figure as the base leads to a specie stock for 1896 far below Acevedo’s estimate for
that year). Here, I have taken the halfway point, taking 75% of the 1896 estimate as the base
year from which to extrapolate the net gold import data, leading to a specie stock in 1896 about
2,000,000 below Acevedo’s estimate for that year, and for 1906 a specie stock above the
estimate in that year by the same amount.90 Figure 4.5 shows the estimates of specie stocks for
Argentina and Uruguay from 1877 to 1899.
Monnet (2016: 91) suggest the same for France, due to the omission of important flows, especially from coins brought by travelers, although they use this data in spite of its unreliability. In regard to the Uruguayan statistics, Acevedo (1934a: 41) states that the data on monetary specie was “deficient, due to a lack of efficient auditing of the declarations made by the commanders of ships”. However, the Argentine historiography has always relied on customs house records for estimating gold flows, and neither Williams (1920), Ford (1962) or Della Paolera and Taylor (2001) question their reliability. Reis (2000) uses this type of data as well, for Portugal. Here, I have used the Uruguayan customs house data, for lack of a better source, since it is likely as reliable as the data used by the Argentine economic historiography. 88 Calculated from the sum of all coins minted since the 1870s. 1,000,000 pesos in silver coins were minted in 1877, 2,000,000 in 1893 and another 1,000,000 in 1895. 500,000 pesos in nickel coins were minted in 1901, and an equivalent sum again in 1909 (BROU, 1918: 274-84). 89 In that year, complaints about the circulation of worn gold coins from Chile, called condors, led to the banks purchasing them at weight and exporting them to Europe in the form of gold bars. Between the months of April and May of that year, 420,997.5 condors (worth 3,713,198 pesos) were exported. According to Acevedo, this revealed a surprisingly high number of condors, more than double what was thought to be in circulation. The author applies this same ratio to estimates of all other circulating coins, and concludes that the gold in circulation was far larger than what was held by banks as reserves. 90 The level of the base year makes a large difference in terms of the percent of specie held by the public versus held by banks. However, the general direction of trends in the composition of the money supply is not affected by this choice.

Figure 4.5: Argentina and Uruguay, specie stocks, 1877-1899
Sources: For Argentina, della Paolera and Taylor (2001: 53). For Uruguay, gold flows from AEU and initial gold stock is own estimation based on Acevedo (1934b).
The first thing one notices about this figure is that in the early 1880s it appears that Uruguayan
specie stocks were almost 50% higher than Argentina’s. The latter country’s GDP at that time
was about 6 times that of Uruguay’s. Can these specie stock figures be believed? There are
some reasons to think so. First, Argentina’s long history with paper currency –metallic backed
notes being first circulated in 1822– meant there was historically less need for specie and that
the public was accustomed to conducting business with paper currency. Ford (1962: 94) notes
that Argentina’s “specie reserves were slender”. An 1881 law designed to create monetary
order allowed for the minting of gold and silver coins. However, observers decried that the
coins were shipped overseas, since none were detected in circulation a few years after minting
(Williams, 1920: 34). Uruguay, on the other hand, had scant experience with banking and paper
currency. The first banks were founded in 1857 and the country’s merchant class was
accustomed to operating in gold or bills of exchange denominated in foreign currencies
(Acevedo, 1933b; Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 441). In the 1891 message from Julio Herrera y
Obes cited above, he mentions the Uruguayan public’s “repulsion” towards fiduciary money
and that almost all transactions occurred in gold (Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 477). Second, the
figures presented by Della Paolera and Taylor are perhaps somewhat of an underestimate, since
it is known metal, especially silver coins from neighboring countries, circulated widely in the
interior of the country (Williams, 1920: 31-31; Irigoin, 2000: 343) and the authors explicitly
neglect silver in their estimates.
The other striking thing about Figure 4.5 is the different trajectories of the specie stocks of the
two countries. Argentine stocks rose dramatically from 1885 to 1888. They fell sharply in 1889,
before continuing their upward trajectory until the end of the century. In Uruguay, specie stocks
were stable in the early 1880s, but fell in the second half of the decade. This process reverted

after the 1890 crisis, with stocks almost doubling by 1899. What explains these divergent
trajectories in the 1880s?
We have already seen that both countries had similar levels of capital inflows relative to GDP.
Figure 4.6 shows exports and imports for the two countries.91 Argentina experienced strong
export growth from 1880 to 1899, with export values rising from around 13,000,000 to
42,000,000 pounds over the period. In these years Argentina not only moved into higher value
pastoral products, like frozen beef (the first meatpacking plant was installed in 1882), but also
incorporated agricultural products like wheat and corn into its export basket (Rapoport, 2000:
74-76). Uruguayan exports, around 7,500,000 pounds in 1880, did not increase in value over
the next decades. Uruguay did not experience the same productive transformation that
Argentina did. In 1890 more than 90% of exports came from the livestock sector, while
agricultural products represented only 4%. In 1913 these proportions were basically unchanged
(AEU, 1913/14). As for imports, they rose in both countries over the course of the 1880s, and
collapsed after 1889.
Both countries experienced widening deficits in their merchandise trade balance beginning in
the mid-1880s. In Argentina, strong export growth meant the gap did not appear until 1887,
and did not grow to extreme proportions. Import expenditures were never more than 50%
higher than export revenues. In Uruguay, export values did not increase over the period, due to
falling prices, the closing of markets for salted beef and the failure to diversify into export
agriculture.92 Merchandise trade deficits appeared in 1884, with imports values increasing to
twice the level of exports by 1889. As mentioned in chapter 3, there may be large biases in the
Uruguayan trade series, especially for imports.93
91 Argentine trade statistics suffer from the same problem as the Uruguayan trade statistics mentioned in chapter 2. For the period under study, both countries recorded merchandise trade statistics at officially quoted prices (valores de aforo), which were changed only occasionally, and did not reflect current market prices. As with Uruguay, there are corrected series for Argentina. Federico and Tena (2019) presents corrected series for exports and imports at current prices, which apply prices at foreign ports to Argentine export volumes, and uses price indices to deflate import volumes. For further discussion of the problem with Argentine trade statistics see Rayes (2014) and Tena-Junguito and Willebald (2013). 92 As mentioned in Chapter 3, the fixed exchange rate may have also played a role in the country’s poor export performance. Argentina had falling costs in gold, due to its depreciating paper currency, helping it become competitive as a grain exporter. Uruguay did not have this advantage, which may partly explain its difficulty in diversifying out of livestock products. 93 Despite the possible biases in the import series, it is clear that import values rose significantly in Uruguay at the end of the 1880s. This was partly due to the impact of the fixed exchange rate. If the country had had a floating exchange rate, like Argentina, imports may have increased less, since the currency would likely have been depreciating and thus the peso cost of imports would have been rising, reducing the quantity demanded.

The services and unilateral transfers balances were most likely negative for both countries,94
meaning they would have had large current account deficits in that decade. However,
Uruguay’s current account deficits were likely proportionally larger than Argentina’s, in large
part due to its poor export growth. This led to gold drains for Uruguay during the investment
boom at the end of the decade, when imports rose dramatically, caused in large part by the
direct and indirect effects of foreign investment (purchases of capital goods for building
infrastructures and consumption goods related to rising incomes). Argentina’s enormous
capital inflows equaled or surpassed the negative current account in most years, leading to
relative stability of gold stocks from 1883 to 1885 and 1887, and large gold inflows in 1886
and 1888.
Part of specie stocks circulated among the public, either as means of payment or for hoarding
purposes. The other part was held by banks as backing for note issue and deposits. Figure 4.7
shows the estimated proportion of specie reserves in the hands of the public versus that held as
bank reserves for both countries.
94 The major components would have been dividends and interest on foreign investment and immigrant remittances. Other items, also negative and of lesser importance, would have included freight costs for imports (since neither country had a merchant navy working outside of the Uruguay river), tourism and overseas consular services. For an estimate of the services and unilateral transfers balances for Uruguay, see Chapter 2.

Figure 4.7: Argentina and Uruguay, estimated proportion of specie reserves held by the public, 1883-1899
Sources: For Argentina, della Paolera and Taylor (2001: 53). For Uruguay, own estimation based on reserves in banks from Appendix A and specie stocks from figure 4.5.
Here we see one of the impacts of the differing exchange rate policy in the two countries. For
Argentina in the early 1880s, the greater part of the (low) specie stock of the country was held
as reserves in banks, with the public holding only around 10% of monetary gold. However,
after inconvertibility was declared in 1885 and the exchange rate of paper pesos to gold began
rising, preference on the part of the public for holding gold began to rise. By 1890, on the eve
of the crisis, over 80% of the country’s gold stock were in the hands of the public.
For most of the 1880s, the opposite occurred in Uruguay. In 1883 the public held around 90%
of the country’s specie stocks. However, throughout the boom years, as the banking sector
expanded and confidence in banks grew, a greater proportion of the specie stocks ended up in
banks vaults, reaching a peak of over 80% in 1889. After the 1890 crisis and temporary
suspension of the gold standard, the public’s preference for gold rose, but this increase halted
in 1892 after the resolution of the crisis and resumption of debt payments on the part of the
government.
What this information on gold allocation reveals is that despite the fact that bank money
increased faster in Uruguay before 1890, the total money supply rose much more in Argentina.
Figure 4.8 shows the money supply of both countries, and its composition in three categories:
specie in the hands of the public, notes in circulation and deposits. In Argentina, the money
supply increased by almost five times between 1883 and 1889. In Uruguay, the increase over
the same period was much lower, the money supply rising by around 50%. The reason for this
is the massive reduction in specie in the hands of the public, which fell by 92%, and had two
causes: the reduction in overall specie stocks due to gold outflows and the transfer of gold to
the banking sector. Thus, the overall increase in the Uruguayan money supply over the same
period was just 64%.

Figure 4.8: Argentina and Uruguay, money supply, 1883-1899
Sources: For Argentina: della Paolera and Taylor (2001); for Uruguay, see Appendix A.
Despite the massive increase in liabilities in Uruguay (even greater, proportionally, than the
increase in Argentina), monetary matters were more stable than its neighbor’s, for two reasons.
First, reserve ratios remained high throughout the 1880s and, second, the increase in the money
supply, which started in earnest only in 1887, was much lower than in Argentina. This explains
in large part how Uruguay was able to maintain a fixed exchange rate up to 1890.
Why did Uruguay’s exchange rate peg eventually break? Ultimately, monetary imprudence on
the part of two major banks caught up with them. The specie reserve to liabilities ratio fell from
around 0.5 in 1885 to 0.27 in 1891 for the banking sector as a whole (Figure 4.9). However,
many banks maintained high reserve ratios during this period. For the Banco Comercial, the
oldest bank in operation, the ratio dropped to 0.21 in 1888, but this was due to it giving up the
right of note emission the year before and the consequent gold drain from clients turning in the
bank’s note circulation. In the years prior to this, it had ratios of around 0.5 or 0.6, and during
the crisis years, this bank held reserves equaling over 80% of its deposits. The reserve ratio of
London and River Plate, the second oldest bank in operation, never dropped below 0.38, while
the Banco Italiano, founded in 1887, maintained a reserve ratio above 0.3 in all years. However,
the English Bank of the River Plate, a British Bank that began operations in 1886, with an
ambitious plan for capturing market share, began losing reserves in 1889, as its liabilities rose,
and ended up closing its doors in October of 1891 (Winn, 2010: 194).95 By 1890 its reserves
had dipped to 13% of liabilities. However, the main culprit was the Banco Nacional. This bank
had 34% of the banking sector’s liabilities in 1889, and 24% of specie reserves. However, the
following year, after its collapse was forestalled by the temporary suspension of note
95 This was the only bank to continue accepting the notes of the Banco Nacional after the inconvertibility decree of July of 1890 (Morató, 1926: 30).

The Banco Nacional was founded in 1887, brainchild of the Spanish entrepreneur Emilio Reus
and a cadre of Anglo-Argentine capitalists (Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 464). The project was
supported by industrialists, the urban middle class and owners of small and medium sized rural
landholdings (Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 453-56). The bank was to have a capital of 10 million
pesos (more than six times the capital of any other bank in operation that year) and would
venture into activities which until that moment had been underserved by the banking
community. It could emit paper currency up to two times its capital and was obligated to
maintain a 25% specie reserve (a limit that was not respected). It also was to have a monopoly
on the emission of small bills, with a limit of 40% of its capital. It would be divided into a
commercial department and a mortgage department, the latter being able to make secured loans
for up to 30 years and to emit “cédulas”, a financial instrument designed to facilitate land
investments. A network of branches in every department was to be established. The Director
of the bank was to be appointed by the government. In addition, the bank would run a current
account for the government of up to 1.5 million pesos and handle public debt service at home
and abroad (Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 465).
The purpose of this bank was to extend credit to customers that had thus far been shut out, and
at rates that would promote the productive use of the country’s resources. When its first efforts
did not pan out, due to the cédulas circulating at only 75% of their par value, the state decided
to subsidize credit, guaranteeing loans made by the bank. Nevertheless, most of the mortgage
department’s resources went into urban property and the stock market, fueling rising prices and
speculation, while relief for the credit starved countryside, and especially for small landholders,
was limited (Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 466-67). However, the main problem was the bank’s


107
close ties to the government. Uruguay’s president, Herrera y Obes, and the financiers that
controlled a web of speculative investments, decided to use the bank’s resources to inflate a
bubble. For the investors, the purpose was to maintain various lucrative speculative bets until
they could be profitably unloaded. For the government, the short-term objective was to finance
growing deficits, while in the long term it was to promote investment and immigration that
could eventually generate export revenues in large enough volume to meet the country’s debt
burden (Winn, 2010: 174-177). Thus, just as in Argentina, one of the key weaknesses in the
Uruguayan financial structure was intimately related to the government’s fiscal position and
public debt.
4.4 The exchange rate, foreign debt and the fiscal situation
Argentina’s floating exchange rate had major consequences for the relation between fiscal
revenues and payments on external debt;96 the former was denominated in depreciating paper
currency, while the latter was fixed in gold.97 As the Argentine paper peso depreciated, the
government’s ability to pay loan interest eroded. According to Cortés Conde (1989: 177), the
amount of paper pesos necessary to cover external loan service was increased by 45% in 1889
and 29% in 1890 due to the rising gold premium.98 The additional amount spent in 1889 made
up about 10% of the deficit that year. Both Cortés Conde and Williams (1920: 97), presents
similar figures, highlight paper peso depreciation as one of the main causes of the government’s
worsening fiscal position.
The fixed exchange rate in Uruguay allowed the government of that country to avoid this
problem. External debt was paid in gold, as were internal debt and other spending by the state.
However, taxes were collected in gold as well.99 Unfortunately, it is difficult to say anything
concrete about the fiscal situation in Uruguay due to the fact that government accounts do not
96 Most of Argentina’s debt was payable in gold, since much of the internal debts had been externalized through a series of conversion loans. Additionally, Williams (1920: 94) claims 90% of existing internal debt was held abroad in the late 1880s, and therefore payable in gold. Cortés Conde (1989: 181) also suggest that part of Argentine internal debt was held by foreigners. 97 In the past episodes of inconvertibility of notes, the government had continued operating in a gold denominated unit of account for tax collection and payment of salaries and other costs. However, since 1885, the government had maintained its accounts in paper pesos. 98 Calculated as the amount paid for debt service, plus the “exchange difference” (diferencia de cambios), divided by the amount paid for debt service. 99 Only for the approximately three weeks from July 5th to 28th, 1890, did the government receive tax payments in depreciated paper currency at its face value. After this period, it received the depreciated notes of the Banco Nacional at their market value, meaning revenues were still charged in gold.


108
show believable results.100 For the 1880s, government revenues are available from the AEU,
in which the government published summaries of its accounts. Expenditures are available from
the published budgets, and reflect planned, not actual, spending. The problem is that when the
two are combined, deficits appear in only three out of the ten years up to 1890. Other years
show surpluses, sometimes quite large. This cannot be correct, as public debt grew by 68%
between 1880 and 1889. Furthermore, deficits are discussed repeatedly in the messages of the
Executive branch, and appear in the accounts of the Finance ministry examined by Eduardo
Acevedo (1934a: 217-232, 323, 442, 565).101 There were evidently large sums spent that
weren’t budgeted for and for which records are missing.
This also makes difficult an evaluation of the weight of debt service in government budgets;
thus, the figures offered below should be interpreted with caution. Interest and amortization on
public debt is available from the AEU beginning in 1892. For earlier years, the rate paid for
external debt102 service (interest and amortization divided by the stock of debt in each year)
has been applied to internal debt, to calculate the service paid on all public debt.103 Railway
guarantee payments have also been included, since they were an important obligation,
amounting on average to 4% of government revenues between 1870 and 1913 (Díaz, 2017:
288). For Argentina, the government expenditure data is from Della Paolera and Taylor (2001:
90) and the debt service figures, inclusive of railway guarantees, from Ferreres (2005), and is
all in paper pesos.104
Figure 4.9 shows public debt service (DS) as a percentage of government revenues for
Argentina and Uruguay from 1885 to 1893. Due to the rough nature of the figures, a year-to
100 It is important to note that the use of official prices (valores de aforo) by both Uruguay and Argentina would have had a stabilizing effect on government revenues. For both countries, most government revenues were derived from import tariffs (Bertino and Millot, 1996: 366; della Paolera and Taylor, 2001: 81). Falling import prices would have caused government revenues to decline. However, since the official prices were modified only occasionally, both countries generally avoided losing revenue in this situation. The effect of this type of tariff is discussed in Bértola and Williamson (2003). 101 Acevedo offers several, conflicting figures for some years of the 1880s. 102 External debt refers to Uruguayan debt held abroad. Much debt denominated as “external” was in fact held by Uruguayan residents, mostly due to the various bond conversions in which external debt was swapped for previously held internal debt. See appendix A for the exact method of estimation of external debt. 103 Internal debt generally had higher effective interest rates, which was the main motive for the government to contract debt abroad. However, the nominal interest rates were generally the same or lower than that on external debt, since internal debt usually sold at steep discounts. For example, in 1889, four of the five circulating internal series carried a service of 6% between interest and amortization, while the two external series had a service of 5.5% and 7% (AEU, 1889). 104 Della Paolera and Taylor’s fiscal data is for the federal government, inclusive of debt service. Ferreres data is also for the federal government, and matches closely with Williams (1920: 101) figures for the federal government for 1886-1890.


109
year analysis must be taken with caution. In general, debt service was around 30% to 40% of
government revenues for both countries in the mid 1880s. However, from 1889 to 1891, this
measure diverges. For Argentina, debt service rose to 60% of government revenues, while for
Uruguay it remained steady around 30%, and fell to 20% in 1891 when Uruguay failed to make
interest payments in the second half of the year. After the crisis, debt service was about 30%
of revenues for Argentina and close to 40% for Uruguay.
Figure 4.9: Argentina and Uruguay, debt service as a percent of government revenues, 1885 - 1893
Source: For Argentina, own estimation based on della Paolera and Taylor (2001) and Ferreres (2005); For Uruguay, see text.
Uruguay not only defaulted on its public debt in 1891, it failed to pay the full share of railway
guarantees throughout the 1880s (Díaz, 2017: 288). The dotted line shows what debt service
as a percent of revenues would have been if Uruguay had paid full railway guarantees and
interest on public debt in 1891. In this counterfactual situation, debt service as a percent of
revenues reaches 46%. Still, Argentina’s debt service grew faster, almost tripling between 1885
and 1891, while Uruguay’ counterfactual debt services increased by less than a factor of two.
For Argentina, debt service weighed much more heavily in government revenues than it did
for Uruguay. It appears that Uruguay’s choice of fixed exchange rates protected the
government from one of the negative effects of currency depreciation. However, while it
avoided defaulting at the same time Argentina did in 1890, Uruguay could not avoid
succumbing to the same fate a year later, defaulting on its external debt in the second half of
1891.
4.5 Financial links between Uruguay and Argentina
There is evidence of large capital flows between Uruguay and Argentina during the 1880s. For

from appreciating by selling the gold held by the Banco Nacional, large shipments of gold left
the country. Cortés Conde (1989: 220) cites documentation from the London and River Plate
bank which mentions these gold shipments, and that a large part of them went to Uruguay.
These gold movements also appear in the Uruguayan statistics, which break down specie flows
by region, and show large inflows from Argentina in the 1880s (Figure 4.10).
Figure 4.10: Net specie inflows from Argentina to Uruguay, 1878-1907
Source: AEU
Net specie flows from Argentina to Uruguay were consistently positive from 1883 to 1889,
reaching over 500,000 pounds per year from 1886 to 1888. However, by 1890, they had become
negative, as the situation in Uruguay became dire, prompting Argentines to pull out their capital
(Winn, 2010: 182). From 1883 to 1890, Argentina increased its specie stock by 6,300,000
pounds, or, by a factor of 2.4. Over the same period, Uruguay lost almost 2,600,000 pounds,
or 38%, of its metallic stock. Why would gold flow from Argentina to Uruguay, when the
former was receiving it from overseas and the latter was exporting it to the rest of the world?
Overall gold flows to each country were determined by the sign of the balance of payments,
which was itself largely influenced by the balance of merchandise trade. As we have seen, the
size of capital inflows relative to GDP was similar in both countries. In Argentina, the overall
debt burden from foreign borrowings weighed heavily in the balance of payments, making the
current account more negative (Williams, 1920: 45, 101). Since Uruguay’s foreign borrowings
were in line with Argentina’s relative to the economy, interest and dividends payments would
likely have weighed similarly. As seen in the last section, the evidence shows this was true for
public debt. Immigrant remittances would have been another important, negative item, in both
countries.

The main difference was in the relation between imports and exports. As discussed earlier,
Uruguay’s merchandise trade balance grew much wider than Argentina’s in the 1880s (Figure
4.6, above). We mentioned how Argentina was able to increase export values, in large part by
diversifying out of traditional sectors, into higher value livestock products and into export
agriculture, while Uruguay failed to modify its economic structure. In Argentina, export values
grew by 44% from 1883 to 1889, while in Uruguay they fell by 5%. The other factor was
imports, which doubled for Argentina from 1883 to 1889, but grew by a factor of 2.6 in
Uruguay over the same period. This, in relation to capital inflows from Europe, is what
determined the sign of the balance of payments and direction of overall net gold flows to each
country.
Long term capital flows between Argentina and Uruguay were likely insignificant. Neither
country participated in major overseas investment in the 1880s (Rapoport, 2005; Jacob, 2011).
Trade between the two countries was also relatively balanced in the decade, with the surpluses
in favor of Uruguay in 1883, 1887 and 1888, and deficit in other years, which were on average
not higher than 60,000 pounds and rarely reaching more than 100,000 pounds in any given year
(AEU). Gold flows likely went into short term or speculative investments: bank deposits,
discounting bills, purchase of company shares or public debt on the stock market and real estate
(Morató, 1926: 28). There are three possible explanations for these sustained gold flows.
Argentine capital could have been pursuing higher returns, if short-term interest rates were
higher in Uruguay. Alternatively, speculative investment opportunities could have drawn
capital east, due to the possibility of earning capital gains from rising stock and real estate
prices. A third possibility is that capital was seeking safety in Uruguay’s banking system, which
was seen as stronger than Argentina’s.105
Information on short term interest rates for this period is scarce. Average deposit and loan
interest rates for the Argentine and Uruguayan businesses of the London and River Plate can
105 A fourth possibility has to do with the illicit transit trade, known in Uruguay as the “comercio de tránsito”, which involved smuggling imported European manufactures into Argentina from Uruguay. Gold inflows could represent payment for these goods. This trade existed since at least the 1860s, and slowly waned over the course of the 19th century (Mourat, 1971). It is possible that this trade increased during the rise in Argentine imports during the 1880s, which coincides roughly with the consistent gold inflows from Argentina to Uruguay between 1883 and 1889. The trade balance between the two countries was neutral, while total annual exports from Uruguay to Argentina were around 100,000 pounds in the mid 1880s, rising to around 250,000 pounds in the last years of the decade. If gold flows from Argentina were in payment for transit goods, it means the unregistered trade would have had to have been about four times registered exports. Without further information, it is impossible to evaluate whether this magnitude is believable. Further research is needed to establish the possible link between transit trade and gold flows between the two countries.

be calculated from bank balance sheets.106 For Argentina, the sources are in gold terms; that is,
paper denominated deposits, credits, interest payments and interest charges, are valued at par,
regardless of whether the underlying asset or liability was in paper or gold. Paper deposits
interest represented around 20% of total deposits interest from 1885 to 1890, dropping to
around 10% in 1891 and 1892 (Lloyds, BOLSA/F/2/1/b/5.1).107 Loans were mostly in paper, a
policy the bank had been implementing since 1885 to avoid a situation in which gold loans
would be repaid in inconvertible paper currency (Joslin, 1963: 124). Paper loan interest
represented about 75% to 90% of total loan interest from 1885 to 1890, falling to 56% in 1892.
These are shown in figures 3.11 and 3.12, along with the Uruguayan market discount rate.

106 Deposits and loans have been estimated from the asset and liabilities balance, while interest paid on deposits and charged for loans comes from the profit and loss account. The asset and liabilities balance for Argentina is not available. The balances for the whole organization are available (Lloyds, BOLSA/F/2/1/b/5.2), as are the ones for the Montevideo branch (AEU, 1919), and the deposits and loans of the Montevideo branch have been subtracted from the total to get the Argentine figures, since the only other main branches operating at that time were the Buenos Aires and Rosario branches (there was a very small branch in Paris, opened in 1884, and the head office in London, which maintained very low levels of deposits, Joslin, 1963: 124). The profit and loss accounts are available for Buenos Aires (UCL, BOLSA/D/120) and Montevideo (UCL, BOLSA/D/115). These show deposit interest, on the spending side, and income from discounts and general loan interest on the revenue side. In order to get an estimate of total deposit and loan interest for Argentina, the Buenos Aires figures have been augmented by and estimate for the Rosario Branch. This is based on the ratio of gross profits from that branch to the Buenos Aires branch, and assumes deposit and loan interest maintains the same ratio. Gross profits for both Argentine branches are available in the profit and loss accounts from 1885 to 1889. For 1890 to 1892, the average of the ratio for earlier years is used. The head office accounts are recorded in pounds sterling, the Uruguayan branch accounts are in Uruguayan pesos and the Argentine profit and loss accounts record sterling totals, but also break this down into paper pesos and gold pesos. 107 The sources do not permit discriminating between paper and gold deposits, nor do they break down loans into paper and gold.

In Argentina, average deposit rates were around 1.2% in 1885, rising to 2% from 1887 to 1889,
and reaching 3% in 1890. In Uruguay they were 1.5% or less in the 1880s, rising to 2.4% by
1891. Loan rates were generally higher in Uruguay, averaging 7% in the mid-1880s and rising
to over 10% for the LRP, and just under 10% for the market discount rate, during the crisis. In
Argentina they were around 4% in the mid-1880s, increasing to 8% in 1890.108 Lack of
competition and the dominance of the Montevideo branch of the LRP in Uruguay likely explain
why it could pay less for deposits and charge more for loans than the branches in neighboring
Argentina, which had to contend with more competitors, especially the large Banco Nacional
and BPBA.
However, as we saw in section 3.3, domestic prices changed substantially over the period in
both countries, and sometimes in different directions. It is the differences in real interest rates
that would have provided incentives to move gold from one country to another. The price index
for Argentina presented in Figure 4.4 is for paper pesos, while the interest rates presented here
are averages for liabilities and assets that are denominated in both paper and gold. It is thus
necessary to know gold price inflation, which can be obtained by adjusting paper price inflation
by the Argentine exchange rate (gold premium), and is shown in table 3.2. As can be seen, gold
prices in Argentina did not begin rising until 1890, and in fact fell in most years from 1885 to
1889, because up until that point the exchange rate generally appreciated faster than paper
prices rose.
108 Joslin (1963: 124) comments that during the boom years “interest rates on good bills were running from 10 to 12 per cent”, although it is not clear if he is referring to Argentina or Uruguay.

109 The proportion of paper and gold interest income has been used in lieu of information on the actual proportions of paper and gold deposits and loans, which is not available. The biases that can be introduced into the series are small relative to the changes in prices, both in paper and gold, and thus would likely not change the conclusions.


115
Before 1890, real interest deposit rates were higher in Uruguay only in 1886 and 1887. Loan
rates were higher from 1885 to 1887. In 1888 and 1889, real deposit and loan rates were higher
in Argentina than in Uruguay. In 1890 and 1891, real rates in Argentina were highly negative,
as inflation in both paper and gold prices accelerated. In Uruguay, real rates were high, as
severe deflation set in. Since gold flows from Argentina to Uruguay were accelerating from
1885 to 1888, and still high in 1889, but then reversed direction after this year, real interest
rates do not appear to be a driving factor.
There are claims in the literature that gold flowed from Argentina to Uruguay for speculative
investments. For example, in 1887 the director of the Buenos Aires Branch of the London and
River Plate Bank commented on the effects of Argentine capital being invested in the newly
established Uruguayan Banco Nacional (Joslin, 1963: 121). Gold also flowed east due to the
Argentine government’s intervention in the gold market in 1889 in an attempt to keep the
exchange rate from appreciating. However, by all accounts, Uruguay’s speculative boom began
in earnest in 1887 (Acevedo, 1934a: 438-39; Winn, 2010). For example, the value of land sales
in Uruguay (Figure 4.13),110 after falling around 30% from 1885 to 1886, rose between 30%
and 40% each year from 1886 to 1889. Sales collapsed in 1890, falling 50%, and continued a
downward trend in the following years. Despite this, net gold inflows from Argentina were
positive beginning in 1883 (around 200,000 pounds per year) and rising after 1884.
Figure 4.13: value of land sales in Uruguay, 1885-1893
Source: Acevedo (1934a: 414, 519)
If seeking higher returns or speculative investments alone can’t explain gold inflows from
Argentina, especially before 1887, it is likely that capital moved east in part due to the
Uruguay’s adherence to the gold standard and the confidence in the country’s banking system
which upheld it. Figure 4.14 shows the ratio of reserves to notes of the banking sector for both

countries, while Figure 4.15 shows the ratio of reserves to total liabilities. For both measures,
the Uruguayan banking system was much more secure. Reserves were around 125% of notes
from 1884 onwards, while they were always above 20% of liabilities. For Argentina, reserves
covered around 30% of notes until 1888, but fell precipitously afterwards. Liabilities were
covered at around 10% until 1888, and also fell in subsequent years as the banking sector lost
gold.

What was the impact of gold flows from Argentina to Uruguay? Figure 4.16 shows specie
flows to Uruguay from 1880 to 1899. Total specie flows are shown in the thick, blue line. These
were negative from 1884 to 1889, reaching 500,000-pound outflow in 1887 and almost
1,000,000 pounds in 1889. The orange, thin line shows net specie flows to other countries (total
flows minus flows from Argentina). These represented an outflow of 1,000,000 pounds, on
average, from 1886 to 1889. In essence, gold outflows would have been about twice as large
had it not been for the specie flowing in from Argentina.

What effect could this have had on the banking system? Figure 4.17 shows the reserve to
liabilities ratio of the Uruguayan banking system, along with two counterfactual ratios under
the assumption that net gold flows from Argentina to Uruguay had been zero. The first
counterfactual estimate deducts these gold flows from bank reserves and the public in
proportion to the percent of the gold stock held by each. The second counterfactual estimate
assumes the public held the same cash balances as it did in reality, and deducts the Argentine
gold flows from bank reserves. In both cases, the reserve ratio of the banking sector would
have been much lower by the end of the 1880s. Under the first counterfactual, it would have
fallen to less than 10% by 1890, while under the second, the banking system would have run
out of gold by that same year. Thus, net gold flows from Argentina likely had a large impact
on the ability of the Uruguayan banking system to maintain high reserves and thus adhere to
the gold standard.
The evidence presented in this section suggests that there was a benefit to Uruguay of being on
the gold standard that is not picked up by the traditional models. Bordo and Rockoff (1996)

highlight the relationship between gold standard adherence and long-term capital flows.
Countries on the gold standard could access capital markets at lower rates. However, we tend
to think of access to short term capital as a benefit that only accrued to countries at the center
of the international system, and indeed, the response of short-term capital flows is one of the
explanations for why the gold standard worked smoothly in core countries, yet was so difficult
to maintain in countries further from the center. However, if there ever was a country far from
the center, it was Uruguay. For example, Flandreau and Jobst (2005) establish a hierarchy of
countries based on the number of links each has to other financial centers.111 In this hierarchy,
Uruguay comes out near the bottom, and is in fact singled out by the authors as an example of
a country whose currency is quoted “almost nowhere” (Flandreau and Jobst, 2005: 989).112
However, because of its adherence to the gold standard, and more specifically, because of the
high level of reserves held by a large part of the banking sector, gold flowed into Uruguay from
its less stable neighbor. Argentines, seeking to hoard gold, but fearing putting it in fragile banks
in their country, chose to ship it east and place it in the relative safety of the Uruguayan banking
system. This provided reserves for Uruguay at a time when the overall balance of payments
was negative, and gold was flowing out of the country towards Europe. Without Argentine
gold inflows, Uruguay’s balance of payments deficits would have caused a much sharper
decline in gold stocks, with consequent impacts on banking sector liquidity, the money supply
and economic activity.
These short-term flows from Argentina did reverse course in 1890, just as the crisis broke. That
is, Uruguay did not benefit from stabilizing capital flows when its financial weaknesses were
revealed, as occurred in core countries when their exchanges fell (Eichengreen, 2008: 30).
However, up until this point, the flow of gold from Argentina had the effect of bolstering the
gold standard in Uruguay.
An alternative way of looking at the situation is to view the Rio de la Plata region as a whole.
Most of the region, within the Argentine borders, operated under a depreciating paper currency,
which benefitted landowners by decreasing their costs, in paper, as their incomes remained
111 Links are based on whether the currency (exchange rate) of a country is quoted in the financial press of other countries. 112 This general hierarchy, based on money market quotes, ignores what is likely a more salient factor in the Uruguayan case: foreign banks operating regional, with branches in multiple countries. In Uruguay, the LRP, among others, had branches in Buenos Aires and Montevideo, and could move gold from one to another at the behest of clients, or for its own purposes of liquidity management. The role of these banks in the financial flows between the two countries deserves further study.

fixed in gold. However, in order to protect their savings from losses due to banking sector
fragility, they deposited them in Uruguay. The gold standard adhering country thus acted as
the region’s piggy bank. Argentine landowners and others able to accumulate gold benefitted
from having a more stable neighbor, while Uruguay benefitted from Argentina’s monetary
volatility.
4.6 Conclusions
This paper has explored the impact of Uruguay’s gold standard adherence in the leadup to the
1890 crisis. It directly compares the experiences of Uruguay and Argentina in order to
disentangle the ways in which this policy affected the money supply, the banking sector and
prices, and how these in turn contributed to each country’s monetary and financial functioning
in the 1880s. It also examines the financial links between the two countries, revealing that
Uruguay may have benefited from its neighbor’s monetary volatility. The main conclusion is
that the differing policy with regard to exchange rates likely had significant impacts on the
evolution of the boom and crisis in each country.
Despite roughly equal bank money creation by each country in the 1880s, Uruguay was losing
significant amounts of gold through the decade, which, ironically, meant the overall money
supply was much more stable than in Argentina. In addition, the banking sector was able to
acquire gold from the public, likely due to its conservatism and reputation, which allowed it to
maintain high reserve ratios. This underpinned the gold standard and allowed Uruguay to
maintain a fixed exchange rate up to 1890. The main problem was with two banks, and
especially the large Banco Nacional, with close ties to the government, that over issued
currency in large volumes, and consequently lost gold reserves, eventually causing the
government to suspend specie payments for the bank. In this sense, the crisis in Uruguay had
a similar root to the one in Argentina: the use of state banks to finance deficits. The difference
was that in Argentina the problem was generalized to a large part of the banking sector, while
in Uruguay it was concentrated in a few specific banks, with the rest of the sector remaining
solid.
The focus of the Argentine literature on the negative effects of currency depreciation for the
government’s fiscal position seem to hold up. The Uruguayan government’s debt service
burden was lower than Argentina’s in relation to revenues, in part because it continued to
receive payment in gold throughout the 1880s. Even after the crisis hit, it received devalued


120
notes of the Banco Nacional at their market value, avoiding the revenue erosion experienced
by the Argentine government.
One important impact of Uruguay’s adherence to the gold standard was that it likely helped
attract gold from its neighbor, even as it was losing gold to the rest of the world. Without this
gold inflow, it would not have been able to maintain sufficient reserves to back note issue and
underpin the operation of the gold standard. This has implications for our understanding of the
relations between financial markets in peripheral countries. Despite the challenges that the gold
standard presented for peripheral countries, adherence made Uruguay an island of stability
among its neighbors on inconvertible paper currencies. Further research should explore
whether other peripheral gold standard countries benefitted from relations with non-gold
standard peers.

Chapter 5: Conclusions
5.1 Summary of research results
This thesis has explored the problem of how Uruguay adhered to the gold standard for 38 years.
Two types of questions are investigated. First, what were the consequences of gold standard
adherence in terms of the money supply, balance of payments adjustments, and growth.
Second, how did the gold standard actually operate in Uruguay.
In order to answer these questions, a range of macroeconomic and microeconomic evidence is
brought to bear. Uruguay’s annual balance of payments is reconstructed, including new
estimates of capital inflows and the services and unilateral transfers balances, from 1870 to
1914. Evidence regarding the balance sheet of the banking sector is also presented, including
capital, specie reserves, note circulation, deposits and credit. Estimates of gold stocks, and their
distribution between the banking sector and the public are also developed for the 1880-1900
period. In addition, monthly data on the domestic market discount rate, the exchange rate for
bills on London and gold flows are offered. Balance sheet data of several banks that operated
during the period is collected and used to elaborate indicators of banking sector liquidity. This
empirical evidence constitutes one of the primary contributions of this thesis.
The balance of payments data shows some striking results. The current account was almost
never in surplus. There were three episodes of large deficits: one in the early 1870s, one from
the mid 1880s up to 1890, and a third beginning around 1907 and lasting through 1913. These
deficits were financed mainly through capital inflows, which came in large waves, coinciding
with the three periods mentioned above. Data on gold flows is available only from 1878 to
1907, but is coherent in regards to the current trade and capital accounts.
Notes in circulation, deposits and credit evolved in the same direction as specie reserves in
banks, all showing a high degree of volatility over the long run. However, there were moments
when growth rates in the monetary variables outpaced growth in reserves, leading to drastically
reduced reserve ratios. These periods coincided with the episodes of large current account


122
deficits and capital inflows. They also coincided initially with periods of high economic
growth, the first two of which ended in sudden stops. The decision not to devalue and the low
level of gold reserves in banks meant that adjustment had to occur through import compression,
leading to large current account corrections and reductions in income.
The period in the 1880s leading up to the Baring Crisis, and the comparison with Argentina, is
particularly illuminating. Both countries experienced economic expansions, led by foreign
investment booms, that ended in severe financial crises in 1890. The role of depreciating paper
currency in the leadup to the Argentine crisis has been highlighted by the historiography, with
some authors arguing that it was a contributing factor. Uruguay maintained a fixed exchange
rate throughout the 1880s, and although it did not avoid a crisis, its financial and monetary
evolution was very different from that of its neighbor. Prices were much more stable, closely
tracking changes in world prices, as would be expected under the gold standard. Confidence in
the banking system attracted gold in two ways. The public, which had most of the country’s
gold reserves at the beginning of the 1880s, deposited large amounts in the banking system,
and gold flowed from Argentina, also attracted by the security that Uruguayan banks offered.
In addition, the fixed exchange rate meant the state avoided the erosion of revenues due to
currency depreciation that plagued its neighbor in the second half of the decade. However,
despite the more stable financial and monetary environment in Uruguay during the 1880s, it
did not avoid falling into crisis in 1890.
While in Uruguay the gold standard was imposed by the merchant elite, which controlled the
most important banks, shifting economic and political realities led to institutional changes, the
founding of new banks and departures from monetary orthodoxy. During these episodes, the
rules of the game were broken, eventually putting the gold standard at risk, as in 1890, when
convertibility was briefly suspended.
The 1890 crisis, as well as an earlier event in 1875, were the only episodes of major financial
instability, suspension of convertibility and current account reversal between 1870 and 1913.
Throughout the rest of the gold standard period the banking system managed monetary affairs
in a way that did not endanger the exchange rate. However, this does not mean that banks
necessarily followed the rules of the game. While episodes of financial instability were
associated with the procyclical overall monetary expansion, in the short run some banks broke
the rules of the game in the opposite direction. They sterilized gold flows in order to protect
their clients from volatility, stabilizing their provision of bank money. This may have had


123
economy-wide effects, since domestic interest rates appear to have been relatively insensitive
to changes in international rates.
5.2 Wider implications of the results
Several interesting implications can be drawn from the results presented in this thesis. The first
regards the difficulties that peripheral countries faced in their ability to adhere to the gold
standard. The gold standard created significant restrictions in regard to the money supply and
credit.
The rules of the game implied that changes in the money supply and credit had to move in the
same direction as the stock of reserves. If they didn’t, the mechanisms of adjustment, which
were supposed to act through interest rates, prices and economic activity, would be short
circuited, and there would be no natural force to move the economy back to equilibrium after
a disturbance. Allowing the money supply to grow beyond what reserves warranted put the
exchange rate at risk.
For a developing country, the temptation to depart from these restrictions was strong. The
country alternated between periods of monetary orthodoxy and loose credit policies, with the
latter inevitably leading to financial instability. In this sense, Uruguay confirms the main
conclusion of standard theory, that over the long run, the rules of the game had to be respected.
However, the idea that central banks followed the rules of the game has long been debunked;
central banks had more than one objective: preserving the exchange rate was of prime
importance, but so was managing domestic liquidity and smoothing shocks. That is, they broke
the rules of the game, at least in the short run, managing credit and the money supply
countercyclically with respect to reserves. However, the literature generally assumes that
countries without central banks were more faithful followers of the rules of the game, and that
commercial banks could not implement volatility smoothing strategies, and much less so with
economy-wide impacts. The results of this thesis point in the opposite direction. It appears that
private banks in Uruguay acted in ways similar to European central banks, using
countercyclical balance sheet management to reduce volatility that would otherwise be
imported through the balance of payments.
This is interesting because it implies centralized banknote issue was not a precondition for
domestic volatility smoothing. There were other countries where private banks could issue


124
notes alongside those of a central bank or large state bank with special privileges. However, in
these situations the private banks often used central banknotes as reserves, giving the central
bank some control over this secondary money creation.113 In Uruguay, there was no single
monetary authority until 1907, yet before this year, private banks acted in a way that secured
sufficient money and credit for their clients even in the face of gold drains, and in this way
likely partly shielded domestic interest rates from international shocks. It suggests that, at least
in some countries, the origin of central bank liquidity management arose not from the
privileged relationship of central banks with the rest of the banking sector, as suggested by
Goodhart (1988), but from the competitive banks trying to meet the needs of their clients.
Another lesson that can be drawn from our results is the benefits that a fixed exchange rate
offered a country like Uruguay. The gold standard literature highlights several advantages for
countries adhering to the system. It was thought to facilitate trade by providing a stable
international currency and eliminating exchange rate risk, thereby reducing transaction costs
(Meissner and Lopez-Cordova, 2003; Flandreau and Maurel, 2005). Countries also hoped to
gain access to international capital markets at lower costs (Bordo and Rockoff, 1996; Meissner,
2004). This was because being on the gold standard tied the government’s hands, and thus
acted as a signal to investors of their fiscal and monetary prudence.
However, there were other benefits that have been given less prominence in the international
literature. One has to do with fiscal advantages for countries with high foreign currency
denominated debt. The erosion of Argentina’s fiscal revenues in the late 1880s has been
emphasized in the literature on the Baring Crisis. The Uruguayan situation puts the Argentine
case into relief. Uruguay’s debt service remained lower as a proportion of revenues than in
Argentina, likely in large part due to its adherence to the fixed exchange rate. Although it
eventually defaulted on its foreign debt in 1891, this occurred a full year after Argentina’s
default. This specific effect on fiscal revenues is not generally mentioned in the literature that
contemplates the benefits offered by the gold standard.
A further important ramification of the results presented here is that financial links between
peripheral countries, even if not numerous, could have significant impacts for gold standard
adherence. The financial relations between core countries on the gold standard, such as the
113 For example, the Enskilda banks in Sweden issued their own notes throughout the gold standard period, but they used the Riksbank -Sweden’s central bank- notes as reserves. The Riksbank was able to implement monetary policy through its control of the monetary base (Ogren, 2003; 2012)


125
response of short-term capital flows to changes in interest rates (Bloomfield, 1963) and
cooperation between central banks (Eichengreen, 2008: 31-32), have been extensively
researched. The relations between core and peripheral countries have also been discussed, for
example, by Ford (1962), who highlights the unequal effects of long-term capital flows. More
recently, Flandreau and Jobst (2005) showed that financial relations between countries were
hierarchical, with some countries, like Britain, France and Germany, at the center of dense
financial networks, others, like the US or countries in the European periphery in a secondary
position, and countries like Uruguay at the bottom of a third tier, with very few financial links
However, Uruguay did have close financial links with Argentina (Morató, 1926; Flandreau and
Jobst, 2005), due in part to their geographical proximity, shared colonial heritage and similar
economic structures and immigrant stocks. As discussed in chapter 3, during the 1880s, large
amounts of gold flowed from Argentina to Uruguay, due in part to their different exchange rate
regimes. Argentina, on inconvertible paper currency, was experiencing rapid currency
depreciation, inflation and gold draining out of the banking sector. Uruguay, on the gold
standard, had a fixed exchange rate, relatively stable prices and, albeit with some exceptions,
generally healthier banks. The amount of gold that flowed in to Uruguay from its neighbor
compensated in some measure the gold the country was losing to the rest of the world, and it
bolstered the reserves of the banking sector. It was the high gold reserves of Uruguayan banks
that reinforced their reputation, and allowed some of them to employ volatility smoothing
strategies. Without Argentine gold, the reserve ratio of the banking sector would have been
much lower than it was, weakening the banks and putting the exchange rate at risk. Being on
the gold standard appears to have allowed Uruguay to benefit from its neighbor’s monetary
chaos. This suggests that more research is needed on financial links between peripheral
countries, especially in regard to relations between countries that have differing exchange rate
regimes.
5.3 Agenda for future research
This thesis has argued that Uruguay is a unique and interesting case: a small, peripheral
country, with no central bank, which maintained a fixed exchange rate for the 38 years leading
up to 1914. It is an attempt to insert the Uruguayan case into some of the most salient debates
in regard to the gold standard. However, the analysis presented in these pages reveals that
further research is needed to understand the way the gold standard operated in peripheral
countries and the consequences of adherence. Furthermore, the empirical evidence that has


126
been assembled can be further exploited in order to answer questions regarding exchange rate,
monetary and banking policy in relation to Uruguayan development.
A first step is to use the estimations of the balance of payments and the banking sector balance
sheet presented in chapter 2 in order to test more formal models of balance of payments
adjustments under the gold standard, and to investigate the degree to which, for example, they
occurred through changes in prices, incomes and interest rates. In some ways Uruguay is the
perfect test case, given its small size, high degree of commercial openness, strong dependence
on capital flows and lack of a central bank, since it is an extreme case of the peripheral
condition.
A second avenue of research regards the 1890 crisis. Chapter 3 presented comparable estimates
of trade variables, the money supply and gold stocks for Argentina and Uruguay that were used
to examine the years leading up to the crisis and the role exchange rate policy may have played
in their economic evolution during that period. However, the crisis itself and its aftermath was
quite different in each country, and the information assembled here can contribute to their
study.
One complicating factor is that Argentina and Uruguay implemented different institutional
reforms after the crisis. For each country, the specific reforms were in large part a consequence
of their experience during the 1880s. Argentina implemented an orthodox monetary scheme
involving a strict currency board and removal of note issuing powers from the banking sector.
The result was a slow deflationary process, which eventually allowed the country to rejoin the
gold standard in 1900, although at a devalued rate with respect to the par value of the early
1880s. As della Paolera and Taylor (2001) assert, the 1890 crisis and the institutional response
represented a turning point in Argentine history. Uruguay rejoined the gold standard soon after
the brief suspension in 1890, with no change in the value of the peso. It consequently
experienced a massive monetary contraction, something Argentina partially avoided after the
crisis. However, the problems created by gold standard adherence -limits to monetary growth
and credit- had not been resolved. These had been the main impetus for the establishment of
new banks in the late 1880s with priorities that eventually put the exchange rate at risk. Six
years after the crisis, the BROU was founded in another attempt to find a way to navigate the
restrictions imposed by the gold standard. Its charter embodied some of the lessons learned
from the crisis, and included, for example, strict limits on the bank’s note issue and deposits.
Over the following decades the BROU was slowly transformed into a proper central bank. In


127
this manner, the crisis was a turning point for both countries in institutional terms, a subject
which warrants further research.
Chapter 4 showed that some banks implemented strategies that smoothed economic volatility.
Two types of evidence are presented: micro level data with respect to the balance sheets of
individual banks and macro level analysis regarding the sensitivity of local interest rates to
external shocks. However, qualitative evidence about the perceptions and strategies of those
who ran the operations of the banks is needed. This requires different sources and methods than
those used in this thesis, but would add weight to the argument advanced here.
Finally, the introduction to this thesis stated that the ultimate answer to why Uruguay was able
to adhere to the gold standard for 38 years is that the people in power wanted it. In other words,
it is a political economy issue. This “why” question is fundamental for understanding the
“how” questions regarding the operation of the gold standard and its consequences, but has not
been directly confronted here. However, the political economy issues simmer under the surface
of each chapter of the thesis, and bubble up every now and then. One example is the question
of state banks, which despite their association with financial instability, arose time and again
throughout the period under study. Proposals for state banks were supported by diverse forces:
the professional classes tied to the state, the emergent industrialist bourgeois and agricultural
producers, as well as a significant portion of the cattle ranchers (Barrán and Nahum, 1971: 452
459). Changing economic conditions and shifting alliances allowed these groups, at times, to
wrest control from the merchant community and establish banks -the Banco Mauá, the Banco
Nacional and the BROU- that expanded credit and directed financial resources towards
neglected sectors. Another example is the inconvertibility decrees of 1875 and 1890, and the
reaction of the traditional banks and the merchant community. In these cases, these forces were
able to defy the government and the depreciation lobby, and impose their will, shutting down
the offending banks and putting the country firmly back on the gold standard. Acevedo (1903;
1933b, 1934a, 1934b) and Barrán and Nahum (1971, 1978; 1987) discuss these matters in
depth. However, future investigations can attempt to integrate quantitative analysis into the
political economy story, especially in regard to the volume of credit received by various social
groups. This research should also be carried out in comparative perspective. The relative
political influence of different economic actors in Uruguay should be compared to the situation
in other countries in the region, like Argentina, Brazil and Chile, where devaluation lobbies


128
were strong. This could shed light on the specific conditions under which the gold standard
could work in peripheral countries.

Appendix A: the balance sheet of the Uruguayan banking sector
This appendix presents aggregate time series regarding the banking sector from 1871 to 1913.
In section A.1, a reconstruction of bank capital, on a bank-by-bank basis, for the entire sector
from 1857 to 1913 is presented. In section A.2, series for specie reserves in banks, notes in
circulation, deposits and credit are presented. The balance sheet data is available for a limited
sample of banks for these years. Thus, the more complete bank capital series have been used
to arrive at expanded estimates of monetary aggregates.
A.1: Bank capital in Uruguay, 1857-1913
This section presents information on bank capital for the entire banking sector from 1857 to
1913. Data has been collected for almost every bank that operated during the period.114 The
series covers the entire period, from the founding of the first banks up to 1913, and allow us to
discriminate between domestic and foreign capital.
Bank capital is an indicator of the size of the banking sector, and is loosely related to more
directly economically relevant variables such as specie reserves, currency in circulation,
deposits and credit. In Uruguay, from 1865 onwards, currency emissions by private banks were
limited to three times their paid-up capital. Market participants may also be wary of holding
bills or placing deposits with banks that do not have minimum levels of capital. Thus, the
amount of capital invested in a bank may set a limit, either through government regulation or
via the market, on the size of other monetary variables.
114 The historiography mentions several banks for which information on capital was not found. • Five of these were opened in the 1870s: The Banco Unión in 1871 (BCU), the Banco Alemán-Belga, the Banco Mercantil del Río de la Plata and the Banco Herrera, Eastman and Cia. in 1872 (Acevedo, 1933b: 671; BCU) and the Banco Villaamil & Cia. in 1876 (BCU). These likely closed during the 1875 crisis or its aftermath. Another important institution is the Junta de Crédito Público, created in 1870 to withdraw from circulation the depreciated currency from problem banks (mostly the Banco Mauá) emitted before and during the 1868 crisis. It was state run and did not have its own capital, but acted as an emissions bank. It was dissolved in 1875. • A multitude of banks were opened during the boom years in the late 1880s. At least 20 banks were registered between 1887 and 1889 (AEU), although it is not known how many of them were ever put into operation. Many were likely speculative ventures with inflated capital figures.


143
Figure A.1 summarizes the number of banks operating in each year for which capital
information is available. The two banks founded in 1857 were quickly joined by several more,
peaking at 9 before the 1868 crisis. Numerous closures over the next years reduced the number
of banks in operation to two by the late 1870s. The number of banks increased during the Boom
de Reus, reaching 12 by 1890. In the first decade of the 20th century the number of banks begins
rising again, reaching 19 by 1913.
Figure A.1: Number of banks in operation, 1857-1913
Sources: See notes for tables A.1, A.2 and A.3. Note: Some banks that are known to have existed, but for which date of closure and capital figures are not available (see footnote 114), have not been included in this chart.
Tables A.1, A.2 and A.3 present the data on capital for each bank, the total capital invested in
the sector and the number of banks operating in each year. The date each bank commenced
operations and the date it closed its doors to the public (in the cases this occurred before 1914)
is also recorded. Table A.1 covers the years 1857, when the first two banks, the Mauá and the
Banco Comercial, were founded, to 1876, when the Mauá was finally liquidated in the
aftermath of the 1875 crisis. Table A.2 covers the years 1877 to 1895, the years in which the
country operated a free banking system, with no central bank, under the Gold Standard. Table
A.3 covers the years 1896 to 1913, after the Banco de la República was founded and gradually
acquired central banking powers.
Capital amounts are presented for each bank that operated during period. Several different
sources have been used. For the period before 1876, Pivel Devoto (1976) and Acevedo (1933a)
have capital amounts for several bank for some years, as does Joslin (1963) for the LRB. Since
bank capital was modified only occasionally, these figures have, in general, been extrapolated
forward until the next figure is available. For later years, capital amounts have been drawn
from individual bank balance sheets, many times published in the AEU or in Annual Company
Reports. There were several branches of foreign banks established in Uruguay during the 1880s

and in the early 20th century. For these, capital amounts have been in many cases been drawn
from Joslin (1963) and Winn (2010), and extrapolated using data on the capital of the mother
companies from the Investor’s Monthly Manual. Another important source is the works of
Jacob (1992; 1993, 1994, 1996 and 2000), which provide data from the 1920s; for some banks,
these figures have been extrapolated backwards when contemporary data is not available. Paid
up, as opposed to authorized, capital has been quoted whenever possible. Details on the sources
for capital figures for each bank are provided in the notes to tables A.1, A.2 and A.3.

f Jacob categorizes this bank (founded by a French immigrant) as domestic (1992: 13), but suggests that some of its capital may have come from abroad (Jacob, 1991: 10). g This bank was a quasi-state bank. Privately owned, yet its director was appointed by the Government and it handled the state's finances. h The Banco Español, founded by Spanish immigrants, was purchased by the Bank of Spain, of Argentine capital, in 1904. i This was a branch of a British bank with its main operations in Brazil and Argentina. j This bank was created out of the Mortgage Department of the Banco Nacional when it was liquidated in 1892. Officially it was a private bank, but in effect was controlled by the state, and was officially nationalized in 1912.

and fluctuated thereafter from around 4,500,000 to 10,000,000 until 1913. Of this, around half
was of foreign origin, with the other half being private domestic, until 1885. The increase in
investment during the boom years was mainly private domestic capital. After the collapse of
the Banco Nacional, the mortgage department was spun off and converted to a quasi-state
owned Banco Hipotecario127 in 1892, with a capital of around 1,000,000 pounds, and the
BROU was founded in 1896 with a capital of 1,000,000 pounds. Together, these banks had
over half the capital of the banking sector for the remainder of the period. Private domestic
capital had about 30% of the market from 1896 onward, while foreign capital had about 10%
or 15%.
The 9,700,000 invested in the banking sector in 1913 represented 9% of GDP. This was more
than the combined investment of the gas, telegraph, telephone, tramway and waterworks
sectors, which together had received accumulated investment of 5.300.000 million pounds by
1913.128 By the same year, Uruguay had received about 15,200,000 pounds of accumulated
railway investment,129 a massive amount for such a small country (Uruguay was in 3rd place in
Latin America in terms of railway kilometers per capital (Herranz-Loncán, 2011)). Resources
directed towards the banking sector were on the order of 60% of what went into railways.
A.2: The balance sheet of the Uruguayan banking sector, 1871 to 1913
This section presents aggregate time series regarding the banking sector from 1871 to 1913.
Specifically, series for specie reserves in banks, notes in circulation, deposits and credit are
presented. Data is available for a limited sample of banks for these years. First, the data in this
main sample, and its limitations, are discussed. Then, estimates of monetary aggregates based
on an expanded sample using the capital figures discussed above, and more representative of
the banking sector in its entirety, are presented.
Specie reserves are taken from references to “caja”, “encaje” or “reservas”. The series for
notes in circulation is taken from the line in bank balances referring to “emision” or “billetes
emitidos”. For deposits, the aggregate data presented by Acevedo (1933b and 1934a) under the

It was officially nationalized in 1912. 128 Own calculation based on Stone (1999), Esteves (2006) and the IMM. 129 Own calculation based on Company Reports for the Central Uruguay Railway Company, the Central Uruguay Northern Extension, the Central Uruguay Eastern Extension, the Central Uruguay Western Extension, the Midland Uruguay Railway Company, the Northeastern of Uruguay Railway Company, the Hygueritas Railway Company of Uruguay and the AEU.

category “acreedores” is used for 1871 to 1884. For the post-1884 period, where individual
bank balances are used, the information is not homogenous. Some banks refer to “acreedores”,
while others to “cuentas corrientes”, “depósitos” of various types, -“fijos”, “a plazo”-, and
“cajas de ahorro”. The sum of all these is used for the deposits series. For credit, the aggregate
data presented by Acevedo (1933b, 1934a and 1934b) under the category “deudores” is used
for 1871 to 1884. From 1885 to 1913, the categories “varios deudores”, “valores a cobrar”,
“valores descontados” and “cuentas corrientes deudoras” are used.
The sources available for specie reserves in banks in general do not distinguish between gold,
silver and other metals. We know that the major part of reserves was gold, as silver and other
metals were limited by law in use for payments, and the convertibility requirements for banks
were specified only in gold. An 1892 law allowed silver coins to be minted, in part to mitigate
the shortage of small denomination currency after the 1890 crisis. After 1907, when the BROU
had a monopoly on currency emission, part of its specie reserve was held in silver, but this
rarely reached over 10% of its total reserves.
Another problem is that in some cases bank balances do not distinguish between metallic
reserves and paper currency from other banks (they simply refer to the “encaje” or “caja”). In
the cases in which they do, only metallic reserves are counted. In these cases, the holdings of
paper currency from other banks was very small. For example, the Uruguayan branch of the
London and River Plate Bank (LRP) reports their holdings of notes from other banks from
1898 to 1904, but these never amount to more than 2% of their total reserves (AEU). This
suggests that the error that may arise from the banks that do not make this distinction is small.
For 1871 to 1874, Acevedo (1933b) presents totals for reserves, currency, deposits and credit
from December of each year. The banks included in those totals are the full set of banks
operating in those years. For 1879, 1880, and 1883 to 1891, similar figures are available from
Acevedo (1934a and 1934b) for March, but cover only note issuing banks, excluding banks
that took deposits and carried out other commercial operations but did not emit currency. From
1885 onwards, the Anuarios Estadísticos del Uruguay (AEU) present the balances of several
of the most important banks that operated in the country in each year, as well as those of some
non-currency emitting banks in operation after the BROU became the sole currency emitter.
These are the LRP, the Comercial, the Banco Italiano, the Banco de España del Río de la Plata,


148
The English Bank of the River Plate, the Banco Italo-Oriental and the Banco Popular.130 Again,
this set does not cover the entirety of the population of banks that operated during those
years.131
The series presented here have been constructed using the data from Acevedo (1933b, 1934a
and 1934b) for 1871 to 1884. For 1882 to 1884, the March figures from the following year
have been applied. From 1885 to 1913, the sum of individual bank data has been used. For
most banks, data for a particular year has been taken from the AEU for that same year. For the
Comercial, the data up to 1888 has been taken from the 1916 AEU, and for the Comercial, the
LRP, the Banco Italiano, the BROU and the Banco Popular, data from 1889 on has been taken
from the 1919 AEU.
For 1885 on, aggregating the individual bank data for notes in circulation gives an accurate
total, since all banks able to issue notes are in the sample (heretofore referred to as the “main
sample”). In the case of specie reserves, deposits and credit, the actual amounts are higher than
what can be estimated from this limited sample of banks.132 However, I have constructed
estimates of bank capital for essentially the entire sector. Information on bank capital is more
readily available than for other balance sheet variables. Initial authorized capital is usually
declared in founding statutes of banks and in the laws permitting their establishment. Initial
bank capital and later increases can also be found in the financial press, such as the Investor’s
Monthly Manual and local newspapers. The fact that bank capital is modified (usually
increased) only occasionally means relatively accurate estimates can be elaborated from a few
data points. The details of this reconstruction are presented in appendix B.
We can exploit the capital figures in order to estimate the aggregate levels for the other balance
sheet variables. If we assume that the banks not in the main sample held balances, on average,
130 The Banco Nacional was liquidated in 1892, but its balances show small, dwindling sums of gold reserves until 1898. These have been added to the total specie reserves series. 131 The years for which the Acevedo (1934b) and AEU data overlap (1885-1891), the sum of the data in the latter coincide to a great degree with the former for each respective variable, except during the peak of the 1880s boom and crisis years. 132 Román and Willebald (2015) present continuous series for aggregate specie reserves and deposits from 1870 to 1913, relying in large part on the same sources used here. They fill in gaps in the specie reserves with data from other sources, as well as arithmetic interpolations for some years. For 1875, 1880 and 1882, they incorrectly take the amount of circulating inconvertible bills, which the state had taken off the Maua’s balance sheet in 1875, as the current gold-backed emission in circulation. For deposits, they arithmetically interpolate the years 1870 and 1875 to 1882, and for 1903 to 1911 use the variations in the deposits of the BROU to estimate those for the entire sector. This likely overstates the level of deposits by 1913, since the BROU went from having minimal market share in 1896, the year it was founded, to occupying about half the market for deposits and credit in the 1920s (Roman, 2010).


149
in the same proportion to their capital as those in the main sample, then we can estimate the
actual level of monetary aggregates by expanding the figures from the main sample in each
year in accordance with total bank sector capital. This has been done for the private sector
banks, since it is reasonable to assume that the public sector banks behaved differently. Thus,
the balance sheet data for the BROU is excluded from the exercise, and added to the total
afterwards.
Figure 2.13 shows the capital of the private sector banks in the main sample as a proportion of
the total capital of the private banking sector.133 As can be seen, the capital of the main sample
represented varying proportions of the total private capital of the sector; 100% in the early
1870s, around 90% in the late 1880s, and around 60% to 75% after 1893.
Figure A.4: Proportion of bank capital in main sample, 1870-1913
Source: Own calculation, AEU and Tables A.1, A.2 and A.3.
To see the difference between the two estimations including and excluding the banks without
balance sheet data, figure 2.14 shows, as an example, the unexpanded and expanded deposits
of the banking sector. The assumption that banks not in the main sample held deposits in the
same proportion to capital as those in the main sample is likely too strong.134 The banks outside
the main sample tended to be less important, have lower capital, and may not have had as much
133 The Banco Hipotecario has also been left out of this exercise, since it was not a commercial, deposit-accepting bank. 134 After the Banco Nacional and the English Bank of the River Plate shut their doors in 1891, audits of the remaining note issuing banks were performed and 100,000 Chilean coins, called condors, were found in their coffers. An observer during the period claimed that, according to the total reserves of the non-note issuing banks in operation, they should together hold about 36,000 Chilean condors (Acevedo, 1903: 12). This observation reveals that the non-note issuing banks held about 26% of the total reserves of the system. The capital of the five note issuing banks (the LRP, Nacional, Español de Rio de la Plata, Italiano and Italo-Oriental) was 16,120,000 pesos, while that of the other banks in operation (the Comercial, London and Brazilian, Francés Supervielle, English Bank of Rio de Janeiro and Anglo South American) was 4,669,500 pesos, meaning that the non-note issuing banks held about 22% of the capital of the banking sector. These proportions lend strength to the methodology applied here, at least for the specie reserves series.

success in capturing deposits for a given amount of capital. Thus, the expanded liabilities series
should be considered an upper bound, while the unexpanded series is effectively a lower bound.
Figure A.5: Deposits of the banking sector (main sample and expanded sample), 18711913
Sources: AEU and Tables A.1, A.2 and A.3.
Figure 2.15 shows the full set of expanded estimates developed above: specie reserves in banks,
notes in circulation, deposits and credit, annually, from 1871 to 1913. Specie reserves were
lower in the mid 1880s than they had been in the early 1870s. Bank created money (notes in
circulation and deposits) and credit appear to have been high relative to specie reserves in the
early 1870s, but were reduced sometime after. Gaps in the data do not permit identifying the
exact moment, but it was likely during the 1875 crisis. The fact that the following decade was
one of slow recovery means that the four variables likely remained low during that period.
All four series begin to rise towards the end of the 1880s, and reach a peak in 1889 or 1890,
but collapse immediately after. Specie reserves fell to their lowest point over the period in
1891. Note issue collapsed by about 70%, and stayed relatively stagnant until after 1896, the
year the BROU was founded. Notes in circulation dropped again in 1904, the year that the LRP
emission charter expired, but began rising soon after as the BROU, soon to become the sole
currency emitter, expanded its circulation of paper money.

The expansion of deposits in the late 1880s was much more pronounced than that of currency
in circulation. While the latter rose by a factor of three between 1885 and 1890, the former rose
by a factor of nine in the same period. This fact has been somewhat overlooked by the
historiography regarding the Boom de Reus, which highlights the expansion of currency
emissions and the inability of the Banco Nacional to convert its notes, but does not discuss the
massive expansion of other bank liabilities (see, for example, Acevedo, 1934a: 546-552).
Credit followed a similar trajectory to the other variables, although growth rates were faster in
the late 1880s and after 1904.

Appendix B: Foreign Investment in Uruguay during the First Globalization: Capital Inflows and Returns
B.1 Introduction
This appendix presents the reconstruction of foreign investment flows to Uruguay during the
first globalization. Time series on capital flows to the country from 1864 to 1913 are
constructed in three main categories: public debt, railways and other foreign direct investment.
In addition, series for interest and dividend payments made on these investments are estimated.
The most important source of information on international investment flows during this period
is the database compiled by Stone (1999) for British capital exports, which contains the value
of foreign securities emitted on the London stock exchange annually, from 1865 to 1914, at
market prices. Esteves (2011 and 2012) presents similar figures for French and German capital
exports. These databases break down investment into three categories: public debt, railways
and other foreign direct investments. However, these works can contain errors and incomplete
information. Until recently, Stone’s statistics, and the works of Jenks (1944) and Simon (1967;
1968; 1970) upon which it is based, were the main source for the international literature on
investment flows before 1914 (Esteves, 2006: 2), and thus have been the most widely critiqued.
The main problems identified derive from the fact that only new listings are included (meaning
movements of securities between markets after initial issue are not captured) and from the
difficulties involved in identifying the amounts actually sold in London for bonds issued in
multiple markets simultaneously (Miller, 1995: 95-96). Furthermore, these statistics are based
upon published data on amounts offered for subscription in London. However, these amounts
were not always purchased by investors, and could be partially withdrawn later. Also, the
vendors could decide to keep part of the bonds for themselves (Simon, 1968: 19). In addition,
initial issues do not tell the whole story about foreign investment.
Miller (1995: 97), in reference to foreign investment in Latin America, suggests that “historians
need to differentiate more clearly among three separate calculations: the total value of Latin
American bonds issued in London over a set period; the outstanding principal of these loans at


153
particular dates; and the total value of Latin American government bonds held by British
subjects”, adding that the “actual flow of British capital”, and return flows from amortization
and interest payments are also important.135 He also suggests that Latin American official
statistics have been underexploited, especially with regard to this last issue.
Almost all major foreign investment in Uruguay in the late 19th century was British, although
by 1913 French and German investment had entered the country as well. For the estimation of
capital flows to Uruguay, data has been obtained from the international databases mentioned
above, as well as from local sources. Official Uruguayan government statistics exist regarding
external public debt emissions, while the Company Reports of railways operating in Uruguay
can be used to obtain information on capital invested in this sector. For other foreign direct
investment, there is scattered information from contemporary sources and secondary literature.
By drawing on data from both types of sources, we can get a relatively complete picture of
actual capital flows to Uruguay during the period. Here we present a first effort in this direction.
Foreign investment from 1864 to 1913 has been estimated in three categories: public debt,
railways and other foreign direct investment. Sections A.2, A.3 and A.4 discuss each category,
respectively, looking at the amounts invested in every year, cumulative capital flows, and
financial returns on outstanding debt. Each section details the sources used and methods of
estimation, and presents results, contrasting them with alternative estimates when relevant.
Section A.5 examines total investment flows and the relative weight of each category. It also
examines the net resource transfer from foreign investment inflows and the outflows resulting
from interest and dividend payment.
B.2 Public Debt
The international databases mentioned above draw on information about listings of foreign
securities in European stock markets at market prices. However, they contain several problems.
First, only new listings are included. Movements of bonds between markets after their initial
sale are not captured. Neither are reductions in circulating debt due to amortization payments.
Furthermore, in Uruguay, there were instances of large emissions of public debt that did not
make it to the stock exchange, and therefore are not captured in the international databases. For
example, Baring made a 2-million-pound loan to the Uruguayan government in 1890, but was
not able to place the securities in London due to the crisis in Uruguay and Argentina that same
135 Miller was referring only to public debt, but these issues apply in part to foreign direct investment as well.


154
year. The bonds remained on the Bank’s balance sheet, and therefore do not appear in Stone’s
statistics. However, they should be counted as a 1.5-million-pound capital inflow that year
(taking into account the discounted price). In the early years of the 20th century, the Uruguayan
state, looking to reduce dependence on British capital, turned to French banks to float bonds
on the Paris stock exchange. However, Esteves’ (2011) database on French investment does
not capture foreign public debt, and therefore the 1905 and 1909 bond emissions placed with
French banks do not show up in these statistics.
Due to these limitations, to estimate foreign investment in Uruguayan public debt, I have relied
mostly on local sources. The Anuarios Estadísticos del Uruguay published by the Dirección
General de Estadística contain information on the nominal value of public debt circulating in
each year, separated into “internal”, “external” and “international” debt. They also provide
figures on the total public debt emitted annually and total annual amortization payments. The
year-to-year differences in external and international debt in circulation grossly overestimate
the actual capital inflows for several reasons. First, not all bonds denominated “external” were
actually placed abroad. A portion of bonds emitted was often used for swap conversions of
internal bonds (or older “external” bonds circulating internally), and thus ended up in the hands
of Uruguayan residents. Second, the bonds that were actually placed abroad were usually
offered at discounts, so the effective capital inflow was often much lower than the nominal
value would suggest. Third, after the original debt emission, securities regularly changed
markets. Bonds emitted in Uruguay were frequently later exported to Europe, implying a
capital inflow after the initial emission. There were also years in which bonds were imported,
constituting capital outflows.136 There is the further issue of the “international” debt, which
was owed to foreign governments. These debts, although often appearing as emitted between
1864 and 1913, were diplomatic solutions to grievances for events which occurred before the
period under study, mostly in the 1850s, but some going back to the Colonial period. These
should not be counted as capital inflows even if they appear as emitted after 1865, since no
capital actually entered at the moment of their emission, although amortization and interest
payments on these debts should be accounted for.137
136 This phenomenon is hereafter referred to as “secondary bond exports”. 137 The data presented in this document does not include amortization and interest payments on “international” debt. This debt was about 500,000 pounds in the 1860s, rising to 1 million pounds in 1890, and falling to 500,000 pounds again by 1913. I hope to include information on this debt in the total estimates in the future.

This means that in order to get an accurate picture of foreign investment in public debt and its
returns, we must examine each bond series emitted during the period, and try to discern how
much capital actually flowed in as a result. There were ten external bond series emitted by the
Uruguayan state between 1865 and 1913. These are shown in Figure B.1.

Source: Nahum (1994). Note: “Year” is the year the loan was approved by the Uruguayan Legislature. The column “Discount” shows the percent of the nominal value at which bonds were taken by the foreign bank or syndicate that handled the loan, in the initial year of emission.
Two main estimates are developed regarding each debt emission: the nominal amount emitted
abroad and the effective capital entry. The first has been estimated by taking the nominal value
of the loan and subtracting the portion that was in fact emitted internally as conversions of
internal debt (or of older “external” debt circulating internally). The effective capital entry has
been estimated by subtracting the value of swap conversions of bonds circulating externally
from the nominal amount emitted abroad. In addition to these two estimates, the value of
secondary bond exports has been estimated, both in nominal terms and at market prices, when
relevant. Furthermore, amortization payments have been estimated, in nominal terms and at
market prices.
B.2.1 Empréstito Montevideo-Europeo (1864)
This bond emission, with a nominal value of 1,000,000 pounds, handled by the Brazilian
financier the Baron de Mauá and his bank in Uruguay, marked the first time the Uruguayan
government was able to access the London market for funds. The bonds paid a nominal interest
rate of 6%, were to be taken by Mauá at 60% of their face value and a commission of 2.5%
charged.


156
However, evidence on its placement in London is conflicting. Stone (1999; 252) reports
450,000 pounds called on the London market in 1865 (if sold at the same price as it was taken,
60%, this would correspond to a nominal value of equal 750,000 pounds). However, in 1871,
in an attempt to stabilize the economy after a banking crisis, the state guaranteed the unbacked
paper money that had been emitted by private banks. Banks were obliged to hand over the
securities against which the paper money had been emitted. Mauá produced 781,000-pounds
(nominal) worth of the Empréstito Montevideo-Europeo bonds (Nahum,1994: 17).138 The
Mauá bank had apparently kept most of the bonds on its balance sheet, unable to place them
on the London market. However, some bonds must have been successfully sold in London,
since the IMM reports prices for 1869, 1870 and 1871.
The law approving the deal was passed in December of 1864, and in February of 1865 the
government received an up-front payment by Mauá of 10% of 100,000 pounds (presumably
corresponding to a nominal value of 166,667 pounds). However, it is unclear when the
government received the rest (which should have been 500,000 pounds, minus the commission
of 2.5%, or 15,000 pounds). Since the historiography treats Maua’s delivery of these bonds as
collateral for paper money emissions as a surprise, I assume that the government received
payment for the emitted bonds (and thus, paid interest on them).

Year Nominal value emitted and sold abroad Discount Commissions Effective capital entry 1865 1,000,000 60% 15,000 585,000
By 1871, 185,100 pounds (nominal) had been amortized, while the remaining debt was
cancelled with funds from the Emprestito Uruguayo of that same year (Ferrando, 1969: 59;
Nahum, 1994: 13-17). Due to lack of more precise information, this total has been assumed to
have been paid out in equal parts every year from 1865 to 1871 (26,433 pounds, or about 2.6%
of the nominal value per year).
The market price at which bonds circulated and were amortized is reported in the IMM from
1869 to 1871. For earlier years, the market price is assumed to be 60% of nominal value, that
is, the value at which the loan was taken by Mauá.
138 Acevedo (1933b:570) reports a value of 592,128 pounds, which is about 75% of Nahum’s figure. This disparity could be reconciled if Acevedo is reporting the market value, which was near 75%, while Nahum reports the nominal value.

B.2.2 Empréstito Uruguayo (1871)
This 3,500,000-pound loan was placed in London by Thompson, Bonar and Co., paying 6%
interest and 2.5% annual amortization at par.140 It was taken at 72% by the bank, leaving
2,520,000 pounds (Ferrando, 1967: 76). Stone (1999: 253) reports an emission of 613,000
pounds in 1871 and 1,136,000 pounds in 1872, adding up to 1,749,000 pounds. For the
purposes of this study, the figures derived from the Uruguayan statistics have been taken as the
actual amount emitted abroad. Ferrando (1967: 77) reports a commission of 305,269 pounds.

Debt service payments were suspended during the 1875 crisis, and reinstated in 1878. An
additional 371,520 pounds were emitted that year to cover the unpaid interest during the years
of suspension (free of interest and amortization payments for five years). By 1884, when the
remaining bonds in circulation were converted to the Empréstito Unificado, 404,000 pounds
had been amortized. I have assumed these occurred in equal parts during the 11 years from
1871 to 1875 and 1878 to 1883 (36,727 pounds, or about 1% of the nominal value of the loan
annually).
The market price at which bonds were amortized is available from the IMM, and has been
applied to the nominal amounts amortized to calculate the effective amortization payments.
139 Figures in parentheses are negative, in this and all subsequent tables. 140 The renegotiation of this debt in 1878 stipulated that, after 1883, amortization would be made at market prices and not at par value (Ferrando 1967: 96).

B.2.3 Empréstito Unificado (1883)
This was a 11,127,000-pound loan, handled by Thompson, Bonar and Co., paying 5% interest
and amortization set at 0.5% yearly at par value. It was intended for consolidation of old
internal and external debts. Swap conversions were made in the amount of 3,467,520 pounds,
taken at par value, for the total of the 1871 Empréstito Uruguayo in circulation (presumably
abroad) and in the amount of at least 6,404,325 pounds for several internal bonds (Ferrando,
1967: 95-96).141 The remaining 1,255,155 pounds appear to have been sold in London at a
minimum of 60% of their face value (60% would equal 753,093 pounds). Stone (1999: 255)
reports a value of 837,000 pounds emitted in 1883, meaning they may have sold for an average
of 67%, that year.142 It is not clear from the sources whether this was taken firm or sale on
commission. I have assumed that it was taken firm, and thus have used Stone’s figure for the
capital entry series. The nominal value introduced abroad was 4,722,675 pounds (external swap
conversions plus nominal amount emitted abroad). Commissions were set at 1% on interest
payments and 0.5% on amortized bonds.

141 These were taken at anywhere from 30% to 130% of par value, depending on the bond series (Ferrando, 1967: 95-96). 142 This may be doubtful, considering the drop in the price of these bonds in subsequent year. By 1886 they were trading at 43.4% of par (see Table B.7).


159
*Commissions were stipulated to be paid as a percent of interest and amortization payments, and are therefore assumed to have been paid out from 1884 to 1891 (see Table B.7). The figure that appears here is the sum total of these payments. Thus, the figure for effective capital entry is merely illustrative. The real capital entry was higher in 1884 as the commissions were distributed over the course of 8 years.
In that year then, 57.6% of the securities were emitted in Montevideo. However, by 1891, when
this debt was absorbed into the Deuda Consolidada, only around 20% of the bonds in
circulation were in Montevideo, the rest having been transferred to London in the intervening
years (Acevedo, 1903, Tomo II: 265)143. Table B.7 shows the value of bonds circulating in
Montevideo and London in each year from 1883 to 1891, as well as the price at which they
were being sold in Montevideo. The “nominal value of bonds exported” has been calculated
by taking the year-to-year differences in the percent of bonds held in Montevideo multiplied
by the total value of bonds in circulation. The “market value of bonds exported” is calculated
by adjusting these figures by the market price.

For the 1883 loan, amortizations were made at par value,144 but actual amounts amortized in
Montevideo and London are not given. Only the total amortized in each year is discernible
from the existing data. Annual amortization payments in London have been calculated from
the total amortization payments (the year-to-year differences in the total value of the bonds in
143 This information comes from official statistics, which record the city in which coupons were presented for amortization and interest payments. 144 Par-value amortizations for Uruguayan debt were an innovation that ended up being quite controversial. Earlier loans were amortized at market values, a feature that would return with the 1891 debt consolidation, with the argument that par value amortizations created too onerous a burden for the government and contributed to the default of 1890 (Acevedo, 1934).

circulation), adjusted by the proportion in circulation abroad. This assumes that amortization
payments were distributed between Montevideo and London in proportion to the amounts
circulating in each city (as they were with the 1891 and 1906 loans).

B.2.4 Empréstito de Conversión y Obras Públicas (1888)
With nominal value of 4,255,300 pounds and paying 6% interest and 1% amortization, this
emission was meant to be used mostly for a swap conversion of old internal debts. However,
holders of those securities rejected the government’s offer and the totality of the bonds was
emitted in London by Baring Bros. It was taken at 82.5% of par value, leaving 3,510,623
pounds (Ferrando, 1967: 102-03, very close to the 3,610,000 pounds reported by Stone (1999:
256). Commissions for the bank were to be 3% of the nominal value of the loan, and, along


161
with other costs, amounted to 215,948 pounds145, (Acevedo, 1934a: 455) (around 5% of the
nominal value). Subtracting this from the above figure reported by Ferrando (1967), the
effective capital entry was 3,236,475 pounds. About 82% of this was used for the purchase of
old internal debt, while the rest was to be devoted to public works and land purchases.

Information on the amount of debt in circulation in each year, from 1888 to 1890, are available
from the AEU. Amortization payments have been calculated from the year-to-year differences
in these figures. These were 42,500 pounds in 1888, 45,100 pounds in 1889 and 47,800 in
1890, leaving a total of 4,119,900 pounds circulating in 1891. Since the debt contract stipulated
amortization payments were to be made at par value, these figures also represent both nominal
and effective values amortized.
B.2.5 Empréstito Municipal Externo (1888)
This bonds series was emitted by the Municipality of Montevideo, and handled by Baring Bros.
The nominal amount was originally 1,276,595 pounds, paying a rate of 6% interest and
amortization set at 1% per year. It was sold at 85% of its face value, for an effective amount of
1,085,106 pounds (Ferrando, 1967: 103). There is no information on commissions and other
costs. Stone (1999: 256) reports an emission of municipal debt in the amount of 1,277,000
pounds in 1889, a number very close to the nominal value of the bond emission. Joslin (1963:
135) claims that “the City of Montevideo Loan of 1889 had been a failure and had largely been
left in the hands of the syndicate that brought it out.” In light of this, the effective capital entry
is taken to be 1,085,106 pounds, derived from the Uruguayan statistics, but the year of emission
has been recorded as 1889, as appears in Stone (1999) and Joslin (1963).

145 Official sources report that commissions and other costs were a little lower, 175,331 pounds (reported in Nahum, 1994: 27), while Ferrando (1967: 102) reports a slightly higher figure of 274,147 pounds.


162
The proceeds of this loan were deposited in the Banco Nacional, at current and time deposit
accounts of different maturities and interest rates (Ferrando, 1967: 103). This allowed bank to
use the money for short term investments, or speculation, while the municipal government
earned interest.
The 1891 crisis interrupted the amortization and interest payments on this loan in that year. In
1892 a deal was reached in which the government emitted an additional 97,158 pounds in
bonds, at 75% of face value (72,869 pounds, around 6% of the amount in circulation that year)
to cover the first and second semester interest payments for that year (Ferrando, 1967: 123).146
This deal lowered the interest to 4% for 1892-1894, to 4.5% for 1895-1897, and to 5% for
1898-1900, and amortization payments to 0.5% for the whole period. The interest rate was to
rise to the original 6% and amortization payments to 1% in 1901, but a renegotiation that same
year left interest payments at 5% and amortization at 0.5%. This interest schedule is reflected
in the IMM data, and interest payments have been calculated from these rates and the amount
in circulation each year.
The IMM shows the amounts in circulation from 1890 to 1913 (Table B.12), and the year-to
year differences have been taken as the amount amortized in each year. As with the other loans
floated in the 1880s, the debt contract stipulated amortization payments were to be made at par
value. Thus, these figures also represent both nominal and effective values amortized.

146 These additional bonds were to be paid back with funds from the liquidation of the English Bank of the river plate. This bank was finally liquidated in 1893. I have thus recorded no interest paid in 1891 and added the nominal value of the bonds (97,158 pounds) to the interest paid by the government in 1893.


163
B.2.6 Empréstito de 6% (1890)
Handled by Baring Bros., this 2,000,000-pound loan was intended for covering that year’s
government deficit, paying off internal treasury bills and purchasing land for public works. It
paid 6% interest and 1% annual amortization. It was taken by the bank at 84.5% of its nominal
value, for 1,690,000 pounds. 4.5% was set aside for commissions, although with additional
fees, the amount received by the government was reduced by 127,322 pounds (Ferrando, 1967:
111). The bonds never left the Baring’s balance sheet due to the crisis that year (Ferrando,
1967: 111-12). This information coincides with Stone (1999: 257), which does not register any
capital movements that year. However, it appears that the balance after discounts and
commissions did reach the government (although some was lost in the collapse of the Banco
Nacional that year), and has been counted as a capital inflow.

Only 20,000 pounds of this bond was amortized before the suspension of debt service in 1891
(Ferrando, 1967: 112).
B.2.7 Deuda Consolidada (1891)
This 20,500,000-pound consolidation loan was approved in 1891 as part of the debt
restructuring following the 1890 crisis. It converted almost all circulating “external” debt of
the national government (the 1883, 1888 and 1890 loans, excluding the 1888 Municipal loan),
at par value, in the amount of 18,130,505, reducing the nominal interest rate to 3.5%. 626,283
pounds was used to compensate unpaid railway guarantees, while 1,200,000 in bonds was
reserved for promoting the construction of the Western Uruguay Railway. In all cases bonds
were handed over directly, none being emitted on the London stock market (Ferrando, 1967:
115-19). Stone’s database (1999: 257) shows no capital movement in 1892 (the year the deal
was finalized), or the years immediately following.
Bond holders were to receive 105 pounds worth of the new loan for every 100 pounds of the
Empréstito Unificado, 115 for every 100 pounds of the Empréstito de Conversión y Obras
públicas and 113 for every 100 pounds of the Empréstito de 6%. Part of the old external bonds


164
absorbed into the Deuda Consolidada were actually circulating in Montevideo at the time of
conversion, while those reserved for other uses were emitted locally. The sum of the Empréstito
Unificado circulating in London in 1891, and the total of the unamortized Deuda de Conversión
y Obras Púlbicas and the Empréstido de 6% that same year is 14,567,670 pounds, which is
taken as the nominal amount introduced abroad.147 Commissions were 536,074 pounds (about
2.6% of the nominal value of the loan). Since all of the bonds introduced abroad were for swap
conversions, they did not represent any capital inflow, so the effective capital entry is negative
536,074 pounds.

This circulation of this bond in Montevideo increased to 34% in 1907, and later decreased, to
30% by 1913. Although there was no capital entry as a result of the initial emission of this debt,
the movements of bonds between Montevideo and London do constitute capital flows. Figure
A10 shows the value of bonds circulating in Montevideo and London in each year from 1892
to 1913, as well as the price at which they were sold in Montevideo. The “value of bonds
exported” (or the capital inflow) has been calculated by taking the year-to-year differences in
the percent of bonds held in Montevideo multiplied by the total value of bonds in circulation,
and then multiplied by the price.
147 This matches well with the official statistics on the Deuda Consolidada, which show that by the end of 1892, 14% of the bonds were held in Montevideo (AEU, 1913). 2,098,300 pounds of the Empréstito Unificado of 1883 was circulating in Montevideo in 1891, and 626,283 pounds worth of Deuda Consolidada bonds was given to some of the railway companies operating in Uruguay in compensation for unpaid guarantees accumulated in the previous three years. The sum of these two figures, 2,724,583 pounds, is about 14% of the 19,268,500 pounds of this loan that had been emitted by the end of 1892.

B.2.8 Empréstito Uruguayo de 5% (1896)
This loan was contracted specifically to provide for the capitalization of a new state bank, the
Banco de la República, and marked Uruguay’s return to international capital markets after the
1890 crisis and subsequent debt restructuring. The nominal amount was 1,667,000 pounds,
paying 5% interest and 1% annual amortization. It was emitted at 71.5% of par value, for an
amount of 1,191,905 pounds (Ferrando, 1967: 130). Stone (1999: 258) reports 1,192,000
emitted in London that year, essentially the same amount. Glynn, Mills, Currie and Co. handled
the loan. Commissions and other costs were 75,177 pounds (Nahum, 1994: 45), about 4.5% of
the nominal value, leaving an effective capital entry of 1,058,383 pounds.

B.2.9 Empréstito de Conversión (1905)
Seeking to lessen dependence on British capital, the early 20th century Battlismo movement in
Uruguay turned to French banks to market its securities abroad. In 1905 the Banque du Paris
et des Pays Bas and Societé Générale (in association with Glyn, Mills, Currie and Co.) were
contracted to float a 6,912,838-pound bond emission, paying an interest rate of 5% and 1%
annual amortization. It was intended to convert internal debts and provide funds for public
works. Swap conversions in the amount of 1,345,168 pounds were executed. The information
on how much was actually emitted in European stock markets is conflicting. The Association
Nationale des Porteurs Français de Valeurs Mobilieres (PFVM) reports that a total of
2,911,169 pounds were emitted in Europe, 2,741,166 in Paris and 170,003 in London (Nahum,
1994: 57). The British counterpart to this organization, the Council of Foreign Bondholders
(CFB), reports that of the 2,911,169 offered, only about 1,600,000 was actually emitted in
Europe (Nahum, 1994: 56-57). Esteves’ (2011) database shows 2,800,000 pounds emitted in
Paris in 1906, while Stone (1999: 260) shows 212,000 pounds emitted in London the same
year. The AEU for 1913/14 presents figures on the nominal amounts of these securities
circulating in Montevideo and Paris each year from 1906 to 1913, as well as the amounts
amortized each year, both in nominal terms and at market prices. This source shows that by
march 1906 there was a nominal value of 4,498,221 pounds circulating in total; 1,670,657
pounds of this was in Paris, the other part in Montevideo. The bonds sold in Paris in 1906


168
reportedly fetched a price of 96.25% of par value, making the amount circulating in Europe
that year 1,608,007 pounds, very close to the figure reported by the CFB. I have taken the
figure of 1,670,657 pounds reported in the AEU, plus the figure of 170,003 reported by the
PFVM, as the nominal value introduced abroad (1,840,660 pounds). No information is
available on commissions charged.

The amount emitted rose by significant sums each year until about 1910,148 and the total
emitted over these years is 6,912,165 pounds, very close to the nominal value stipulated when
the loan was approved by the Uruguayan Parliament. Part of these post 1906 emissions
occurred in Montevideo and part in Paris. In addition, as with the 1883 and 1891 loans, part of
the bonds emitted in Montevideo were later exported to Paris. In order to calculate the capital
entry, we first must discern which part of the increases in bonds circulating in Paris were due
to fresh emissions (presumably at 90% of the nominal value as according to the contract with
the banking syndicate) and which part were due to secondary bond exports (at the market price
paid in Montevideo). Figure B.20 shows the amounts emitted in Montevideo, Paris and in total
from 1906 to 1913, from which information the nominal value of bond exports is calculated.

B.2.10 Empréstito de Obras Públicas (1909)
This loan was floated in Paris by the Banque de Paris et des Pays Bas, Comptoir National d’
Escompte and Societé Générale in 1909. The nominal value was 1,275,672 pounds, paying an
interest rate of 5% and amortization at 1% annualy. The bonds were taken by the banking
syndicate at 91.5% of their face value, for an effective value of 1,168,085 pounds. Esteves
(2011) shows 1,200,000 pounds emitted in Paris that year, close to the total nominal value of
the loan. This loan was approved for various construction projects, and therefore no
conversions were made. There is no information on Commissions for this loan.149

B.2.11 Treasury bills discounted abroad
Nahum (61-63) reports that soon after the 1909 Empréstito, the government began to discount
short term treasury bills in foreign markets. A 1907 law authorized this activity on the part of
the government at a maximum discount of 6%. By 1913, there was 1,276,596 pounds of this
type of floating debt abroad. Here I have assumed that the first bills were discounted in 1910,
and rose in equal parts each year to reach the value circulating in 1913.
However, when 851,064 pounds came due in July of 1913, and financial conditions abroad did
not allow the debt to be rolled over, The Banco de la República was forced to export gold to
cover half of it (the other half being paid with funds from a new bond emission in 1914)
(Nahum, 1990: 62). Here I have assumed that 425,532 was amortized in 1913. No information
on commissions is available. Interest payments are assumed to have been 6% per year.
B.2.12 Summary and discussion
As explained in chapter 2 of the main text, total nominal and effective capital flows have been
estimated from the data presented in this appendix. Adding nominal amounts emitted abroad,
nominal bond exports and nominal amortization payments gives nominal capital flows. Adding
effective amounts emitted abroad, effective bond exports and effective amortization payments
gives effective capital flows. These eight series are shown in Table B.26.

We can obtain the total nominal capital flows by adding the nominal amounts emitted abroad
(taking into account debt conversions), the nominal value of secondary bond exports and the
nominal value of amortization payments in each year. Taking the cumulative value of this
series gives the nominal value of Uruguayan government debt circulating abroad, as can be
seen in A.1. We can also estimate the effective capital flows by adding the values of effective
capital entry, and bond exports and amortization payments at market prices. The cumulative
values of this series can also be seen in Figure B.1.
Figure B.1: Nominal debt circulating abroad and cumulative effective capital flows, 1864-1913
Sources: Nominal debt, AEU; Effective capital flows, see text.
Figure B.2 shows the cumulative effective capital flows estimated above, and the cumulative
flows that would be obtained by taking the figures presented by Stone (1999). The main
differences arise from the fact that the 1890, 1906 and 1909 bond emissions are not captured
by Stone’s database (the first because it wasn’t successfully brought to market by Baring, and
the second two because they were emitted almost entirely in Paris by French banks), as well as
the secondary bond exports and amortization payments. My calculations for the amounts
initially emitted, while close to Stone’s for most years, differ to some degree as well. As can
be seen, relying only on Stone’s figures would underestimate the actual accumulated capital
flows by about 30% in 1913. This comparison reveals that relying solely on Stone’s statistics,
as is common in the international literature on capital flows (Esteves, 2003: 2), leads to a large
bias for Uruguayan capital flows.

Interest payments abroad have been calculated separately for each bond series by applying their
respective interest rates to the nominal amounts in circulation abroad in each year, and can be
seen in Figure 2, taking into account periods of default and reorganization of debts. The
nominal interest rate was on average 4.8% from 1865 to 1913. It was 6% during the 1860s and
1870s, falling to around 4% in the 1890s and remaining that way until 1913. The effective
interest rate on debt held abroad (interest payments as a percentage of cumulative “effective
capital flows”) averaged 6.6% over the period. This was around 7% in the 1870s and 1880s,
and slightly under 6% from the 1890s onwards.

A few other aspects of foreign investment in public debt can be explored with the data at hand.
Figure B.4 shows the Uruguayan government’s total nominal debt in circulation, as well as the
portion in circulation abroad (as estimated above). It also shows the value of debt denominated
as “external” (dotted line), although, as explained above, not all of this was actually placed
abroad.
Figure B.4: Total debt in circulation, total debt in circulation abroad and total “external” debt in circulation, 1864-1913
Sources: see text.
As can be seen, the debt denominated as “external” overstates actual foreign indebtedness in
most years. Bertino and Bertoni (2006: 13), based on this series, claimed that foreign debt
became the principal source of financing for the government in 1883. While it is true that the
internal debt began to lose ground relative to foreign debt after that year, it wasn’t until at least
1887 that over half of the government’s total nominal indebtedness was to foreigners. In the
early 1890s only about 15% of the government’s debt circulated internally. However, after
about 1895, internal financing gained some ground, but made up only about one third of the
state’s debt burden by 1913.
Figure B.5 shows the market price (as a percent of par value) for the 1864, 1871, 1883, 1892,
1896 and 1906 bond emissions.150
150 Average of high and low price for the year. For the 1864 and 1871 emissions, prices are for the London market. For the 1883, 1892 and 1906 series, prices are for Montevideo. For the 1892 and 1906 series, market prices in London and Paris, respectively, are available as well, but not for all years. In general, these prices differed from Montevideo prices by less than 2%. I have opted to use the Montevideo because they are available for more years. The 1896 bond series circulated only abroad. Market prices are assumed to be for London (although the AEU do not specify the location).

Figure B.5: Market price of four Uruguayan bond emissions (percent of par value)
Source: see text.
Debt circulated at a price from 40 to 75% of its face value in the 1880s. During the 1890 crisis
and immediately after, the market price fell to around 30%. Prices began to rise in the second
half of the 1890s, the 5% bonds reaching almost 100% of face value, while the 3.5% bonds
stabilized at around 70% of par value.
The yield on investment in Uruguayan public debt is shown in Figure B.6. Yields averaged
around 8% in the early 1870s. They were 10% to 15% in the 1880s and first half of the 1890s,
falling steadily after 1897, stabilizing at around 5.5% in the first decades of the 20th century.
The average for the period from 1884 to 1913 was 7.6%.

B.3 Railway investment
Railway investment in Uruguay was financed almost entirely by British capital during the
period, and in general carried out by British free-standing companies. Over ten different
companies operated in the country at different times, although throughout most of the period
the sector was dominated the Central Uruguay Railway Company (CUR) and its three
extension companies (Northern, Eastern and Western), which by 1913 operated over 60% of
the railway network. The Midland Uruguay Railway Co. had another 18% (AEU, 1913/14).
Company reports covering the whole period are available for these five companies, as well as
for a few smaller companies that were absorbed into the Central Uruguay Railway system.
Financial capital invested has been estimated from company reports for the railways for which
they are available. A large part of the shares and all of the debentures of the Western Extension
were in the hands of the CUR (which in turn sold bonds, denominated “Western Extension
Debentures”, to finance the construction of this line), and thus these have been left out of the
total investment series. Adjustments have been made for the fact that some CUR debentures
were sold at a premium, while some of the Western Extension Debentures were sold at a
discount. For the companies for which we do not have reports, the nominal capital in circulation
in 1913 is available from the AEU of that year. This has been adjusted by the kilometers of
track in existence in each year in order to estimate the capital stock in earlier years. For the
Ferrocarril Central del Uruguay (the precursor of the CUR), the total capital emitted abroad
is available from the 1874 Company Report. This has been adjusted by the same method as for
the other minor railways.
Figure B.7 shows the annual railway investment series estimated in this way. It also shows
annual railway investment obtained by combining the data on British and French capital flows
from Stone (1999) and Esteves (2011).151 The two series show the same general pattern of
patterns of investment.
151 The Esteves (2011) database shows French investment in the railway sector for only one year, 1909, equaling 461,460 pounds, although it is not known what this financed. It may bet that some of the securities for the Central Eastern Extension, the Midland or the Eastern of Uruguay emitted around that time were sold on the Paris Stock Market.

Figure B.8 shows the estimated series of annual cumulative capital investment (or the financial
capital stock), in current prices. It also shows the same stock as estimated from the data
available in international databases (a sum of the figures from Stone (1999) and Esteves
(2011)).
Figure B.8: Cumulative railway investment, 1869-1913
Sources: see text.
In the first half of the period, the estimates differ by about a million pounds, with the estimate
based on international databases being the higher of the two. This is due mostly to large
amounts appearing in Stone (1999: 253) in the early 1870s that do not appear in the other series.
For those years, the series estimated here is based on kilometers of track in operation, and
therefore may be biased. In the second half of the period the estimates coincide to a great
degree.

Information on interest and dividend payments on share and debenture capital was taken from
Company Reports. The average interest and dividend payments for the CUR was about 4.5%
per year, about 4% for the Northern and Eastern Extensions, 3% for the Midland and 2% for
the Western Extension. Some Company Reports are available for the Northeastern. This
operated independently in the 1880s, but was absorbed by the CUR in 1891, under an
arrangement where the latter leased the line and paid rent to the former. The CUR Company
Reports show rent paid in all years from the time of the arrangement up to 1913. The 1891
Company Report for the Northeastern shows interest and dividend payments totaling 6% of
capital. The next and only other available Company Report is for 1895, showing interest and
dividend payments at 6.5% of capital. Thus, a rate of 6% is assumed from 1891 to 1894, and
of 6.5 thereafter. For the railways for which Company Reports are not available, which tended
to be smaller, had lower traffic and suffered greater financial problems (Winn, 2010: 62),
average interest and dividend payments of 3% per year have been assumed.
Figure B.9 shows the rate of interest and dividend payments for all railway investment during
the period (Total), as well as for the individual companies for which we have data. The Western
Extension is not included since its interest payments were not sent abroad, but rather made to
the CUR, who owned its debentures. From 1880 on, interest and dividend payments were
around 4% of capital invested for the entire railway sector (using the series estimated from
Company Reports and the AEU). For individual lines, they varied between around 3% and 5%,
dipping slightly in the late 1890s and rising towards the end of the period.

B.4 Other foreign direct investment
Other foreign investments were concentrated in the utilities sector, as well as some industrial,
mining and financial services. Information on actual capital investment from local sources is
scarce. Stone (1999) presents estimates for other foreign investments, divided by category, as
shown in figure 11. Esteves (2003 and 2011) show other foreign investment spending, but do
not specify in which sector. Here, I have tried to match the figures appearing in these databases
to information for specific companies appearing in the Investor’s Monthly Manual (IMM), as
well as in the international literature and local historiography. For several categories, the
figures match relatively well, in terms of capital amounts and dates of investment, with the
major investments discussed in the historiography, although there are some known investments
that do not appear. Interest and dividend rates for several of the major British companies are
available from the IMM and Rippy (1952), and are applied to the total investment in each sector
to obtain interest and dividend payments sent abroad.
Table B.26 shows the total invested from 1865 to 1913 in the different categories reported by
Stone (1999).

B.4.1 Utilities: Waterworks
The second largest capital entry category is for waterworks. The original waterworks company,
established by local capitalists in the 1870s, was purchased by the Montevideo Waterworks
Company in 1879 for 7600,000 pounds (Montevideo Waterworks Company Report, 1879). For
most of its life, this company was managed by the River Plate Trust, Loan & Agency, created
in 1881, as a holding for several major railway, utilities and land companies in the region


181
(Lanciotti, 2017: 27). In 1879, shares worth 350,160 pounds (paid up) were emitted, as well as
250,000 pounds in debenture bonds paying 7%. Share capital was raised several times, reaching
850,000 pounds by 1913. The debenture bonds were converted to 1st and 2nd debenture stock
in 1884, and progressively raised to a total of 350,000 by 1913.152 The interest rate was lowered
to 5% in 1905.153 The years when there were increases in share and debenture capital
correspond roughly to the periods of expansion of the company’s infrastructure in Montevideo
(Bertino y Millot, 1996: 361; Finch, 2005: 219).
152 Stone (1999) shows investment in waterworks beginning in 1883, with two waves of investment occurring, one from 1883 to 1888 and the other from 1907 to 1911. These roughly match the years in which capital increases appear in the Company Reports. However, the amount of investment that appears in Stone is only 1/3rd to 2/3rd that of the Company Reports. This could be due to the River Plate Trust, Loan & Agency holding some shares or debentures for itself, thus putting only part of the stock up for sale in the publications picked up by Stone’s sources. 153 This IMM shows the debenture stock paying 5% from 1890 (the first year the company appears in the publication). However, the Company Reports show disbursements equal to or near 7% of the value of emitted debenture stock from 1879 to 1904 (23,500 pounds from 1890 to 1904, which is 6.71% of emitted debenture stock in those years). Furthermore, in the IMM, the name of the debentures begins to include “5%” in 1904. Before this year they are simply referred to as 1st and 2nd debentures, without the “5%”. For the foreign investment series elaborated in this paper, the information from the Company Reports has been used.

B.4.2 Telegraphs and telephones
Other large investments occurred in the Telegraph and Telephone sectors. The River Plate
Telegraph Company was formed in Argentina in 1864, for the purpose of connecting Buenos
Aires to Montevideo by cable, a task which was completed by 1866. The Montevideo and
Brazilian Telegraph Co., Ltd. was organized in 1872, running a cable connecting the
Uruguayan capital to the town of Chuy on the border with Brazil (Bright, 1898: 127). Rippy


183
(1948: 16; 1947: 233) reports a capital value of 88,856 pounds in 1872 for this company. In
1874, this system was connected to Rio de Janeiro by the London Platino Brazilian Telegraph
Company, of Brazilian origin. This company was purchased by the Western and Brazilian
Telegraph Co. in 1879, which also absorbed Montevideo and Brazilian Telegraph Co.
Telegraphic service to the interior of the country was provided by the railway companies,
which built lines alongside their railway tracks and established telegraph offices inside the
railway stations. These investments appear in the balances of the railway companies (See, for
example, CUR Company Report for year ending June 30th, 1884, page 29). Other, smaller
companies provided service to towns where the railway did not reach.
The first telephone service in the country was provided by the British Gower Bell company,
established in 1882, with a capital of 15,000 pounds (Winn, 2010: 74). By 1913, there were
over 30 telephone companies operating in Uruguay, with one large British firm, the
Montevideo Telephone Company dominating in Montevideo (Bertino and Millot, 1996: 359).
This firm had a total capital of 215,000 pounds (75,000 pounds in ordinary shares and 140,000
pounds in 6% preference shares). This company was not profitable until its reorganization in
1898, which lowered the capital to 159,172 pounds (72,680 pounds in ordinary shares and
86,492 pounds for preference shares, now reduced to 5%) (Rippy, 1952: 127-128).
Stone shows a total of 370,000 pounds of British investment in the telegraph and telephone
sector in the 1870s, distributed over several years, when the investments in the main Uruguayan
cable and connections to Brazil were being made. An additional 214,000 pounds appear in
1888, when the Montevideo Telephone Company was founded, and 90,000 pounds in 1908.
Due to the large number of companies that operated in this sector, and the international nature
of some of them, it is impossible to reconstruct capital investment on a company by company
basis. Therefore, for this paper, Stone’s data has been used, adding only 15,000 pounds in 1882
to account for the Gower Bell Company’s investment. Interest and dividends paid out by the
Platino Brazilian are available from the IMM from 1880 to 1901 (When its parent company
merged with several companies from other parts of the world to form the Eastern Telegraph
Limited), and for the Montevideo Telephone Company from 1888 to 1913. Here, the returns
for these companies are applied to the capital of the overall sector to determine interest and
dividend payments sent abroad (for the years in which information overlaps, as weighted
average has been used).


184
B.4.2 Gas
The first gasworks, established in 1852 in Montevideo by local capitalists, were purchased by
Mauá and co. in the late 1860s, although the exact year and sale price is not known (Bertino
and Millot, 1996: 360). The British “Montevideo Gas Company, Ltd.” purchased the
concession from Mauá in 1872, emitting with 500,000 pounds in ordinary shares. This was
raised to 550,000 pounds in 1875, and adjusted to 541,920 pounds in 1877 (IMM). Stone
(1999) reports a 500,000 investment in the gas sector in 1872 and another 50,000 pounds in
1874. Dividends were an average of 6% for the first two decades of the Montevideo Gas
Company’s existence. These fell to 5% in the 1890s and to 3.5% in the early 20th century, when
the installation of electric street lighting removed one of the company’s main sources of
revenue (IMM; Winn, 2010: 149).
Stone (1999) also shows 44,000 pounds invested in 1890, 13,000 pounds the following year
and 24,000 pounds in 1902, although it is not known what company these refer to. Here, the
IMM figures have been taken for the initial investments in the 1870s,154 while the figures from
Stone (1999) have been included for the 1890s and 1900s. The dividend rate from the
Montevideo Gas Company has been applied to the total capital of the sector.
B.4.3 Tramways
The Sociedad Comercial was founded in 1889, purchasing some existing horse drawn tramway
lines. This was the local affiliate of what eventually became the United Electric Tramway
Company of Montevideo, established in 1905, and listing on the London Stock Market, to raise
funds for electrification (Bertino and Millot, 1996: 361). Stone (1999) shows 73,000 pounds
of British investment in this sector in 1890, and about 200,000 pounds more spread over the
years 1905, 1906, 1912 and 1913, which roughly matches the United Electric Tramway
Company’s investment activity. This company first appears in the IMM in 1908, with a total
of 1,286,000 pounds of ordinary shares, preference shares and debenture stock, rising to
1,738,800 pounds by 1913. Here, Stone’s (1999) figures have been used for the 1890-1907
period, and IMM data for 1908 to 1913. The IMM shows dividend and interest rates of about
5% or 6% per year for 1908 to 1913, while Rippy (1952: 128) reports dividends on ordinary
154 The figure of 541,920 pounds, which appears in the IMM in 1877, has been applied here beginning in 1875, under the assumption that, of the 50,000 pounds offered in that second year, 8,080 were never sold (hence, the adjustment of the figures in the IMM two years later).


185
shares were an average of 5.5% from 1905 to 1914. The 5.5% average has been thus been
applied to the years 1905, 1906 and 1907, for which there is no IMM data.
A German company, “La Transatlántica”, was founded in 1905, purchasing the remaining non
British lines, and electrifying them soon after. Esteves’ (2003) database does not break down
the non-railway foreign direct investment statistics by industry, but shows small amounts of
German investment in Uruguay almost every year from 1905 to 1913, which coincides with
the electrification and expansion of “La Transatlántica” lines. There is no information on
dividend and interest rates for this company, so those of the United Electric Tramway Company
have been applied to the capital of the entire sector.
B.4.4 Canals and dry docks
Port works were financed principally by the state. Stone shows 13,000 pounds invested in 1872
and the same amount in 1912. It is not known what specific investments these figures refer to,
but they have been included in the investment series. The average dividend and interest rate
for the Utilities sector has been applied to this category.
B.4.5 Electricity
All investment in the electricity sector before 1914 was carried out by the tramway companies
or by the state, and thus is included in the investment data for those sectors.
B.4.6 Banks and discount companies
The largest single category of foreign investment was in banks and discount companies. The
London and River Plate Bank (LRPB) entered Uruguay in the early 1860s, and was one of the
major banks in the country throughout the period. By the 1880s, three other British banks were
operating in the country, including the English Bank of the River Plate, and the smaller London
and Brazilian Bank and the British Bank of Rio de Janeiro. These were joined by the Banco
Español del Rio de la Plata in 1904, of Argentine origin, in addition to a few other banks. Since
these banks had their main business outside of Uruguay, the international sources are less
helpful in establishing amounts or dates of capital investment. The IMM reports the total
amounts floated in London for the company as a whole, and does not distinguish capital
allocated to each branch. Stone (1999) reports capital emissions for Uruguay in this category
for three years, 1880, 1907 and 1912. These, presumably, correspond to capital allocated to the
Uruguayan branch of a larger bank or banks, but it is not clear how Stone was able to glean


186
this from the information available in the sources he used. Here, I have relied mostly on the
balance sheets of the few Uruguayan branches of foreign banks published in the AEU, as well
as some secondary literature, while the international investment sources have been used only
as a guide for calculating dividends paid.
The Uruguayan branch of the LRPB began operations in 1864, and was initially assigned a
fixed capital of 100,000 pounds, which was doubled to 200,000 pounds in 1865 (Joslin, 1963:
54, 55). The capital was increased again by around half, to 319,149 pounds, in 1885 (Winn,
2010: 48; AEU, 1885). None of these investments appear in Stone’s database.155 The AEU
show the Montevideo branch with paid up capital (capital integrado) of 319,149 pounds from
1885 to 1913.156 Here, the capital of the LRPB’s Montevideo branch is taken to be 200,000
pounds from 1865 to 1884, and 319,149 from 1885 to 1913.157
The LRPB was joined by a second British competitor, the London and Brazilian Bank, which
opened its Uruguayan branch in 1878 (Joslin, 1963: 79; Winn, 2010: 45 mentions it began
operating in the early 1880s). There is no direct evidence of the initial capital allocated to the
Uruguayan branch of this bank, although Winn mentions that it was a small player in the 1880s.
Stone (1999) shows 50,000 pounds158 invested in the “banks and discount companies” category
in 1880, which may refer to the London and Brazilian, since there was only one other British
bank operating in the country in that year. The AEU 1919 shows the bank registered its capital
at 230,939 pesos from 1912 to 1916, which equals 49,136 pounds. This last figure has been
applied from 1880 to 1913.
Furthermore, Stone (1999) shows capital emissions in the same category in 1907 (517,000
pounds) and 1912 (1,200,000 pounds). All of these years coincide almost perfectly with years
in which the London and Brazilian mother company raised capital, although the amounts are
much too high to be for the Uruguayan branch (and are likely for authorized, not paid-up capital
of the main bank). This suggests that Stone’s figures refer to the London and Brazilian, but
may mistakenly quote the capital raised by the main bank instead of that allocated to the
155 It is possible that increasing the capital of a branch would necessarily involve a fresh capital emission on the London Stock Market. If it didn’t, this would explain why the 1865 and 1885 increases mentioned, as well as those for the other British banks, may not show up in Stone (1999). 156 Since the AEU specifies the paid-up capital amount, the earlier doublings mentioned are taken as paid up capital as well. 157 Nahum (1993, p. 252) assumes that the capital for the Uruguayan branch of the LRPB must have been raised to around 400,000 pounds in the late 19th or early 20th centuries because agencies were opened in the towns of Paysandú (1893) and Salto and Rivera (1905), but offers no direct evidence for this. 158 Stone’s figures are for paid-up capital. See Stone, 1999, note 2 (page 32).


187
Uruguayan branch. Winn mentions that the Uruguayan branch of the London and Brazilian
was a small player in the 1880s, and it did not increase its capital until 1887, a year in which
the main bank also increased its capital. The IMM shows an increase in paid up capital for the
whole company (headquartered in London and with its main branches in Brazil) in several
years, including in 1881, from 450,000 pounds to 500,000 pounds, and in 1887 to 625,000
pounds, and in 1907 and 1912, by 250,000 in each year. If the figure of 50,000 pounds
appearing in Stone is the correct figure for the Uruguayan branch, which is reasonable, since it
would make it a “small player”, as claimed by Winn, this means that the company allocated
about 1/10th of its capital to the Uruguayan branch. If we apply this ratio to the total capital for
the company throughout the period, then the capital for the Uruguayan branch would be 45,000
pounds in 1880, 50,000 pounds in 1881-1886, 62,500 pounds in 1887-1890, 75,000 pounds in
1891-1906, 100,000 pounds in 1907-1911 and 125,000 pounds thereafter.
The English Bank of the River Plate, founded in 1881 in Argentina, opened its Montevideo
branch in 1885 (Winn, 2010: 46). The AEU show capital at 200,000 pounds in 1886, raised to
265,975 in 1887.159 The risky lending policies of this bank put it in a bad position to withstand
the crisis of 1890, and it closed its doors in October of the following year, being finally
liquidated in 1893 (Winn, 2010: 194, 199).
A fourth British bank, the English Bank of Rio de Janeiro, opened a branch in Montevideo in
1888 or 1889, with a capital of 50,000 pounds (Winn, 2010: 145; Joslin, 1963: 169). This bank
changed its name to the British Bank of South America, Limited, in 1891.160 The AEU 1916
shows capital unchanged, at 235,000 pesos, or 50,000 pounds, for 1912-1916.
Since little information is available on dividends sent by the Uruguayan branches of the banks
discussed above to their overseas headquarters, the dividend rate for the whole company has
been applied to the capital invested in Uruguay. For the LRPB, the available information begins
159 Winn (2010: 145) mentions that this bank raised its capital for the Montevideo branch to 40,000 pounds in 1887. This figure must be an error, for it is far too low in relation to the large currency emissions of the bank (which were limited to three times paid up capital). Furthermore, Winn (2010: 147) also states that in 1890 the capital for all four British banks operating in the country was 700,000 pounds. Summing the figure of 265,975 pounds from the AEU to the estimates of capital for the other British banks, we arrive at a figure of 697,264 pounds, which is very close to the total quoted by Winn. 160 The rebranding of this bank occurred when, in 1891, its Brazilian business was purchased by the Banco de Crédito Universal, an emerging Brazilian bank. The Rio de la Plata business changed its name to the British Bank of South America, Limited. Later that same year, the Banco de Crédito Universal sold back the rights to operate in Brazil for a fraction of what it had paid (Joslin, 1963: 169-70).


188
in 1869, when the company paid an annual dividend of 12.5%. Dividends are assumed to be
2.5% in 1865, 5% in 1866, 7.5% in 1867 and 10% in 1868.
The Anglo South American Bank (also known as the Anglo-Argentina Bank, formerly the
Banco de Terapacá y la Argentina) opened a branch in Uruguay in 1890. The AEU 1916 reports
capital equivalent to 50,000 pounds beginning in 1914. The bank is assumed to have been
founded with this capital. Dividends for the Anglo-Argentine bank are reported in the IMM
from 1890 to 1900, and for the Anglo South American from 1907 to 1913. The rate for 1890
was 5% and for 1907 was 9%. Here, I have assumed a rate of 6% 1901/02, 7% for 1903/04 and
of 8% for 1905/06.
The Banco Español del Rio de la Plata entered the country in 1904 by purchasing the business
of the similarly named local bank, the Banco the España del Rio de la Plata (Jacob, 1993: 23).
According to the AEU, the capital of the local bank was equivalent to 170,213 pounds in 1904.
Here, I have assumed it remained so until 1913. The local bank reported profits of 8.4% in
1903. The IMM shows dividends of 10% from 1907 (the first year the bank appears in that
publication) to 1913 for the company as a whole. Here, dividends for the Uruguayan branch
are assumed to have been 8.8% in 1904, 9.2% in 1905 and 9.6% in 1906.
Several more foreign banks entered the Uruguayan market in the early 20th century. The Banco
Alemán Transatlántico opened a branch in 1906, with a capital amount of 42,553 pounds. In
1910, Credit Fioncier, a French bank, established a branch in Uruguay by purchasing the local
Banco Cooperativo de Ahorros, and the Banco de Galicia y Buenos Aires, of Argentine origin,
opened a Montevideo branch, with capital amounts equivalent to 19,848 pounds and 31,915
pounds, respectively. The Banco Italo Belga entered the Uruguayan market in 1913, with a
capital of 21,227 pounds.161 Information on dividend payments is not available. Thus, their
dividends are assumed to have been paid at the average (weighted by their proportion of total
capital) rate of the other foreign banks.
The paid up capital and annual dividend (percent) for the five foreign banks for which
information was obtained is shown in Table B.28. The sum of the capital for the five banks is
taken as the total foreign investment in the banking sector.
161 These capital amounts are reported in the AEU (1916) for the years 1912 and 1913, and have been assumed to hold for earlier years.

B.4.7 Land and investment
According to Winn (2010: 268), by the turn of the century, around 40% of accumulated British
non-railway foreign direct investment in Uruguay was in urban and rural property. Stone
(1999) mentions 125,000 pounds invested in 1872, and another 37,000 pounds by 1890. Rippy
(1952) mentions the Prangas Estancias Company, with a capital of 116,000 in 1867, and the
Uruguay United Estancias Company, with 65,000 pounds in 1909. For the first company, the
author reports dividends of 8% in 1884, 5.4% in 1885, 8.2% in 1894 and 16.1% in 1894. For
the second, dividend payments were 9.5%.
The figures from Stone (1999) have been used for capital for the sector, to which have been
added those from Rippy (1952) for the Prangas estancia from 1867 to 1871 and the United
Uruguay estancia from 1909 to 1913. A weighted average of the dividend rates has been
applied to the total capital to get sectoral dividend payments.
B.4.8 Mining
There were several mining concerns that operated during the period, extracting small amounts
of minerals (gold and copper). Some of these may have accessed foreign capital (Buzzetti,
1959: 151-52), but little information is available on these companies.
B.4.9 Industrial and commercial
The small amounts of capital emissions reported by Stone (1999) in the commercial and
industrial sectors appear to leave out some major investments. The Liebig’s Extract of Meat
Co. was founded in 1865 (Rippy, 1948: 18; 1947: 234) and operated in Fray Bentos throughout
the period. The IMM gives capital figures of 250,000 pounds in 1865, 357,200 in 1870,
360,000 in 1878, 480,000 in 1880, 500,000 in 1895, and 600,000 in 1907. The country’s first
frozen meatpacking plant was founded in 1903 by local capitalists, but was purchased by the
Anglo-Argentine Sansinena in 1911. In 1912 a second meatpacking plant, of US origin, the
Montevideo Swift, was established. Bertino and Millot (1996: 184) report capital of around
425,000 pounds for each in 1912, although the construction and expansion of plants took
several years, and the capital inflow was likely spread out over this time (the construction of
the Swift plant was commenced in 1911 and finished in 1922; Libro del Centenario, 1925:
121). Jacob (1981) reports capital for Sansinena of 300,000 pounds in 1911, raised to 346,497
the following year. The AEU (1916) shows 425,532 pounds for the Swift in 13. The figures


191
for Liebig’s, and Jabob’s figures for Sansinena and the AEU’s figures for the Swift have been
added to Stone’s figures to obtain the total capital stock series for this sector.
Dividends for Liebig’s Extract of Meat Co. are reported in the IMM, and ranged from 7.75%
to 40% over the period. For the other investments, the average dividend rate for the rest of the
“other FDI” sector have been applied.
B.4.10 Other
Esteves (2011) reports French investment of 55,102 pounds in 1911. It is not known what this
is, but could be French purchases of the securities of a British company, and thus have been
included in the capital inflow series.
B.5 Total foreign investment
Figure B.10 shows the annual public debt, railway and other FDI series. Investment in the three
categories tended to come in waves, which seem to be grouped together. A first wave occurred
at the beginning of the 1870s, a second in the late 1880s, and a third wave towards the end of
the period.

Figure B.11 shows the total accumulated foreign investment in Uruguay from 1864 to 1913,
broken down into the main categories. By 1913, total accumulated capital flows amount to
almost 40 million pounds. Of this, 41% was invested in public debt, 41% in railways and 18%
in other foreign direct investments. The total annual capital flows series is shown in chapter 2.

Appendix C: Services and unilateral transfers balance for Uruguay, 1870-1913
C.1 Services balance
The services balance, sometimes called ‘invisible exports and imports’, contemplates transport,
insurance, tourism, capital and labor incomes and government services. For the time period
under study, reconstructions of only some of these are possible, as information on many of
these items is scarce.
C.1.1 Freight and insurance
Uruguay had practically no international shipping fleet.162 Imports and exports were carried on
foreign ships. Because the export statistics have been estimated with foreign prices, they are
“free on board”, that is, they do not include freight and insurance expenses. These would have
been paid by foreigners who purchased the goods, and should not be included in the Uruguayan
accounts.
Uruguayans would have had to pay freight and insurance expenses to foreigners for imported
goods. The imports series from Siniscalchi et al. (2021) used here strips out the costs for freight
and insurance. In order to estimate the costs for shipping and insurance, the percent costs
estimated in Baptista and Bértola (1999) has been applied to the import series. The result series
is about 3% of GDP before 1890, and drops to around 1.5% of GDP thereafter.
C.1.2 Net income from abroad
This category registers income to factors of production such as capital and labor that would
have been paid by Uruguayan residents to foreigners, or vice versa. Payments to labor, either
seasonal foreign workers in Uruguay, or Uruguayans temporarily working abroad, may have
existed, but insufficient information is available to make an accurate estimate. The very limited
162 In the mid-1880s, of the 8,000 ships that plied the rivers heading up to Paraguay, only 33 were Uruguayan (Jacob, 2004: 34).


194
data on Uruguayan capital invested abroad during the period indicates that it was likely
minimal, and therefore the returns to this investment have not been considered here.
The main item in this category is payments to foreign capital invested in Uruguay. This has
been calculated by applying interest and dividend rates to the capital investment series
estimated above. For public debt, the interest on bonds has been applied to the total amounts
of each emission circulating abroad. For railway investment, data on interest and dividend
payments was obtained from company reports. For returns to other foreign direct investment,
information is more difficult to obtain, and the little data available varies widely depending on
the company. In general, information on dividend payments was obtained from the same
sources as for capital invested (see appendix A).
The average rate of return on public debt was around 6% over the period, while for railways it
was around 3.2%. The average return on other FDI was 7.5% over the period. Total interest
and dividend payments as a percent of GDP rose from around 3% or 4% of GDP in the 1870s
and 1880s, to over 7% in the early 1890s, falling to under 4% by the end of the period.
C.1.3 Tourism
The first tourist establishments in Uruguay were installed as early as the 1870s (Jacob, 1988:
90), and were known to attract Argentines to the beaches in and around Montevideo.
Development of the beaches to the east of Montevideo, up to Punta del Este, began in the 1890s
(Da Cunha, 2012: 27). By the early 20th century, fomenting Uruguay’s tourist sector had
become part of Jose Batlle y Ordoñez’s progressive government’s plan for diversifying the
economy (Jacob: 1988: 92). However, data on tourism during the period under study is almost
non-existent. Figures on the number of visitors are available only starting 1920, while estimates
of spending per tourist start in 1940. Estimates of Uruguayan tourism abroad also start in the
1920s (Da Cunha, 2012: 51, 68, 70).
Acevedo Alvarez (1937: 47-48) suggests Uruguay’s net tourist spending was negative for
1928, for while Uruguay’s beaches were popular among Argentines during the summer
months, Uruguayan’s travelled to Buenos Aires and Europe all year round, and spent large
sums there. He gives a very rough figure of a deficit of 3,000,000 pesos (209,787 pounds) for
that year. Bertino et al. (2005: 129), extrapolating backwards from Da Cunha’s (2012)


195
figures,163 estimate the trade deficit in tourist services to be about 255,000 pounds in 1911,
298,000 pounds in 1912 and 170,000 pounds in 1913.164 This is in the same order of magnitude
as annual remittances sent abroad (see below).
From these figures, it is clear that tourism was likely a non-negligible item in the balance of
payments, at least towards 1913. However, from the data provided by Bertino et al. (2005) it
is impossible to reproduce their result, or to extrapolate backwards by the same method (using
the GDP per capita of Argentina and Uruguay), since they only give the net balance, and not
the levels of foreign tourist spending in Uruguay and Uruguayan tourist spending abroad.
Furthermore, it is likely that inward and outward tourist flows responded to different factors.
Uruguayan tourism abroad, to Buenos Aires and European capitals, may have depended on the
evolution of living standards of Uruguayans.165 However, tourism to Uruguay depended in
great part upon the existence of infrastructure (hotels, roads, etc.) that allowed access to the
country’s natural beauty.
These problems impede the estimating of the balance of tourism spending during the period
with any accuracy. Therefore, the figures for 1911 to 1913 from Bertino et al. (2005) have been
used, but the balance for earlier years has not been estimated.
C.1.4 Consular and diplomatic services
This item includes the cost of maintaining consuls, embassies and other diplomatic services
overseas, as well as the spending by foreign governments on these activities in Uruguay.
Acevedo Alvarez (1934) estimates the government’s spending in this category at 400,000 pesos
(83,915 pounds) in 1928. Bertino et al., (2005) extrapolate this figure back to 1911, maintaining
the same value in pesos. I have assumed the same levels for 1909 and 1910, and then
extrapolated backwards by the variations in the level of spending on the item “exterior
relations” which appears in government budgets during the period (these figures are available
163 Da Cunha (2012) gives figures for the total number of tourists and for those of Argentine nationality. The note in Bertino et al. (2005), below the chart where the figures appear, says that tourist spending for Argentines was projected backwards by Argentine GDP per capita, while tourist spending by Uruguayans abroad was projected backwards by Uruguayan GDP per capita. However, it is not entirely clear whether they consider all tourists visiting Uruguay, or only those from Argentina. Also, it is not clear how they arrive at total tourist spending (if they applied the per capita figures for 1940 to earlier years, they do not say so explicitly). 164 Bertino et al.’s figures are consistently negative from 1911 to 19130. This is despite the fact that, from 1920 to 1930, Da Cunha’s (2012: 68, 70) figures for total foreign tourist visiting Uruguay are about double those for Uruguayans travelling abroad. This means spending per Uruguayan visitor abroad was much greater than the spending of foreigners visiting Uruguay. 165 Changes in GDP per capita may be a good proxy for this. However, it was likely the upper classes that travelled abroad, and if inequality changed over the period, GDP per capita would not fully capture the relevant dynamics.


196
from Millot and Bertino [1996: 393] for the years 1869, 1874, 1880, 1882, 1886, 1888, 1894,
1900, 1907 and 1909). Information on foreign consular services in Uruguay is not available,
but it can be assumed that the spending was much lower than what Uruguay spent overseas,
since the costs of maintaining diplomats in Europe was higher than in Uruguay. Furthermore,
it is likely fewer countries maintained consular services in Uruguay than Uruguay did overseas.
The estimated series fluctuates between about 60,000 and 85,000 pounds per year.
C.2 Unilateral transfers balance
The Unilateral transfers balance registers transfers of funds made without receiving
merchandise or services in exchange. These include remittances by workers, and gifts or
donations between governments, international organizations and private citizens.
In the period before 1914, the only important item in this balance was likely remittances. These
were sums sent back to the home country in Europe by immigrants, and could have a large
impact on the balance of payments of both sending and receiving countries and play an
important role in financial development of the receiving countries (Esteves and Khoudor
Castéras, 2009b). Direct data on remittances is difficult to come by, and is therefore generally
estimated indirectly from information on the stock of recently arrived immigrants and average
remittances per migrant.
Donnángelo and Millán (2006) provide an estimate of remittances sent from Uruguay for the
period under study, based on information on total remittances available for 1911, and
extrapolated by changes in the immigrant population of Montevideo with data obtained from
municipal censuses for 1860, 1884, 1889, 1908 and 1930. This method contains several
problems. First, it assumes that immigrants sent money back home for the entire duration of
their time in the host country, contrary to the international literature, which generally assumes
they stopped sending money home after about five years, either because they had by then been
able to pay back money owed for travel expenses, or had decided to stay and invest in the host
country (Prados de la Escosura, 2009). Second, calculating immigrant stocks from only a few
data points does not allow them to capture the waves of migration, and therefore fluctuations
in the immigrant stock, which where characteristic of the period. Third, it does not take into
account changing wages of migrants and the effects of these changes on remittances.
Considering these weaknesses, I have estimated remittances in accordance with the practices
found in the international literature. These include using annual data on net migration,


197
assuming only migrants arrived within the previous five years sent remittances, and adjusting
for changes in wages (Esteves and Khoudor-Castéras, 2009a). I begin by calculating the stock
of migrants arrived within the previous five years, for each year from 1870 to 1928, using data
on net migration rates.166 These are shown in figure 2.5.
Figure C.1: Net migration and stock of newly arrived immigrants, 1870-1913
Sources: AEU, 1913/14
Calculated in this way, the newly arrived immigrant stock was around 7% of the population in
the early 1870s, dropping to around 2% by the end of the decade, before rising to 7% again by
1890. By the middle of the 1890s the weight of the newly arrived immigrant stock in the total
population had fallen dramatically, remaining about 1% or 2% for the rest of the period. This
is shown in figure 2.6.
Figure C.2: Percent of newly arrived immigrants in total population, 1870-1913
Source: Own estimation and population from the AEU.
166 Immigration data are available from 1866, but figures on emigration are available starting only in 1877. Therefore, the newly arrived immigrant stock for 1870 to 1880 has been estimated from gross, rather than net, migration rates. Net migration has been estimated from figures on passenger entries and exits from the port of Montevideo. Mitchell (1993: 94-95) takes these same figures to mean immigration and emigration. Nevertheless, it is possible that not all registered arrivals were immigrants, but rather that some of them were temporary visitors. However, reducing the arrivals figures to account for temporary visitors would mean we must also reduce the exit figures, leaving net migration rates unchanged. Exit rates are not available before 1879, so the net migration figure for that year was extrapolated backwards by the variations in the arrivals rate.

The immigrant stock series estimated above has been used to extrapolate backwards the figure
on total remittances from 1928 found in Acevedo Alvarez (1934: 51).167 This is the first
available estimate of remittances for Uruguay. This was then adjusted with a nominal wage
index from Bértola et al. (1999). The remittances series is shown in figure 2.7, along with the
one estimated by Donnángelo and Millán (2006).
Figure C.3: Remittances, 1870-1913
Source. Own estimation based on the AEU, Acevedo Alvarez, 1934 and Bértola et al., 1999.
The remittances per recent immigrant which result from this estimate range from about 16.5
pounds in the early 1870s, falling to around 11 pounds at the turn of the century, and then rising
to about 16.5 pounds again by 1913 (these fluctuations are due to changes in nominal wages).
These are in line with estimates for other countries. For example, estimates for remittances to
Portugal from emigrants to Brazil range from 20 pounds per capita in the 1880s to 7 pounds in
1913 (Mata [2002] cited in Esteves and Khoudor-Castéras, 2009b), while Prados de la Escosura
calculates about 14.5 pounds per Spanish emigrant for the years 1906 to 1910.168 A report
published by Uruguay’s Minister in Rome in 1882 showed amounts remitted through the Italian
consulate in Montevideo. These were on average 13.2 pounds per transfer between 1868 and
1872, 10.4 pounds between 1873 and 1877 and 3.3 pounds between 1878 and 1880 (Acevedo,
1934a: 289). The Anuario Italiano de Emigrazione has figures on total annual remittances sent
167 The figure for 1911 used by Donnángelo and Millán (2006) is taken from Bertino et al. (2005: 129). This work in turn uses a figure published in Acevedo Alvarez (1934: 51) for 1928, and extrapolates it backwards by the change of Uruguayan GDP per capita. I have chosen to use the 1928 figure and extrapolate backwards by changes in the immigrant stock and nominal wages, so as to maintain consistency throughout the estimated series. The 1928 figure is based on a figure for remittances sent from Argentina to Europe, adjusting for Uruguay’s smaller population and immigrant stock. 168 Prados de la Escosura’s figure is 400 pesetas, which I have converted considering an exchange rate of around 28 pesetas to the pound, using the peseta/dollar exchange rate data from Global Financial Data and the dollar/pound exchange rate from Measuring Worth.

from Uruguay to Italy by postal money order for 1901 to 1913, as well as the number of orders
sent per year, from which remittances per capita for Italians can be calculated using this channel
(as opposed to other channels like wire transfers or sending money with someone travelling
back to Europe). The results average about 3.5 pounds per order,169 lower than the per capita
levels estimated above. However, if a single person sent money back, say, three or four times
a year, the per capita figure would be in line with the estimated series above.
Remittances as a percent of GDP were around 4% in the early 1870s, but fell to around 1.5%
by 1883. They rose to 3% by the late 1880s, due to the large influx of immigrants in the
preceding years, but then fell off, stabilizing at around 0.5% of GDP by 1913. In other words,
remittances likely had an important impact on Uruguay’s balance of payments.
169 The figures range from 77 to 95 lira per order, which I have converted considering an exchange rate of around 25.5 lira to the pound, using the lira/dollar exchange rate data from Global Financial Data and the dollar/pound exchange rate from Measuring Worth.

Appendix E: When did Uruguay return to the gold standard after its exit in 1890?
The July 5th decree meant Uruguay’s exit from the gold standard. At what point can we consider
that Uruguay returned to the regime?
At the moment the government suspended convertibility of notes of the Banco Nacional, they
likely represented around 60% of the country’s total note circulation.170 The message sent to
the London agent of the affected bank, and circulated in the British financial press, stated that
“Today this emission is received everywhere, the same as gold, with absolute confidence.”171
This, of course, was not true, as the gold premium rose quickly to around 1.25 paper pesos per
gold peso.172 A week after the suspension of convertibility, the Economist reported “there is
now not one country in South America possessing a currency resting upon a proper metallic
basis”.173
However, the rest of the banking sector and merchant community quickly did everything in
their power to demonetize the notes of the Banco Nacional, not only declining to accept them,
but also refusing to do business with anyone who did. Three weeks after the initial
inconvertibility decree, the government had essentially accepted the terms of the business
community, decreeing that the notes of the Banco Nacional would be accepted for collection
of taxes and payment of government salaries at their market value, and that the government
could require customs duties to be paid in gold (Acevedo, 1903: 270-71).
The government clearly wanted to give the impression that the country was firmly on the gold
standard, even though the notes of the Banco Nacional were circulating at a discount. For
example, in March of 1891, in a letter to the Chamber of Commerce, the Finance Ministry
declared, “Quotation of the gold premium at the Montevideo Stock Exchange should be utterly
170 It was 56% at the end of 1889 and 62% at the end of 1890. Despite a 44% reduction in the note circulation of the Banco Nacional from 1889 to 1890, the other emissions banks also reduced their note circulation by, on average, roughly the same proportion (calculated from bank balance sheets, AEU). 171 The Economist, July 12th, 1890, p. 903. 172 Low of 115 and high of 136 for the month of July, 1890 (Acevedo, 1903: 299). 173 The Economist, July 12th, 1890, p. 890.


202
suppressed, although the value of the notes of the Banco Nacional can be quoted in the same
way as the value of other commercial assets ... Quotes of the gold premium transmitted abroad,
just as the gold premium of neighboring countries under inconvertible paper currency regimes
are transmitted, give room for believing that our country operates under the same regime, which
denaturalizes the truth of the matter and causes considerable damage to our credibility.”
(Acevedo, 1934a: 560).174 After this date, the gold premium (the number of Banco Nacional
notes needed to purchase 100 pesos in gold) ceased to be published, and the value of Banco
Nacional notes began being quoted as a percent of par. In the opinion of the government, the
circulation of depreciated notes did not mean Uruguay was on an inconvertible currency
regime, since all debts, domestic and foreign, were payable in gold. Under this perspective,
Uruguay would have been off the gold standard for only a few weeks, between the July 5th
suspension of convertibility and the July 28th law which declared the notes legal tender for state
business, but only at their market value.
The proportion of the total note circulation made up of Banco Nacional notes can be seen in
table E.1. In December of 1890, the nominal value of this second currency represented 62% of
the country’s total note circulation, although, if taken at its market value, it was only 40% of
the countrywide note stock.

Percent of market value of Banco Nacional notes in total note circulation is simply the nominal value of notes, multiplied by 100/gold premium.
By December of 1890, the situation of the bank had not improved, and the government
extended the suspension of specie payments for another six months, and submitted a plan for
reorganizing the bank. It included a partial reopening of conversion: the bank would amortize
300,000 pesos per month (almost 64,000 pounds), financed by a 600,000-pound loan from the
Banco Popular de Rio de Janeiro (Acevedo, 1903: 272). By the time the Banco Nacional fully

203
reopened conversion in July of 1891, the funds were almost exhausted and the total collapse of
the bank ensued. By September of 1891, the Banco Nacional was in liquidation.175 In
December of that year, the note circulation of the bank had fallen to 29% of the country’s total
note stock (20% if taken at its market value). The liquidation was finalized in March of 1892,
the assets and liabilities of the bank being passed to the government, while the shareholders
received internal government debt in compensation. By the November of that year, the notes
of the Banco Nacional were 25% of the country’s total note circulation, 12% at market value.
By the end of 1893, these figures were 21% and 8%.
Most definitions of the gold standard refer to countries with central banks or direct government
control of paper currency issue. For example, Bordo (1999: 6) defines it the following way:
“Under a gold standard the monetary authority ... fixes the price of gold in terms of national
currency. By being willing to buy and sell gold freely at the mint price, the authority maintains
the fixed price. There are no restrictions to the ownership or use of gold.” For Eichengreen
(1992: 21), countries where “money in circulation took the form mainly of paper, silver, and
token coin ... were on the gold standard in that their governments stood ready to convert their
monies into gold at a fixed price on demand.”
It is clear that Uruguay doesn’t quite fit into the definitions of the gold standard mentioned
above. Between July of 1890 and September of 1891, the country essentially had two
currencies: one, fully convertible to gold, emitted by the Banco Comercial, the London and
River Plate, the English Bank of the River Plate and the Banco de España y el Rio de la Palta,
and another, the inconvertible notes of the Banco Nacional, which circulated at a discount. This
situation could arise because the country had multiple currency issuing banks, something not
contemplated in the definitions of the gold standard mentioned above.
Flandreau and Zumer (2004: 37) categorize countries as being on the gold standard if their
exchange rate remained within the gold points for at least six consecutive months within a
given year.176 Figure E.1 shows the monthly peso exchange rate for bills on London, that is,
the peso price of a bill of exchange with a nominal value of one pound, payable in London,
175 It is assumed that from this point on the government ceased to accept the notes for payment of taxes and use them for payment of salaries and other expenses. However, it is not completely clear from the sources if this is so. 176 The gold points were the price at which it would have been cheaper to ship gold rather than purchase a bill of exchange, and form a band within which the exchange rate could fluctuate without triggering gold exports or imports. We do not know the exact position of the gold points for Uruguay in this period, as they are difficult to estimate, and likely varied over time.

from November of 1876 to December of 1913.177 The original source of the data is the
Montevideo Stock Exchange, which published the exchange rate daily.
Figure E.1: monthly exchange rate for bills on London, 1876-1913
Sources: AEU and Boletín de la Bolsa de Comercio de Montevideo.
These figures, of course, refer to convertible paper currency; not the exchange rate for the
inconvertible notes of the Banco Nacional, which would have been higher from July of 1890
onwards. However, it was the rate for convertible currency that was reported, not only in the
Uruguayan financial press, but also the foreign publications. For example, the table “Foreign
Rates of Exchange on London” published in The Economist always quotes the exchange rate
for convertible currency for “Montevideo”, even in the months after July of 1890. As can be
seen in the graph, there was no particularly noticeable deviation in this exchange rate from July
of 1890 to September of 1891. In fact, the exchange rate deviation was larger in the last years
of the 1880s than during the crisis.178
The exchange rate for the Banco Nacional notes did deviate widely from parity. Figure E.2
shows this exchange rate (orange dotted line),179 along with the exchange rate for convertible
177 The data has been collected from the Boletín de la Bolsa de Comercio de Montevideo, the AEU and several newspapers. The actual figures published are for 3-month bills of exchange, and are quoted in pennies per peso. Here, I quote them in pesos per pound, and have converted them into a spot rate (see chapter 4 for detailed sources and the formula for conversion to a spot rate). 178 There are two months, July and August of 1891, for which there is no information because the Montevideo Stock Market was closed. Could there have been a major exchange rate deviation in this period? Jurgen (1997: 300) presents data on the Uruguayan peso exchange rate for three months bills on London taken from the Economist that are slightly different from those taken from Uruguayan sources, but that have figures for July and August of 1891 (figure xx). They show the exchange rate remains stable in those months.

currency (blue dashed line) discussed above. It also shows a weighted average of the two
exchange rates, which takes into account the proportion of each type of currency in the
country’s total note circulation.180
The exchange rate for inconvertible Banco Nacional notes rose to 7.2 pesos per pound (from a
par value of 4.7 pesos per pound) in December of 1890. It then fell to 4.8 in June of the next
year, as convertibility was about to be resumed. It then began a steady climb, reaching 14.6 in
November of 1893. After 1893, the exchange rate fell to around 6 or 7 pesos per pound, as the
number of inconvertible notes in circulation dwindled, and confidence that they would
eventually be amortized rose.

Total and Banco Nacional note circulation for January to November have been interpolated from the December figures. Total note circulation likely fluctuated widely throughout the year, following the needs of the agricultural economy, and thus the figures presented here are a very rough estimate of actual currency proportions.

The weighted exchange rate followed a similar trajectory up to mid 1891, reaching 6.2 pesos
per pound at the end of 1890. From the middle of 1890, it rose much less than the inconvertible
exchange rate, due to the rapidly falling proportion of Banco Nacional notes in circulation. The
weighted exchange rate peaked in October of 1892, at 6.4 pesos per pound, and then fell
gradually, essentially converging with the convertible peso exchange rate by the end of 1893.
The percent deviation from par of the weighted exchange rate can be seen in figure E.3. This
exchange rate was appreciated by over 10% for most of the months from September of 1890
to September of 1893. If the variation in the weighted average of the exchange rates of
convertible and inconvertible currency is the criteria, it cannot be said that Uruguay was back
on the gold standard before the end of 1893.
In summary, we have three different moments for which it could be said that Uruguay rejoined
the gold standard after its exit in mid 1890. The first occurred by the end of July of 1890, which
was the Uruguayan government’s perspective, just over three weeks after exit. A second, which
coincides with the official closing, and initiation of liquidation, of the Banco Nacional, in
September of 1891, or 15 months after exit. And a third moment, when the variation of the
weighted exchange rate converged with that of the convertible exchange rate, towards the end
of 1893. The date selected depends on one’s definition of the gold standard.
