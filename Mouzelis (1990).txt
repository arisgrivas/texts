guarantees to private enterprise under the NEP system, how can people today trust the promises if the Party continues to hold its monopoly of power? Economic historians will be pleased that the author makes good use of the neglected economic studies and commentaries of the 1920s. He did not succumb to an avalanche of details offered by Soviet historians peddling their officialthesesaboutthe originsofthe Stalinistsystem. Surprisingly, however, he defers to the authority ofWalter Duranty who gotthe Pulitzer Prize for his reports on the USSR; but it has been recently demostrated that Duranty used the New York Times to deceive the outside world and cover up the tragic famine in Ukraine in 1933. The present reviewer agrees with the underlying thesis of the monograph that NEP was not merely an ever-changing historical phase, but a distinctly structured well-functioning system. As a relatively humane and viable economic model of market socialism, NEP deserves to be studied and understood.

This volume is a clear indication ofthe considerable progress that research in Greece’s economic history has made in the last two decades. It deals in an imaginative and illuminating manner with the constitution, reproduction, and long-term transformation ofthe Greek financial networks and markets fromthe eighteenth century until the inter-war years. Furthermore, it shows the relevance of such networks for the type of development or underdevelopment that has been experienced in Greece. The editor is also the main contributor to the volume, since his three chapters of synthesis are responsible for more than half the text, and set the general themes that are discussed and further elaborated by the other contributors. In the introductory chapter, Dertilis gives an overall picture of Greek development duringthe period under consideration, focusing particularly on those specificities of the Greek case that are relevant to the book’s main area of concern. From this perspective he discusses the prominent role that Greek merchants and financiers have played within and outside the Ottoman empire; the relations between the Greek bourgeoisie diaspora and the indigenous dominant classes in post-independence Greece; the relative weakness of big landed property in the nineteenth century; the predominance (particularly in the Pelo

ponnese) of small agricultural producers whose output was controlled by local merchants and usurers; the connections between merchant finance capital and a chronically indebted state that was using vast resources for its own extended reproduction and for achievingirredentist goals; the great openness ofthe nineteenth-century Greek economy and its dependence on international financial networks partly controlled by diaspora Greeks; etc. : After this overview, Dertilis focuses more directly on credit networks and their development from the eighteenth century onwards. He shows that, notwithstandingthe developmentofthe banking system and the influx of diaspora capital during the last three decades of the nineteenth century, credit fragmentation still persisted — the Greekeconomynot managingto develop an integrated financial market. Throughout the century, credit demand at village level was met by the local merchants-cum-usurers who, in their turn, were linked with usurers and merchants higher up in the financial hierarchy, at the top of which stood the country’s two major banks (the National Bank and the Ionian Bank). These banks preferred to lend to merchants and financiers who could provide serious collateral, rather than directly to small producers. In this way the various intermediaries were profiting from the difference between the banks’ rate ofinterest (6 to 10 percent) and the exorbitant rates demanded from the peasants (from 14 up to 50 percent). According to Dertilis, this highly complex, strongly hierarchised system of intermediaries did not permit the kind of competition that could eventually lower the costofcreditand eliminate the oligopolisticor monopolistic controls the usurer and merchant were exercising at village level. The local money lender was notatall competingwith others ofhis kind, but was simplyaclientofthe money-lenderhigher up. Fromthis pointofviewthe local markets had a segmental character, in the sense that they did not lead to an integrated, national market. This credit system lasted until the late 1920s, when the State, via the newly established Agricultural Bank of Greece eventualy broke the stranglehold over the peasant household by the local usurers and financial middlemen by lending directly to the small producers. L. Fontaine shows, with reference to John Campbell’santhropological study of a transhumant shepherd community, the various credit networks and arrangements that tied the community to city merchants, suggesting interesting points of comparison with a similar community in Oisans, France. N. Bakounakis’s contribution concentrates on the connection between the PeloponneSian raisin growers and the merchants and financiers, both foreign and indigenous, residingin the town of Petras. C. Hadjiiossif, finally, examines the financial networks of Greek-controlled banks in Alexandria, their involvement in the formation of big industrial capitalist units followed Marx’s Way II rather than his way I:i.e.that, as a rule, Greek industrialists came not fromtheranks ofsmall

artisans but from merchants and financiers. À second qualification ofthe thesis that Greek capital avoided industry during this period comes from K. Kostis, who shows that, contrary to what has been generally accepted, banks did finance industrial projects — albeit almost exclusively big ones. C. Agriantoni shows a very important acceleration of the industrialising process during the 1860s and 18705, due to favourable national and international circumstances. The situation changed for the worse, however, in the last quarter ofthe century, when technological advances in the West accelerated exactly at the moment when, duetorelativeabundance oflabour, Greekindustrial capital opted forlabour-intensive technologies. In the last chapter of the volume, Dertilis pulls together the various points made about finance andits relationship to industrialisation. He first notes that, despite the qualifications elaborated by Agriantoni and Kostis, the overall ninteenth-century Greek industrial project was both modest and fragile, and that oneisthereforequitejustifiedtospeakofGreece’sfailuretoindustrialiseinthat period. For Dertilis this failure is to a large extent due to the long-term scarcity of both unskilled and skilled labour in nineteenth-century Greek industry. If the predominance of peasant smallholders, and the wholesale emigration of landless peasants unwillingto join the proletariat explain the non-availability of cheap unskilled workers, the lack of practical and vocational training in the Greek educational system explains the non-availability of skilled ones. A second major reason for Greece’s failure to industrialise in the nineteenth centuryliesinthe strategies ofthe capitalists — indigenous, diaspora, or foreign — who, with a few exceptions, were reluctanttoinvestin industry. Itis not difficult to see why this should be so, if one takes into account that investments in commerce were more profitable and that, duetotheoligopolisticcharcterofthe
financial markets, the returns from a variety of financial placements were even more so. For Dertilis the overall picture is gloomy, despite the three short periods (1860-75, 1920-30, 1950-70) when the process of industrialisation seemed to gain momentumin Greece. Eaeh ofthesethree periods,and particularlythe second and third, were followed by severe crisis which, instead of leading to the modernising and restructuring of industry, generated a process of de-industrialisation. For Dertilisthisis not surprising, giventhenon-competitive character of Greek industrial enterprises, the lack of a long-term strategy for modernisation with a view to exporting industrial products, and the existence (until comparatively recently) of easier opportunities for high profits in the oligopolitically organised trade and finance sectors. These sectors were «closed and rigid at the lower levels, and open to foreign and diaspora financial networks at the top» (p. 235). Ithink that, both substantively and methodologically,the volume as a whole

constitutes a very significant contribution to the economic history of modern Greece. Onthesubstantivelevel,thesynthesisingchaptersoftheeditor,andthe more focused papers of the other contributors give us a highly refined and subtle image of the nineteenth-century Greek economy, of its structure, functioning, and long-term transformation. The combination of overall synthesis with specific analysis on key issues is an excellent device for bringing to life dry statistical tables and econometric computations. It allows the reader to get a sense of the social fabric, of the complex networks and configurations that lie behind growth indexes and other types of quantitative data. I believe that the link between the nature offinancial networks and the weak and lopsided industrial development that Greece experienced in the nineteenth century has been convincingly established. Although in very broad terms, the establishment of suchalinkisnota new venture, examination ofthe detailed and highly complex mechanisms which, on different levels of analysis, connect financial strategies with Greece’s industrialising project, does constitute an original contribution of Banquiers, usuriers etpaysans. My only reservation, in terms of substantive issues, relates to the volume’s more or less implicit assumption that Greece’s «failure» to industrialise in the nineteenth century, and her lopsided industrial growth during the first decades of the twentieth, was due primarily to the strategies of those who possessed liquid funds and/or controlled the highly oligopolistic financial networks. This seems to argue (as do the very concepts of «failure» and of «strategies») that there was a serious possibility for an alternative development, one nearer to that
experienced by Western Europe several decades earlier. I do not think that such an alternative was possible in Greece, and the reasons for this are partly provided by Dertilis himself. Since merchants and financiers found industrial investments far less lucrative than financial or commercial ones, there was no chance whatsoever that, if left to themselves (as they were), they could have adopted an alternative strategy. I do think that, despite Kostis’ misgivings concerning Gerschenkron’s overall theory, ? the latter was right in arguing that latecomers can only «catch up» with early industrialisers if helped by massive State intervention which, via its control ofthe banking system or in more direct Ways, channels investments into the right sectors. Was this a real possibility in nineteenth and early twentieth- century Greece? Given the structure of the Greek state, I think not. In fact, not only in Greece, but in all semi-peripheral and peripheral countries that tried to industrialise a century later than the West, the obstacles to a

more balanced, less lopsided development were so great, and the state structures so unsuitable for overcoming such obstacles, that all of them show a similar pattern of industrial «failure». From this perspective it is not surprising that among the «late-late» comers, ? the only two native states that managed to develop competitive industrial sectors and to overcome quite successfullythe difficulties that Greek industrialists were faced with, are South Korea and Taiwan. Both of them gave exceptionally effective massive aid in the industrialising process,andtodirectprivateinvestmentsintotherightsectors without killing capitalistinitiative. The Greekstate, as well as the Greek banking system that it controls, was not only unable in the nineteenth century to intervene in such a flexible and imaginative manner, but it is equally unable to do so in the twentieth. The above considerations in no way invalidate Dertilis’ analysis of labour shortages and ofthe anti-independence Greece. They simply suggest that, given the timing of Greek industrialisation (in relation to the West) and the nature of the Greek state, the alternatives available to the country during the period under consideration were more restricted than some ofthe contributors to the volume seem to imply. With regard to the methodological aspects of the book, finally, I think that the attempt to explore Greece’s financial networks by studying them at different levels ofanalysis (from the village and the region to the national and international levels) not only provides a good many insights into the constitution and transformation of financial markets, but it also suggests ways of bridging the «micro» and «macro» approaches in the social sciences. Moreover, Dertilis’ insistence that in the nineteenth-century relatively open Greek economy, national frontiers are not always a reliable guide for demarcating the areas to be studied, and that financial networks were cutting across such boundaries, is a highly promising methodological insight that deserves further development. For all of the above reasons I think that Banquiers, usuriers et paysans constitutes a veryimportant and decisive constribution to Greekeconomichistory, and that it will certainly become a valuable guide to both students and scholars of nineteenth-century Greek society and economy.
