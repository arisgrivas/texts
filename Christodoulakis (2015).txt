The Collapse in Interwar Greece
A historical episode that is frequently used by the proponents of Grexit is the abandonment of the Gold Exchange System in 1932, after which Greece devalued the currency and defaulted on its obligations. The popular assumption goes that the economy rebounded strongly afterwards, so that a similar prospect may be within reach after Grexit. This chapter describes several economic indicators to show that the consequences of the 1932 debacle were a lot more painful than assumed. In fact, it was only the tiny industrial production that benefitted from currency collapse, while the predominant agricultural sector suffered abject poverty.
7.1. THE HOPE IN INTERWAR GREECE
In an effort to provide some historical basis to the argument in favour of Greece having its own independent currency, some analysts try to present the 1932 crisis and the country’s abandonment of the Gold Standard during the interwar period as a one-way option, which promptly led to the revival of the Greek economy. Correspondingly, the present-day argument is that a similar revival will occur in the wake of a Grexit. The historical facts, however, are quite different, since the 1932 exit neither was a one-way option nor had any spectacular results for the economy of Greece or the other countries of the periphery. As a matter of fact, in the first years following its departure from the system, unemployment soared, poverty spread to the largest parts of the population, and the country entered a prolonged period of destabilization. The economy showed substantial signs of recovery only after 1936, following the establishment of a right-wing dictatorship and the harsh imposition of a

wage containment mechanism. These aspects are very conveniently overlooked by those in favour of a large devaluation today.
7.1.1. Winning and losing
The 1920s were one of the most tumultuous periods in the history of the modern Greek state, severely damaging national pride, stretching social relations and disrupting the country’s integration in the international system. Exactly one century after the War of Independence from Ottoman Turkey, Greece was on a path of national renaissance, thinking and acting as a budding European power after the Treaty of Sevres in 1920 had awarded Greece with new areas in the north including Eastern Thrace. It was the country ‘lying on two continents and surrounded by seven seas’. But three years later came the Asia Minor disaster, with the sacking of Smyrna and the mass ethnic cleansing of Greek populations by the Young Turks. The Lausanne Treaty of 1923 erased most of Greece’s territorial gains from her participation in the First World War and the country once again became a tangle of political conflict and social misery.
7.1.2. The Post-1922 Economic Collapse
In turn, political instability led to further economic decline and unstoppable social outbreaks. The exorbitant military expenditures of the previous years could no longer be serviced either by internal borrowing or by resorting to foreign lenders. The cost of borrowing shot up above 26%, four times higher than wartime interest rates. Domestic capital fled to London banks, while foreign markets shied away from a defeated and insolvent state. Public debt reached 100% of GDP—a very high level for that period—while interest and principal payments became a noose around the Greek economy. In 1927, they exceeded 10% of GDP, soaking up an increasing portion of tax revenues, which also plummeted because of the overall chaos. The state was totally unable to find the resources required for restoring the economy, and nolens volens resorted to the only available option: it printed copious quantities of money, leading to the total depreciation of the drachma. In 1923, the value of the drachma against the British pound and the US dollar was reduced sixteenfold as compared to the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the First World War.1 Since most of the debt was owed abroad, its servicing became even more unbearable after the rapid devaluation of the drachma. Soon, the economy was ensnared in high inflation and massive unemployment. In the two years of the 1922–1923 debacles, inflation rose to 150%. As a result of the high inflation, the purchasing power of real wages evaporated, and the poorer social strata were driven into despair. The ranks of the unemployed were further augmented by the arrival of refugees, as well as

demobilized soldiers from the Asia Minor front,2 creating an explosive situation in the labour market. As a result of the riots that ensued, the General Confederation of Labour was outlawed in 1923, albeit this did not put an end to social unrest, which became even more acrimonious. The extensive fragmentation of arable land, due to repeated allotment policies, played a decisive role in keeping agricultural production and farming income at persistently low levels. Neither did manufacturing manage to pick up the benefit of successive devaluations, since production was constrained by the inadequacy of domestic demand, while businesses could not grow and stand up to international competition due to lack of investment capital.
7.1.3. Reintegration in the International System
This created an urgent need for the wholesale restructuring of the economy, as well as for dealing with the country’s aggravated social problems before they led to a total collapse. Both tasks required new resources, either for financing development projects or for establishing tolerable living conditions for the refugees. Naturally, top priority was given to the country’s reintegration in the international system, with the aim of restoring domestic stability and attracting the requisite foreign capital. The dominant international system of that time was the Gold Exchange Standard. It was re-instated by the Genoa Conference in 1922 to replace the pre-war Gold Standard and came into force the following year, when a wave of hyperinflation swept Germany, threatening to contaminate other economies. Soon, the Gold Exchange Standard became the self-evident stabilization option and the indispensable mechanism for seeking funds in international markets. Greece’s economy was too weak to rush in, but Britain’s entry in 1925 increased the urgency for two reasons: First, because the majority of its creditors were based in the City of London and would, therefore, view Greece’s participation as a ‘seal of approval’ and a guarantee for the repayment of their loans.3 Second, because an economic alignment with Britain could also create the conditions for a strategic rapprochement with the main powers. This would facilitate the restoration of Greece’s role in the geopolitical scene, which had so ingloriously been ended by the defeat in Asia Minor.
7.2. RISE AND FALL, AGAIN
7.2.1. The Entry to the Gold Exchange
Soon after the 1928 elections, the Bank of Greece was established as the new financial regulator; Greece and Britain agreed on a BPS 4 million

reconstruction loan; and in May 1928 Greece joined the Gold Exchange Standard at a rate of 375 drachmas per BPS, which became the reference currency. This de facto implied an exchange rate of 77 drachmas per US dollar, as well as fixed exchange rates with the other currencies that participated in the system.4 Inflation immediately fell below 5%, exports rose and the chronic trade deficit showed some improvement. The purchasing power of wages was stabilized, and this, in turn, boosted domestic demand. Output increased, the economy came out of a prolonged recession and employment picked up. The government capitalized on this favourable environment to promote a series of remarkable economic reforms. It established the Agricultural Bank to facilitate the extension of credit to small farmers, and the Mortgage Bank to provide manufacturers with land in an orderly fashion. Taxation was restructured and revenues rose by 6% of GDP. However, as a result of the continuous increase in expenditures, this led to a minor and only temporary improvement of public deficits. The system was shocked by the 1929 Crash in the United States, which soon trapped the entire global economy in a recession. Greece had not yet been fully integrated in the international system, and thus avoided the first wave of the crisis; however, she had also not yet fully implemented the necessary structural reforms and, as a result, it was still seen as vulnerable by the increasingly restless international markets. The lack of coordination among the countries in the GES exacerbated the impact of the crisis and soon each country started pursuing beggarthy-neighbour policies. During the 1930s, the richer and more developed countries over-accumulated foreign exchange reserves in order to protect their own currencies, thus reducing global liquidity and leading the countries of the periphery to credit asphyxiation.5 This undermined every effort to reach a consensus regarding a coordinated exit from the crisis and soon forced one country after the other to abandon the Gold Standard.
7.2.2. Futile Defence and Exit
In an effort to cope with the lack of borrowing, Greece adopted strict austerity measures that deepened recession, while the decrease in international demand left no room for an export-led growth. The country’s foreign exchange reserves started falling after 1930 as a result of growing fears over a potential devaluation of the drachma, and were only temporarily stabilized when the government announced an even stricter budget for the fiscal year 1931–1932. On the international level, Greece had placed all its hopes on aligning with Britain, not only because of its dependence on London-based lenders, but also because the head of the League of Nations’ Financial Committee was a director with the Bank of England. In order to demonstrate its alignment with

Britain’s economic policy choices, in the summer of 1931 the Bank of Greece went forward with an impressive—and unfortunately fatal—act of solidarity: it converted a large part of its foreign currency reserves to pounds sterling, in order to assist the Bank of England in its own struggle to stave off severe devaluation pressures.6 Despite this unprecedented support to her ally, things soon took the worst possible turn for Greece. In September 1931, Britain unilaterally decided to abandon the Gold Exchange Standard and devalued the pound sterling by 25% against the dollar. The Greek government was thunderstruck. Not only because it had not been asked by Britain to follow suit, but also because the value of its foreign exchange reserves automatically shrank, thus further weakening Greece’s sole—and solitary—defence against speculative pressures. Although she had obviously been left behind the events, Greece ignored the oncoming speculative wave and did not join Britain in leaving the system. With profuse recklessness, she chose to maintain the drachma’s peg to the dollar at the previous rate, as if nothing had happened. Foreign exchange reserves started to plummet and within six days were reduced to half. The three emergency laws that were passed in September and October 1931 and in February 1932, imposing capital controls, proved to be nothing more but part of a panic-driven death spiral: some measures are taken, control is soon lost, and new measures are taken, until the final collapse. With reserves exhausted, the country finally yielded in April 1932 and abandoned the Gold Exchange Standard. The drachma was immediately devalued by 85% against the dollar, only to be further devalued later. At the same time, the government unilaterally defaulted on its debts, automatically causing borrowing costs to skyrocket and the country was completely shut out of international markets. And this is when a new tragic period began.
7.3. THE AFTERMATH OF DEFAULT
After the default, many people believed that the government had at last been relieved from its unbearable obligations towards its lenders, also expecting that the devaluation of the drachma would automatically restore the growth momentum of the Greek economy. In practice, though, the economy faced even more adverse conditions.
7.3.1. Domestic Recession
Soon after the devaluation, inflation started rising again leading to the immediate reduction of real wages. Although this made production more

88 Chapter 7
competitive, it simultaneously caused domestic demand to shrink, and eventually became the decisive factor, for a series of reasons: The value of agricultural production, which at that time accounted for 50% of total economic activity, suffered a severe drop: on the one hand, because prices plummeted as a result of the devaluation and, on the other hand, because international demand decreased as other countries entered recession. Industrial output increased significantly, but still was not enough to affect the overall activity, as manufacturing accounted for a mere 9% of national output.7 As a result, total economic activity fell below pre-crisis levels, and was restored only three years later. During this transition, unemployment continued to rise, as firms were sceptical of a definitive improvement in the economic climate and ceased hiring. Others were forced to shut down, because they were unable to meet the increased loan amortization payments. Barry Eichengreen, a renowned expert on that period, describes the panic that prevailed when, one after the other, Central Banks rushed to convert their foreign currency reserves to gold, thus dramatically reducing international liquidity and causing the weakest countries to asphyxiate. According to Eichengreen:8
The resulting vacuum was disastrous. The chaotic liquidation of foreign exchange reserves made credit scarce and put upward pressure on interest rates at the worst possible time, making it hard for firms to finance not only international transactions but domestic investment, as well. Disorderly exchange-rate movements disrupted trade flows, making it harder for countries to export their way out of the Depression. Nations now losing gold and foreign exchange reserves imposed capital controls that hindered foreign investment. It took years, well into the post-war period, for international trade and investment to recover to the levels that had prevailed prior to the collapse of the international monetary system. (Emphasis added).
Such effects were even more pronounced in weaker economies and Greece in particular, for which access to international credit became a lot more stringent.
7.3.2. Inability to Borrow
The country’s foreign exchange reserves remained in a dire state and only in 1934 were they, more or less, stabilized at the level they were at the beginning of 1931, when the pressure had begun. So, the drachma continued to fall, fuelling inflation and reducing purchasing power. Following the default, the state was relieved from having to make interest payments and principal loan repayments, but the large drop in incomes dragged down government revenues, and the fiscal situation showed no marked improvement.

Combined with the default, this caused financing costs to skyrocket. The cost of issuing Greek government bonds, from around 6% before the collapse, increased more than sixfold. It took several years for it to fall to 25%, just around the level in the wake of the Asia Minor disaster. The quintessence of a nation’s creditworthiness is the ability to borrow from foreign markets in its own currency. By defaulting on her external debt, Greece forfeited this option for many decades. It could still get loans, but always under a foreign currency clause, which meant that even the slightest devaluation of the drachma made debt even more unbearable. When it started resorting to domestic debt, however short-term, the cost was very high, as domestic investors wanted to be compensated both for the high inflation, and for the risk of a new default. It took more than six decades, when Greece was firmly on the path of joining the EMU, to regain the creditworthiness that was lost by the failure of 1932. The first foreign loan in drachmas was issued in 1998, in the form of ten-year fixed-rate bonds.
7.4. POLITICAL COLLAPSE
Economic hardship caused acute social unrest and led to uncontrollable political developments; this, of course, would not have happened, had the abandonment of the Gold Standard provided Greece with the growth advantage that many expected then and Grexit followers proclaim today. In contrast, the country soon entered a prolonged period of instability, strongly resembling the period that followed the Asia Minor disaster: in the four years after the collapse there were four elections (1932, 1933, 1935 and 1936), one major party abstention from voting, one attempt to assassinate the former prime minister and four coups d’état. Two of those coups were attempts to restore the Liberal Party in power, and—after failing—their leaders faced the firing squad. The third coup was royalist and led to the restoration of the monarchy through a rigged referendum. The fourth coup, in August 1936, adjourned the parliament indefinitely and imposed a right-wing dictatorship. The authoritarian regime immediately put a complete ban on industrial action, thousands of trade unionists were put in prison or sent to exile, payraise demands ceased and all parties of the Left were outlawed. This is how the wage containment mechanism that was described in chapter 6 was set up, and this is how more favourable conditions for production were established. Manufacturing activity was substantially increased both through the use of protectionist measures and defence procurement, as the drums of war sounded louder throughout Europe. However, the above was still not enough to alleviate high unemployment. To achieve this goal, the regime formed the Labour Battalions, a

semi-military formation where jobless workers and landless farmers were employed en masse at public works on a minimum wage. All this may provide a better understanding of the kind of economic ‘miracle’ that supposedly followed the currency collapse. In some developed countries, economic recovery did occur because their currencies were freed from the ‘golden fetters’ of the interwar system.9 In Greece, economic recovery was made possible thanks to the ‘iron fetters’ of the authoritarian regime.

In retrospect, the consequences of Greece exiting the Gold Exchange Standard in 1932 were dramatic, both in economic and political terms. Though participation had become untenable after the British exit in 1931, Greece was in no position to reap any serious benefits from the massive devaluation that followed and the ensuing decrease in real wages. Social protests erupted to such a degree that the political instability led to the imposition of an autocratic regime a few years later. Another example that is enthusiastically offered as a possible alternative to the current malaise in Greece is Argentina’s collapse and default in 2002. In fact, some of the shortcomings of the 1932 debacle are found to be common and equally problematic with the modern version.
