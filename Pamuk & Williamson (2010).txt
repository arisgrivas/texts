Ottoman de-industrialization, 1800–1913: assessing the magnitude, impact, and response1
By S ̧ EVKET PAMUK and JEFFREY G. WILLIAMSON
India and Britain were much bigger players in the eighteenth-century world market for manufactures than were Egypt, the Levant, and the core of the Ottoman Empire, but these eastern Mediterranean regions did export carpets, silks, and other textiles to Europe and the east. By the middle of the nineteenth century, they had lost most of their export market and much of their domestic market to globalization forces and rapid productivity growth in European manufacturing. How different was the Ottoman experience from the rest of the poor periphery? Was de-industrialization more or less pronounced? Was the terms of trade effect bigger or smaller? How much of Ottoman de-industrialization was due to falling world trade barriers such as ocean transport revolutions and European liberal trade policy, how much due to factorybased productivity advance in Europe, how much to declining Ottoman competitiveness in manufacturing, how much to Ottoman railroads penetrating the interior, and how much to Ottoman policy?

hat do we mean by the term de-industrialization? To simplify, define a country as producing only two commodities—agricultural goods which are exported and manufacturing goods which are imported, with three factors of production—labour which is mobile between the two sectors, land which is used only in agriculture, and capital which is used only in manufacturing. Assume further that our country satisfies what trade economists call the ‘small country’ assumption, and thus that it takes its terms of trade as exogenous, dictated by world markets, a condition we think applies to the Ottoman Empire. Under these conditions, de-industrialization can be defined most easily as the movement of labour out of manufacturing and into agriculture. If a country de-industrializes because its comparative advantage in agriculture has been strengthened either by productivity advance on the land, by settling more land, by increasing openness in the world economy, or by all three, then GDP increases in the short run. In the case of more land or more productive land, then the ‘small country’ faces no change in its terms of trade.2 In the case of increasing

The ‘large’ country conditions probably began to apply to Egypt and its cotton exports after the 1860s, but Egypt is not included in our Ottoman Empire definition.

openness, the country enjoys an unambiguous terms of trade improvement as declining world trade barriers raise export prices and lower import prices in the home market.3 Whether real wages in towns and living standards in villages also increase depends on the direction of the terms of trade change, whether the export commodities include foodstuffs, and whether foodstuffs dominate the budgets of poor families. That is, it depends on whether the export commodities are wheat, barley, and tobacco (a big share of the worker’s budget) or silk and opium (a small share). Whether GDP growth rates rise in the long run depends on whether industry generates accumulation and productivity externalities that agriculture does not. If industrialization is a carrier of growth, as most growth theories imply,4 then de-industrialization could lead to a growth slowdown and a low-income equilibrium that gives the notion of de-industrialization its power in the historical literature. This article documents Ottoman experience with its terms of trade over the century 1800–1913, explores the connection between de-industrialization and those external price trends, and then compares this experience with that of the rest of the eastern Mediterranean, as well as with Asia, Latin America, and the European periphery. Section I sets the stage by reviewing Ottoman experience with trade policy, world transport costs, Ottoman railroads, and thus with world market integration. Section II reviews the de-industrialization debate as it applies to the Ottoman Empire and the rest of the eastern Mediterranean, while section III assesses the de-industrialization evidence. Section IV reports the external terms of trade estimates for the Ottoman Turkish and Balkan core, for the Levant in the Empire’s eastern wing, and for Egypt, which was more autonomous. Section V discusses the economics of de-industrialization, while section VI seeks to answer the following questions: how much of Ottoman de-industrialization was due to falling world trade barriers—transport revolutions and European liberal trade policy—and how much due to factory-based productivity advance in Europe, how much to changing Ottoman competitiveness in manufacturing, and how much to Ottoman policy?
I
The Ottoman Empire covered a large part of the eastern Mediterranean for most of the nineteenth century. Around 1820, it stretched from present-day Bosnia in the western Balkans through central and northern Greece, Macedonia, Bulgaria, and Turkey to Syria, Lebanon, Palestine, and Iraq. Romania was formally part of the Empire until the middle of the century and Egypt was until the First World War, but we choose to exclude them as they had different endowments, commodity specialization, and significant autonomy. The 1820 population of the Empire (excluding Romania and Egypt) was around 21 million or about 2 per cent of the world population. The Empire experienced significant territorial losses in the Balkans throughout the century, but the Ottoman 1880 population (excluding the two same areas) was still around 21 million. On the eve of the BalkanWars in 1912,

the total population of the Empire had increased to about 25 million which equalled about 1.5 per cent of the world population. In response to the influx of cheaper manufactured goods from Britain and the rest of western Europe, de-industrialization was the norm for most periphery countries during the nineteenth century, including the Ottoman Empire.The great Middle East scholar Issawi placed the Ottoman case in this general context:
‘The Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars gave the region a respite, but in the 1820s and 30s it was hit by the full blast of European competition. Factories were pouring out cheap goods, and peace and increased security in the Mediterranean and improvement in shipping made it possible to land them at low costs. To this should be added the effects of the various commercial treaties, which froze import duties at low levels and opened up the region’s markets’.5
Thus, the 1838 Treaty is one of the most widely discussed events pertaining to the ‘collapse’ of Ottoman industry in the nineteenth century, although liberal Ottoman reforms began to appear earlier in 1826. Most European industrial countries were still protectionist before they went liberal in the 1860s,6 but Britain went open decades earlier. Indeed, Britain’s agenda was to sign free trade agreements with as many periphery countries as possible in order to gain foreign markets for their manufactures.7 The 1838 Anglo-Turkish Commercial Convention was one such commercial agreement. The original treaty was signed in Balta Liman in August of 1838 and went into effect in March of 1839. The ‘AngloTurkish convention eventually became the basis of practically all foreign trade in Turkey’ as the Ottoman Empire signed similar treaties with several other European countries in the following three years.8 This Convention was viewed as the next step in the Empire’s transition to economic liberalism after the sultan eliminated the Janissary corps in 1826. These urban guildsmen, on the military payroll, were the strongest advocates of protectionism.9 The 1838 Treaty eliminated all local monopolies, allowed British merchants to buy goods anywhere in the Empire, and exempted foreign (but not domestic) merchants from an 8 per cent internal customs duty that had been levied previously on goods transported within the Empire.10 Export duties were raised from 3 to 12 per cent and import duties from 3 to 5 per cent.11 One of the present authors has argued previously that the importance of these treaties has been overstated since they did not represent a drastic revision from the liberal course already set in 1826.12 Quataert seems to agree: ‘Commerce between [Britain and the Ottoman Empire] already was increasing dramatically: British exports to the empire had doubled in value during the late 1820s and doubled again before 1837’.13

Export duties are a tax on trade and thus offer partial relief to import-competing industries. It appears that the literature has failed to appreciate this fact, since it offers no explicit assessment of its impact.

However, by locking the government into fixed import duties, these treaties did prevent the Ottomans from providing any subsequent protection to domestic industry. Indeed, between 1865 and 1905, average tariff rates were fairly stable at 7.5 per cent in the Empire. These low ‘revenue-producing’ tariffs were consistent with free trade policy, and they were equivalent to those prevailing in Asia. In contrast, average tariff rates in protectionist Latin America and the US were about 30 per cent in the middle of the period, or more than four times that of the Ottoman Empire.14 It may seem odd that the literature never mentions political pressure exerted by export interest groups who, after all, stood to gain significantly from the treaties, and how they came to overwhelm import-competing interest groups, when the opposite was true of Latin America and the US. While this article does not offer any new evidence on this issue, one can imagine that the difference might have been attributed to two factors. First, the export-oriented agricultural producers were not well organized in the Ottoman Empire, but they were in Latin America and the US. Second, the Ottoman government signed the free trade treaties in order to obtain the political support of Britain against the threats from Russia and Mohammed Ali of Egypt, not because of pressure from export interests. Such land-based threats from major powers were absent in Latin America (except for Mexico) and the US.The elimination of monopolies also had a powerful short-run impact on de-industrialization, as we shall see in section III. The move to free trade and the dramatic decline in transportation costs contributed to a boom in Ottoman trade during the nineteenth century, especially with western Europe.15 Imports increased from £5.2 million in 1840 to £39.4 million in 1913, at about 3.3 per cent per annum, and since ‘the prices of the traded commodities were considerably lower on the eve of World War I than in 1840, the increases in trade volumes were actually greater’.16 Between 1840 and 1873, trade grew even faster, with the volume doubling every 11 to 13 years.17 Placed in a comparative framework with other periphery countries:
‘[the] Ottoman-center trade grew faster than the periphery-center trade (from the 1820s) until the early 1870s, but the rate of growth of Ottoman exports lagged behind the rate of growth of total exports from the periphery after the 1870s . . . for the period 1840–1913 as a whole, per capita exports from the Ottoman Empire expanded at rates close to but lower than those of per capita world trade and per capita center-periphery trade’.18
We note therefore that trade grew faster before 1870 than after. Steamships and railroads constitute the two major transport innovations that contributed to the booming Ottoman trade during the period. Steamships could be built much larger than their sail counterparts and their rise to dominance lowered freight costs and stimulated trade for the region. Steamers were introduced into the eastern Mediterranean in the late 1820s, and they became a

common sight after the 1840s. Indeed, all sea-going countries established ‘steamship companies between the 1830s and the 1850s, which competed for cargo . . . transportation in the Mediterranean’.19 More to the point, the freight factor on wheat fell by nearly 80 per cent on London imports from the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.20 The decline in freight rates between 1870 and 1914 was just as dramatic on routes involving Black Sea and Egyptian ports as it was in the Atlantic, perhaps even more so.21 Shipping and trade boomed in the Mediterranean. For example, shipping tonnage entering Beirut went from 40,000 in 1830, to 600,000 in 1890, and to 1,700,000 in 1913. Other cities in the eastern Mediterranean show similar shipping tonnage increases.22 Over the nineteenth century as a whole, the Ottoman Empire was more active in world trade than either Asia or Africa, but less so than Latin America.Why? Did the Ottoman Empire undergo more dramatic improvements in its terms of trade than did Asia and Africa, but less dramatic than Latin America? Thus, did it undergo greater de-industrialization than Asia and Africa, but less than Latin America?
II
De-industrialization is defined as curbing production and factor employment in manufacturing, either in factories or in cottage industries. In the simple two-sector model set out in the introduction, de-industrialization can be gauged as the movement of labour out of manufacturing and into agriculture, either measured as a fall in the total employment share, or as a fall in absolute numbers. Both measures could, in theory, also be constructed for value added, but such evidence is almost impossible to find for the nineteenth-century periphery. Alternatively, absolute de-industrialization can be supported by information on the capital stock in manufacturing, such as the number of looms and spindles. In any case, de-industrialization is easy enough to define. However, the debate over the magnitude of de-industrialization, its causes, and its economic impact is more important and contentious.23 The literature dealing with Ottoman and Middle Eastern nineteenth-century de-industrialization exhibits a fair amount of solidarity, yet the de-industrialization narrative is usually supported only by qualitative accounts, anecdotal evidence, or spotty time series, making long period quantitative analysis difficult. As if to provoke more and better work, 25 years ago Kurmus ̧ commented that anecdotal evidence was being ‘accepted as constituting some part of the historical truth’

23 Quataert, ‘Age of reforms’, p. 898, cites the Indian de-industrialization literature in pointing out terminological problems: ‘Some India scholars suggest that the term [de-industrialization] be abandoned altogether because its meaning is not clear. They argue that there are too many holes in the data to support the level of generalization that use of the term implies’. We disagree. Labels are useful for narratives, but theory and measurement are the keys to understanding the de-industrialization experience, regardless of descriptive labels.

which would serve ‘to substitute antiquarianism for scientific work’.24 Kurmus ̧’s challenge produced a response by one of the current authors whose book will be used extensively in this survey.25 Still, the previous debate has rarely been engaged in comparative terms. How did the Ottomans perform relative to the rest of the nineteenth-century poor periphery?Where the performance was different, why was it different? As is true with the de-industrialization literature on other parts of the nineteenth-century poor periphery, Ottoman industry has too often been considered solely as capital-intensive, large-scale, urban, factory production since those were the modes of production in Britain and the rest of Europe by mid-century. This is a mistake when analysing the Ottoman Empire and the rest of the periphery during the nineteenth century (or even Britain before 1780), when most manufacturing was labour-intensive, small-scale, household-based, and rural. Indeed, ‘Mechanized factory output was and remained relatively insignificant in the nineteenth century when compared with domestic and handicraft production’.26 Since cotton spinning and hand weaving were performed part-time by family members using extremely simple technology, it may seem implausible to argue that the demise of local textile production destroyed a nineteenth-century Ottoman platform for modern industrialization.Yet economic historians assign the same importance to home-based cotton spinning and weaving in Britain: ‘protoindustrial’ cottage industries are said to have supplied the platform for the factorybased British industrial revolution that followed in the late eighteenth century.27 Furthermore, employment of women and children was central to the process then too.28 Hence, this article will consider both cottage and factory industry in the Ottoman Empire, even though the data are often sparse for the former. Finally, it might be argued that the Ottoman Empire was more heterogeneous than was much of the rest of the poor periphery, primarily due to geography.Thus, given high pre-railroad, land-based transport costs, the impact of globalization was far greater on the Ottoman coast than in its interior, and far greater in its lowlands than in its mountains.While this article deals with Empire aggregates and averages, throughout the reader will be reminded of this regional heterogeneity especially prior to the railroads.
III
The traditional view of Ottoman manufacturing is that it steadily collapsed in the wake of the influx of European manufactured goods. The Napoleonic Wars had disrupted international trade and shielded the eastern Mediterranean from the impact of the industrial revolution. However, local textiles began to retreat soon after the wars ended in 1815. The western provinces of the Empire, the Balkans, and western Anatolia were first to face the impact of imports. It is clear, for example, that the strong manufacturing activity in Thessaly in central-northern

Greece reached its peak in the 1810s.29 Consular and travellers’ reports are riddled with anecdotal accounts relating the demise of industry.30 Certainly deindustrialization did occur between about 1815 and 1860, and in response to three forces. First, the end of the Napoleonic Wars opened up the gates for British exports of manufactures. Britain had already accumulated productivity advantages in manufacturing, and peacetime conditions made it possible for the leading European economy to exploit them in world markets. Second, additional rapid productivity advance in British manufacturing increased its competitive edge in foreign markets still further. Third, the move to liberal policies in the Ottoman Empire between the 1830s and the 1850s deepened the de-industrialization shock still further. After all, the terms of trade soared between 1815 and the late 1850s (figure 1), and it more than doubled over the two decades after the late 1830s. It increased by 2.6 times between 1800 and 1860 (table 2). The Ottoman Empire was completely self-sufficient in cotton and woollen textiles until about 1820, but the deluge of cheap European industrial goods changed all of that. Pamuk reconstructs the decline of Ottoman cotton textiles by using an identity to estimate the domestic consumption and production of

textiles for the areas within the 1911 borders of the Empire—Macedonia, present-day Turkey, greater Syria, and Iraq.31 He identifies the period from the 1820s to the mid-1870s as the crucial one for the decline of cotton handicrafts, a result consistent with the fact that the biggest terms of trade improvement took place in this period, as we shall see in sections IV, V, and VI. Weavers suffered, but domestic spinning also declined dramatically in the face of import competition: spinning output ‘fell from 11,550 tons per year in 1820–2, to 8,250 tons in 1840–2, to 3,000 tons in 1870–2’.32 Note that the biggest collapse in local spinning output was between 1840/2 and 1870/2 (74 per cent), not between 1820/2 and 1840/2 (29 per cent), an observation consistent with the fact that the external price shock was much bigger after the 1830s (figure 1).33 In Syria, in the eastern wing of the Empire, de-industrialization forces hit hard too.34 Aleppo was estimated to have had 40,000 handlooms in the eighteenth century, while the numbers were down to 25,000 in the 1820s—a 37 or 38 per cent fall from the eighteenth-century highs, and averaged 5,125 between 1838 and 1850—an 80 per cent fall from the 1820s. Damascus was estimated to have had 34,000 handlooms in the eighteenth century, while the numbers were down to 12,000 in the 1820s—a 65 per cent fall from the eighteenth-century highs, and averaged 2,355 between 1838 and 1850—an 80 per cent fall from the 1820s. One wonders how much of the decline between the eighteenth century and the 1820s can be attributed to competition from modern British factories after 1815 and the peace, and how much of it can be attributed to the late eighteenth century when Britain, before the factories, began to take over the Atlantic and European market from India, the Middle East, and other competitors.35 In any case, we note again that de-industrialization was dramatic up to about 1860, and so too was the terms of trade boom. One exception to this clear and strong de-industrialization pattern was the upland, mountainous areas of Ottoman Bulgaria, where woollen cloth production for local consumption and to some extent for urban markets in the neighbouring areas of the Empire survived, partly due to the barriers of geography and scarcity of good agricultural land and partly due to reasons of climate since the Bulgarian population favoured woollen over cotton textiles to a much greater degree than the rest of the Empire. Thus, small-scale proto-industrial production of woollen cloth production continued to rise until the 1870s, as Palairet emphasizes in his important research.36 This was no modest regional exception, since the population of Bulgaria was about 2.5 million or 12 per cent of the total Empire around the middle of the nineteenth century, but it is an exception that lasted until the 1860s. As Palairet makes clear, commercial production of woollen cloth in
31 Pamuk, Ottoman Empire and European capitalism, pp. 113–26, 191–4, for the details of the reconstruction. 32 Ibid., p. 118. 33 Even if we follow Quataert’s suggestion (‘Age of reforms’, pp. 905–7) and raise the estimates for local spinning in 1870–2, the decline in overall production is clear and the half century before the 1870s remains by far the most important period of declining Ottoman manufacturing activity. 34 Issawi, Fertile crescent, p. 374. 35 Clingingsmith and Williamson, ‘De-industrialization’. 36 Palairet, Balkan economies, pp. 66–84. Since Bulgaria was the industrial powerhouse of the empire before the 1870s, its loss after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–8 (and subsequent Ottoman tariffs on Bulgarian imports) may have given stimulus to the industries of the remaining territories, but this possibility is not explored here.

Bulgaria declined by more than 40 per cent from the 1860s to the first decade of the twentieth century.37 Table 1 offers another de-industrialization indicator for the nineteenth-century Ottoman Empire, where comparisons with the rest of the Third World are offered. For four Third World regions—Mexico, the Ottoman Empire, India, and Indonesia—we measure the loss of domestic textile manufactures markets to foreign imports. That is, the figures report the share of domestic consumption supplied by local and foreign sources. Take India first. It has been estimated (not in table 1) that Bengal exported about 21 per cent of its domestic production in 1750.38 That figure had fallen, at least for India more generally, to 6 or 7 per cent by 1800. Thus, even before the onset of the factory-led industrial revolution in Britain, India had lost a large chunk of its export market. By 1833, India had lost all of its (net) export market and 5 per cent of its domestic market. By 1877, the de-industrial damage was done, with domestic producers claiming only 35–42 per cent of their own home market. Although the Ottoman Empire did not have a large foreign market to lose, it underwent a similar dramatic collapse in its home market share, domestic producers undergoing a fall in their share from 97 to 25–35 per cent over the half-century between the 1820s and the 1870s. It fell again after the 1870s, but at a much slower rate, from 25–35 to 20–26 per cent.The decline in the Indonesian (or Dutch East Indian) textile industry was only a little less spectacular than in the Ottoman Empire since the local producers’ share of the home market fell from 82 to 38 per cent between 1822 and 1870. However, in the case of the Dutch East Indies de-industrialization persisted much longer, with the local producer share falling still further to about 11 per cent in 1913. Finally, Mexico seems to have resisted these de-industrialization forces more successfully, since domestic producers could still claim 60 per cent of its home market in 1879.39 In short, the

Ottoman Empire had one of the more dramatic de-industrialization episodes, although it should be stressed that these calculations apply to cotton textiles only and that they exclude Bulgaria. From the 1870s or 1880s until the First World War, the rapid decline in textile manufacturing slowed down across the Empire and it may have been even reversed in some areas despite low tariff barriers up to the First World War. Symmetrically, the rapid growth in imports from Europe also slowed down.40 For the Empire as a whole, hand spinning continued to decline but the volume of weaving probably doubled between 1880 and the First World War. One can also discern some differences during this period between the western and eastern parts of the Empire with respect to the arrival of new technology. In Bulgaria and Macedonia (including the Salonica region), factory production of yarn and cloth began to grow in the 1880s, followed a little later by the Istanbul region.41 In addition to the factory production of cloth, small-scale weavers in these areas began to use the yarn produced by the new domestic mills as well as the imported yarn to produce cloth. Factories with power-driven machinery were more limited in the eastern half of the Empire, in eastern Anatolia, Syria, and Iraq. In these areas, increases in textile manufacturing occurred primarily in weaving in small-scale urban workshops which began to use imported yarn to expand their output of cotton and mixed cotton cloths to meet local demand.42 Significant amounts were shipped to longdistance markets in Anatolia, Syria, and Egypt. Indeed, the handloom numbers in both Aleppo and Damascus show no trend at all between 1860 and the First World War, after a long secular decline.43 In the rural areas, hand spinning continued to decline but the decline of hand weaving slowed down and may have been even reversed in some areas. In short, we observe that de-industrialization forces were powerful up to the 1860s but weaker thereafter. This pattern applies to both the western and eastern halves of the Empire, even though the emergence of textile factories with powerdriven machinery was stronger in the west. This slowdown if not reversal of de-industrialization is consistent, as we shall see, with the reversal in terms of trade trends, from a rise up to the mid-late nineteenth century to a gradual fall thereafter, when the relative price of manufactures rose, thus giving local industry some relief. Not all industries were damaged by foreign competition, however. Due to an increased world demand, carpet making, copper work, earthenware, inlaid woodworking, lace making, silk reeling, and embroidery were able to thrive despite foreign competition and trade liberalism.44 Indeed, some of the above industries, and even the textile industry itself, persisted until the First World War and after.45 Some have argued that Pamuk may have overstated the extent to which handicrafts suffered. Quataert thinks he understated hand-spun yarn production, and

thus that his estimates of domestic production and consumption of cotton textiles must be in error. Hence, Quataert suggests that handspinning ‘remained an important source for Ottoman textile producers and accounted for a considerable proportion of all cotton yarn being used in the empire, at least 25 per cent in c.1900’.46 While he also claims that Pamuk’s reconstruction of the cotton textiles decline does not account for the fact that imported yarn and cloth may have created new domestic jobs, Quataert fails to offer any explicit revision of Pamuk’s reconstruction, nor is Quataert explicit about the size of the demise of local textile production in the face of foreign competition. Thus, we will stick to Pamuk’s estimates and the overall decline they suggest with the exception of an upwards revision in the volume of local spinning. Still, although the domestic import-competing industry suffered, why was it able to survive the foreign competition? There are a number of hypotheses suggested in the literature. First, perhaps foreign goods were not able to penetrate into regions distant from major trade routes or ports, especially before the railway boom late in the century. Ottoman geography, including the mountainous areas of Bulgaria, offered some protection to local industry, just as it did in the Latin American interior.47 This pre-modern geographic environment is especially relevant because it speaks to the impact of the transport breakthroughs that occurred in much of the Middle East very late in the century. Denser rail networks and more navigable waterways and roads lowered transportation costs, and these created price convergence and internal trade.48 Thus, since European imports could not be brought cheaply into the more remote areas of the Empire during most of the century, domestic manufactures could still supply local demand in those parts of the interior. High transportation costs also provided considerable protection to domestic producers of bulky, non-textile goods from import competition even in some coastal areas. Second, domestic tastes afforded Ottoman handicrafts some staying power. Although British companies attempted to imitate Ottoman styles, often they could not do so satisfactorily, and thus there was still demand for domestic cloth, including cotton, woollen, and mixed varieties of cloth.49 Their knowledge of local preferences helped domestic manufactures survive in the short run, and the import of foreign techniques and foreign managers increased their efficiency and competitiveness in the longer run. For example, local textile makers eventually became more familiar with synthetic dyestuffs which allowed them to import plain cloth and take advantage of lower-priced Ottoman labour to dye it.50 Third, Issawi argues that ‘weavers were able to cut their costs greatly by using imported yarn; thus the Industrial Revolution, which had wiped out the spinners, gave the weavers a precarious reprieve’.51 This effect worked through changes in the relative prices of local and imported yarn and cloth and was important in both the western and the eastern halves of the Empire after the 1870s, as we have shown.

potential explanation also seems promising, namely, that the late nineteenthcentury resistance of Ottoman handicrafts can be explained by the fact that the terms of trade moved against the Ottomans between 1873 and 1896. This relative price trend reversal may have afforded import-competing sectors, like local handicrafts, some relief. For all of these reasons, domestic handicrafts and industry, although badly hurt by foreign competition in the first half of the nineteenth century, resisted and adapted in the second half of the nineteenth century and in the early twentieth century. Large capital-intensive factories were not common in the Ottoman Empire, nor would they have made much economic sense given the factor endowments of the region.52 There were, however, two waves of Ottoman factory building during this period. The first wave occurred before the treaties, consisting of state-owned factories like Mohammed Ali’s prototype establishments in Egypt, and, to a lesser extent, like those of Mahmoud II around Istanbul. While they were protected by monopolies from the beginning, these factories ‘suffered from great inefficiencies, including lack of fuel and metallic raw materials and the total absence of skilled labour’.53 They were also poorly managed with military elite serving as supervisors, rather than young men that had been technically trained in Europe. In addition, these factories had dilapidated machinery and inadequate power sources, both of which would have been very expensive to remedy.The liberal treaties assured these factories a short life, but Owen believes that they would have been forced to shut down even in the absence of free trade.54 The second wave ensued after the 1870s and consisted of factories funded and operated by private interests, and which received little or no financial support from the state. It might be useful to emphasize once again that there was a difference in this respect between the western and eastern halves of the Empire, and it applied to both textile and non-textile manufacturing. The rise of the factories was stronger in the west, from Bosnia to Macedonia and Bulgaria and later in the Istanbul region. For Anatolia and the Middle East, Quataert states that these factories expanded rapidly in number, but Issawi and Pamuk both argue that this second wave was also modest and that their production remained small compared to handicrafts.55 The latter are probably closer to the mark but that second wave certainly looks like a supply response to a much more favourable world price environment. While Turkish (no longer Ottoman) industrialization really took hold only in the 1930s,56 it might be relevant to point out that while tariffs and quotas on imports increased sharply after 1929, the terms of trade also took a nose dive, that is, the relative price of manufactures rose during that decade. Quataert proposes three additional reasons for the lack of capital-intensive industrialization in the Ottoman Empire—population density, religion, and wars.57 Population density may have fostered industry by creating local demand: the

Balkans had the greatest population density in the Empire and the most pervasive industry, while the Arab provinces were very thinly populated and had the least industry. Low population density meant small markets and high land–labour ratios meant reduced labour supply for industry. Religion may have inhibited technology transfer to the extent that Muslims, who constituted the majority of the population, may have been reluctant to adopt the ideas of Christians and Jews, who understood the technology. Finally, wars waged by the Ottomans may also have delayed potential technology transfer at a time when such assimilation would have been crucial. No hard evidence is offered in support of these three propositions. In its absence, we will explore more mundane but, we think, more promising explanations—factor endowments and the external terms of trade. There were undoubtedly many factors that contributed to Ottoman de-industrialization during the nineteenth century and the slow industrialization afterwards, but we think that the long-term trends in relative prices help explain a large part of their timing, extent, and spatial pattern.

Figure 1 plots the net barter terms of trade for the Ottoman Empire (the ratio of the price of exports PX to the price of imports PM) covering the century 1800 to 1913. The series has two parts. Pamuk has already estimated the terms of trade following 1854, so what follows stresses the extension backwards to 1800 recently constructed by the other author of the present article, and further revised in table 2.58 As it turns out, the first half of the century was the most crucial half. For comparison, figure 1 also plots Egypt, 1796–1913; the Levant, 1839–1913 (present-day Iraq, Israel, Lebanon, Palestine, Jordan, and Syria); and the Middle East region as a whole. Like most of the periphery, the Ottoman Empire specialized in the export of primary products, while importing manufactures, so between 1800 and 1854 PX refers to an unweighted average of wheat, wool, raisins plus figs, tobacco, opium, and raw silk. As appendix 1 indicates, prices for the first four are taken from US markets, the price of raw silk is from British markets, and the price of opium is from the (infamous) Calcutta market.To derive PX, these six prices are taken as an unweighted average since the share of each commodity export in total exports is not available until 1879, and those weights changed dramatically over the decades before the late 1870s. PM refers to what was primarily manufactured goods and intermediate inputs, and it is proxied by the British export price index. Between 1800 and the late 1860s, the price of British manufactured exports fell far faster than did the price of British imported primary products, swinging the terms of trade against Britain and in favour of the periphery. If PM for the Ottoman Empire moved anything like PX for Britain, then the Ottoman Empire certainly underwent an impressive terms of trade boom over the half-century before the Crimean War.59 The magnitudes were enormous: over the four decades between

However, tab. 2 explores the extent to which c.i.f. and other adjustments to PM make a difference in trends. They do, documenting an even bigger PX/PM boom up to 1860. See below, section VI.

1815–19 and 1855–9, the Ottoman terms of trade rose almost 2.6 times, for an annual rate of 2.4 per cent; even over the longer 1800 to 1860 period, which includes two decades of Napoleonic conflict and suppressed trade, it still rose by a huge annual rate of 1.6 per cent per annum. While no actual Ottoman PM time series data have been tabulated prior to 1854 to confirm these otherwise plausible PX/PM trends, qualitative evidence appears to be consistent with the implied terms of trade surge. Hence, domestic resources were pulled in to agriculture and other primary product sectors, while the glut of cheap, foreign manufactures flowed into the Empire, pushing domestic resources out of import-competing industry and perhaps even out of some non-tradable activities. Ottoman terms of trade data are of far better quality for the period 1854–1913. Between 1855–9 and 1875–9, the terms of trade fell by 27 per cent, while it did not fall at all between 1875–9 and 1893–8.60 Indeed, the surprising fact is how stable was the terms of trade over the four decades between 1875–9 and 1909–13 when it drifted up at a modest annual rate of 0.4 per cent. Furthermore, all of the pre-First World War rise took place after 1896 when the Ottomans enjoyed a 14 per cent increase in their terms of trade.
60 That is, all of the fall took place in a few years before 1875 (fig. 1).

The own wage is the nominal wage divided by the price of output in the given sector; for example, textiles or exports. C.i.f. = cost, insurance, freight. F.o.b. = free on board. Sources: Wages (of unskilled construction workers) and consumer prices are for Istanbul, and are taken from Pamuk, 500 years, tab. 4.1, pp. 72–4. Prices of Ottoman imports and exports in and after 1860 are taken from idem, Ottoman Empire and European capitalism, pp. 168–75.
For the period before 1860, prices of imported textiles are taken from Imlah, Economic elements, pp. 94–7. The import price estimates assume that, in this early period, the costs of transportation and insurance declined at least as fast as the prices of f.o.b. textiles so that the decline in the c.i.f. prices of imported textiles in Ottoman ports was at least as rapid as the f.o.b. prices in England. Freight rates actually declined faster than prices of manufactures during this period, based on the North indices cited above (n. 83). Prices of Ottoman commodity exports for the period before 1860 are based on the indices and sources discussed in appendix I. The price indices for various categories of Ottoman exports were then calculated both with and without weights, where the trade weights were guesstimates since these do not exist for this period. Since Ottoman exports were quite diversified throughout the nineteenth century, the two alternatives gave very similar results. British export price indices were then used as a proxy for Ottoman import prices, thus yielding a terms of trade series extending from 1800 to 1860; Mitchell and Deane, Abstract, p. 331, based on Imlah, Economic elements, pp. 94–7. This series was then linked to Pamuk’s Fisher index 1854–1913 series, using an arithmetic average of the seven overlapping years.

To summarize, if one is looking for evidence of a big de-industrialization impact on the Ottoman Empire, we should see plenty of it in the half-century before the late 1850s. We should see little or no evidence of de-industrialization between the late 1850s and the mid-1890s, assuming that the pre-1860 price shock had had enough time to shake out import-competing industries. Finally, we should see only very modest evidence of de-industrialization in the two decades before the First World War. Were these terms of trade trends common to all parts of the Empire? Issawi claims that the terms of trade moved in favour of the Ottomans in both Syria and Iraq between 1836 and 1913. He bases his claims concerning Syria on the prices of raw silk and cocoons prevailing in Beirut from 1836 to 1913 and on prices for some other commodities exported from Aleppo between 1891 and 1913. His claims for Iraq are based on an unweighted five-commodity index covering the period from 1864 to 1913. Issawi extrapolates both the Syrian and Iraqi terms of trade backwards, concluding that the terms of trade improved there from 1800 to 1913.61 These estimates are consistent with the de-industrialization experience in that part of the Empire: it destroyed a large part of the handicrafts both directly through competition and indirectly by turning consumers’ taste to western-type goods, without causing technology spillovers or import substitution.62 According to cotton export price series, Egypt’s terms of trade must also have risen across the nineteenth century. Issawi estimated that Egypt’s terms of trade (1880 = 100) rose from 52 in 1820–2 to 71 in 1850–2, a rate of 1 per cent per annum over the three decades, much smaller than what we have found for the rest of the Empire (2.4 per cent per annum up to 1855–9). It rises again to 107 in 1870–2, reflecting world cotton scarcity induced by the US civil war. Issawi’s index falls to 100 in 1890–2 and then rises modestly to 136 in 1908–12.63 In figure 1, we offer our own index of the terms of trade for Egypt, 1796–1913; the Ottoman Empire, 1800–1913; and the Levant, 1839–1913. The spectacular rise in the Egyptian terms of trade between 1820–4 and 1856–60, 2.7 per cent per annum, is even bigger than that of the Ottoman Empire over the same period, 2.3 per cent per annum. Since PM is the same in both cases, it is clear that cotton prices rose even more in world markets than did the Ottoman export mix of wheat, wool, fruits, silk, tobacco, and opium. In any case, these terms of trade figures imply an even greater de-industrialization impact on Egypt than on the rest of the Middle East, spelling especially bad luck for Ali’s early experiments with Egyptian industrialization. Between 1855–9 and 1875–79, the Egyptian terms of trade fell by almost 11 per cent, less than half the fall experienced by the Empire, 27 per cent, and thus, presumably, less stimulation to import-competing industry. Finally, between 1875–9 and 1909–13, the Egyptian terms of trade drifted upwards at roughly the same modest rate as elsewhere in the Middle East (0.5 versus 0.4 per cent per annum).

V
We know that a booming terms of trade contributed to Ottoman de-industrialization in the nineteenth century, and especially up to the late 1850s. That is, as export prices rose and import prices fell, labour and other resources were pulled out of industry (and non-tradable sectors) and into the export sector so as to augment its capacity. The size of these so-called ‘Dutch disease’ effects were, of course, intensified by the pro-global policies introduced between 1826 and 1838, but we think there were other domestic supply-side forces that might have diminished Ottoman competitiveness with foreign manufactures up to midcentury. We also think these forces might have reversed when the terms of trade ceased to rise after the late 1850s. During the century before the 1850s, most foodstuffs eaten by village peasants and the urban working class (like barley, rye, lentils, chick peas, beans, olive oil, cheap raisins, and figs) were not traded internationally. True, skilled artisans and better-off peasants ate wheat bread made from traded wheat, but most ate cheaper bread made from coarser grains that were not traded. Also, foodstuffs were a very large share of family budgets, somewhere between 75 and 80 per cent in the urban areas and even higher in the rural areas where 75 per cent of the population lived.64 Under those conditions, labour productivity in the non-traded part of food production must have influenced manufacturing competitiveness, as Alexander Gerschenkron, W. Arthur Lewis, and even Adam Smith argued long ago.65 Their reasoning went as follows. In a pre-industrial economy with relatively stable subsistence wages,66 any decline in Ottoman food productivity would have put upward pressure on food prices and thus on the nominal wage in manufacturing, eroding competitiveness with foreign producers. Any rise in Ottoman food productivity or increase in arable land in the interior would have had the opposite effect. However, there was another force at work too. As the Ottoman Empire became more integrated into world commodity markets, increased specialization took the form not only of rising exports of wool, silk, and opium, but also of consumer goods such as wheat, figs, raisins, olive oil, tobacco, and even barley. Any rise in the price of exported consumer goods would have put more upward pressure on the prices of local consumer goods and thus on the nominal wage, eroding competitiveness with foreign producers in import-competing sectors. This would have been manifested by rising food prices relative to other products, by falling profitability in manufacturing, and by a decline in industrial output. Which of these domestic supply-side forces dominated the Ottoman Empire, especially before the 1860s? Alternatively, was this force offset by the increase in arable land in the interior, thus lowering the price of foodstuffs, at least in the interior, and especially in a pre-railroad era? What was the net effect of all these complex forces on the relative price of food and other key consumer goods? Concern with the price of foodstuffs was used by Lewis to help explain de-industrialization in the tropical periphery.67 However, he did not offer an explicit model or supply comprehensive empirical support for his thesis.

an explicit and testable Lewis-like model was applied elsewhere in the poor periphery: the thesis worked well in helping account for the spectacular demise of Indian manufacturing in the face of British competition after 1750;68 and it also worked well in helping account for exceptional Mexican success in minimizing the damage inflicted by foreign imports on its domestic textile industry.69 There, the relationship between terms of trade booms and de-industrialization was made explicit. Here, it should suffice to offer only the bottom line: the industrial employment share should fall whenever the own wage in manufacturing (the nominal wage deflated by the price of manufactures) grows faster than the own wage in wheat and other commodity exports. Moreover, de-industrialization will be most severe when the difference in own wage growth rates is largest, and this can only result when the external terms of trade rises since the nominal wage should be similar everywhere in the domestic economy. In short, the relative size of industry should have undergone its most severe fall when nominal wage growth was strongest and when the terms of trade was shifting most dramatically in favour of wheat and other commodity exports. True, conditions were a little different in the Ottoman Empire since it was a major exporter of foodstuffs, in contrast with India and Mexico. So, how did de-industrialization economics work in the Ottoman Empire?
VI
It is certainly comforting that the evidence in table 2 is so consistent with the predictions of the previous section. First, the economics there invoked the Lewis assumption of stable real wages, and they were indeed, especially over the first 60 years of the nineteenth century: they rose by only 11 per cent between 1800 and 1880, and they fell by 8 per cent up to 1860. Second, section V predicted that a rapid rise in the own wage in manufacturing (here proxied by textiles), especially compared with the commodity export sector, would generate powerful de-industrialization forces. Indeed, the own wage in textiles soared across the nineteenth century. Furthermore, the biggest rise took place between 1800 and 1860—3.3 per cent per annum—precisely the decades of most dramatic de-industrialization. The own wage in the export sector also rose up to 1860, but by not nearly as much as textiles (0.8 versus 3.3 per cent per annum). Third, the rise in the own wage in manufacturing between 1800 and 1860 was being pushed partly by a nominal wage boom (1 per cent per annum)—accounting for a third of the own wage increase, but mostly by the collapse in manufactures prices (-2.2 per cent per annum: proxied by imported textiles)—accounting for twothirds of the own wage increase. Recall that section V predicted a nominal wage boom. Fourth, the predicted rise in food prices seems to have taken place, as the consumer price index (CPI) (dominated by foodstuffs) doubled between 1800 and 1860. The rising CPI pushed up the nominal wage by almost the same amount—confirming the predictions of Gerschenkron, Lewis, Smith, and the economics of section V, thereby diminishing Ottoman wage competitiveness in manufacturing.

Fifth, the rise in the own wage in manufacturing slowed down considerably between 1860 and 1880 to 1.5 per cent per annum—precisely the decades of a diminished rate of de-industrialization and some signs of re-industrialization. Consistent with that experience, the own wage in the export sector actually grew a little faster than it did in textiles (2.3 versus 1.5 per cent per annum). Furthermore, during these two decades the modest rise in the nominal wage (0.1 per cent per annum) accounts for only 7 per cent of the own wage increase in manufacturing, while the fall in manufacturing prices (-1.4 per cent per annum) accounts for 93 per cent.This small rise in the nominal wage is consistent with the 14 per cent fall in the CPI, the latter induced, presumably, by the 11 per cent fall in the food export price. Sixth, and finally, Lewis-like thinking loses its relevance after 1880 when the real wage rose quite impressively (0.8 per cent per annum), presumably because the rate of productivity advance in both the export and import competing sectors rose.

focuses on changes in Ottoman policy and the appearance of the railroads penetrating the interior in the late nineteenth century.70 These two changing domestic forces must be assessed against the dramatic 260 per cent increase in the external terms of trade between 1800 and 1860 (table 2). Consider first the policy impact of the Ottoman free trade treaties of 1838–41. We estimate that the initial move towards free trade raised PX/PM in the Ottoman ports and coastal cities by only 2 per cent, a trivial impact compared with the 260 per cent rise in PX/PM coming from world market forces. True, the policy impact was bigger in the interior (a 6 per cent rise in PX/PM there), but still very small. It should be added, of course, that the treaties took away tariff autonomy and severely reduced the ability of the Ottoman government to raise tariffs later in the century, making it impossible to protect domestic industry from the full force of foreign competition when the free trade damage became clearer. Ottoman tariffs were changed, albeit marginally, after negotiations with European countries while the free trade treaties were being renewed in 1861. Duties on exports were reduced from 12 per cent to 1 per cent and tariffs on imports were raised from 5 per cent to 8 per cent. These changes improved the terms of trade faced by the domestic producers by 8 per cent in both the coastal areas and in the interior. The elimination of internal tariffs in 1870 improved the terms of trade in the interior by an additional 8 per cent. These changes were, however, offset by world market conditions: Ottoman PX/PM fell by 17 per cent in world markets between 1860 and 1880 (table 2) which must have eased the de-industrialization pressures on local manufacturing. After 1880, neither the external terms of trade nor Ottoman policy changed much, so de-industrialization forces lost their destructive impact on coastal industry. Things were different in the interior, however, as the railroads opened up those markets to import penetration and exports to world markets. Table 3 estimates that the terms of trade in the interior rose by 30 per cent, as declining transport costs and the removal of the interior trade tax served to push exportable (for example, wheat) prices up to world levels and to push importable (for example, textiles) prices down to world levels.71 So, while de-industrialization forces were quiet on the Ottoman coast after 1860, they certainly were still present in the Ottoman interior.
70 The literature often fails to appreciate that it is changes in policy, transport costs, and world prices that matter, not levels. After all, de-industrialization implies a change, such as a decline in the relative or even absolute importance of manufacturing. 71 The share of transportation costs in the price of a good moved to and from the Ottoman interior varied substantially according to the good (low-value, high-bulk primary products versus high-value, low-bulk textiles, but also wheat versus other primary goods) and the distance from port. Hence, the estimates underlying tab. 3 are rough. Quataert, ‘Limited revolution’, pp. 143–54, offers an excellent discussion of this issue and some international comparisons with wheat transported on the Anatolian Railway after 1890. The cereal-growing areas in Anatolia could not send any wheat to Istanbul or Izmir, the leading ports in western Anatolia, before the railroad, but they did send some to the southern port of Mersin on the Mediterranean via camel caravans. Quataert indicates that per ton-kilometre costs in transporting Anatolian wheat to these ports by railroad were initially significantly higher than on the routes between Chicago and New York. However, he estimates that ton-kilometre charges for wheat and barley dropped across the late nineteenth century, so that they accounted for 22% of the final price in Istanbul at the end of the period. Most other export commodities produced in the interior, such as fruits, nuts, and tobacco, benefited to a smaller extent from the arrival of the railroads; Kurmu ̧s, ‘Role of British capital’. Tab. 3 summarizes this evidence by assuming that between the 1860s and 1913 the railroads by themselves lowered textile prices in the interior by about 7% and raised primary product prices in the interior by about 15%, all relative to coastal prices.

VII
The economic impact of the core on the periphery had its source in two forces that arose during the first global century.72 The first was the worldwide transport revolution that served to integrate world commodity markets.73 It caused a boom in trade between core and periphery, created commodity price convergence for tradable goods between all world markets, and contributed to a rise in every country’s external terms of trade, including the periphery. The second force came from the derived demand for industrial intermediates, like Ottoman raw silk and wool, which soared as manufacturing production led the way in the core. Thus, as core economies raised their industrial output shares, manufacturing output growth raced ahead of GDP growth. Rapid productivity growth lowered the cost and price of manufactures, and by so doing generated a soaring derived demand for raw materials in the core. This event was reinforced by accelerating income per capita growth and a high income elasticity of demand for luxury consumption goods, like Ottoman wheat, raisins, figs, and even opium. Since industrialization was driven by unbalanced productivity advance favouring manufacturing relative to agriculture and other natural-resource-based activities, the relative price of manufactures fell everywhere, especially in the periphery where they were imported. The world transport revolution made it possible for the distant periphery to supply this booming demand for primary products. Both forces produced positive, powerful, and sustained terms of trade shocks in the periphery, raising the relative price of primary products, and lowering the relative price of manufactures. This epoch stretched over as much as 70 or 80 years. Eventually these two forces abated. The rate of decline in real transport costs along sea lanes slowed down, approaching a twentieth-century steady state.74 The rate of growth of manufacturing slowed down in the core as the transition to industrial maturity was completed. As these two forces abated, the resulting slowdown in primary product demand growth was reinforced by resource-saving innovations in the industrial core, induced, in large part, by those high and rising primary product prices during the nineteenth-century terms of trade upswing. Thus, the secular boom faded, eventually turning into a secular bust. Exactly when and where the boom turned to bust depended on the export commodities in which a periphery region specialized, but the periphery peak ranged between the 1850s and the 1890s. This 130-year cycle in the periphery terms of trade is illustrated in figure 2 by Latin American experience up to 1939 (1900 = 100). The region’s terms of trade underwent a steady increase from the 1810s to the early 1890s, and, like the Ottoman Empire, the improvement was especially dramatic during the first four decades: the annual rate of increase was 1.3 per cent per annum between starting the half-decade 1815–19 and concluding the half-decade 1890–4, equivalent to almost a tripling over the 75 years; and the rate between 1815–19 and 1855–9 was even greater, about 2.1 per cent per annum. Furthermore, that increase is probably understated since it fails to take account of the likely increase in the quality of

traded manufactures relative to primary products.75 Based on the estimates underlying figure 2, the quality-adjusted terms of trade may have grown at a little more than 2.2 per cent per annum between 1815–19 and 1855–9, and at a little more than 1.4 per cent per annum between 1815–19 and 1890–4. There is no reason to expect these quality adjustments to have been any different for the rest of the poor periphery, including the Ottoman Empire. How does the terms of trade boom for the Ottoman Empire and the rest of the eastern Mediterranean compare with Latin America, Asia, and the European periphery? Figure 3 documents terms of trade performance for the five major regions in the poor periphery, between 1796 and 1913 (1900 = 100). Each region is an 1870 population-weighted average of the following components: European periphery (Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Russia); Middle East (the Ottoman Empire and Egypt); Latin America (Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Venezuela); south Asia (India and Ceylon); and south-east Asia (Indonesia, the Philippines, Siam, and Malaya). Figure 3 does not break out the country experience of which the five regions are aggregates, but the original source does.76 First and most important, the secular terms of trade boom was even bigger in Egypt and the Ottoman Empire than the rest. If we ignore the few years around 1820 when the terms of trade spikes, it appears that south Asia (and India, which dominates the regional series) underwent relatively modest improvements in its terms of trade from 1800 to the mid-1820s, and in fact fell thereafter up to 1850. Over the half-century between 1800–4 and 1855–9, India’s terms of trade rose less than 0.5 per cent per annum. No doubt this was a significant secular price shock,

but it was far smaller than what happened in Egypt, the Ottoman Empire, and the Middle East as a whole. The Latin American terms of trade increased by 1.7 per cent per annum between 1820–4 and 1855–9. The Ottoman terms of trade increased by 2.4 per cent per annum between 1815–19 and 1855–9, while the Indonesian terms of trade (which dominates the south-east Asia regional experience) increased by 2.5 per cent per annum between 1825–9 and 1865–9. The Egyptian terms of trade rose by 2.7 per cent per annum between 1820–4 and 1855–9. In short, on the secular upswing in the terms of trade shared by all regions in the poor periphery, Egypt and the Ottoman Empire underwent about the biggest increase. This implies that the eastern Mediterranean region also suffered some of the highest levels of de-industrialization and Dutch disease up to the 1860s. What went up then came down, as the terms of trade fell everywhere in the periphery from the 1870s or 1890s to the Second World War. However, it should be noted that Egypt and the Ottoman Empire reached a relatively early peak in their terms of trade, the series levelling off and even falling after the 1850s and 1860s. This implies that Dutch disease de-industrialization forces lost their power much earlier in the region than in Latin America and other parts of the poor periphery where their terms of trade continued to rise during the late nineteenth century.

APPENDIX I: OTTOMAN TERMS OF TRADE, 1800–1913
In order to extend the Ottoman net barter terms of trade back before 1854 and to link it to the beginning of Pamuk’s 1854–1913 series,77 we constructed price indices that made use of price series for six of the leading Ottoman exports taken from the following sources; wheat in Istanbul from Pamuk;78 opium in India from

Clingingsmith and Williamson;79 tobacco and raisins in Philadelphia from Bezanson et al.;80 and silk and wool from Gayer et al.81 All current prices were converted to British pounds using the nominal Ottoman kurus ̧/British pound82 and US dollar/British pound exchange rates.83 The prices of raisins, silk, and wool cited in these sources are c.i.f., so transportation and insurance costs needed to be subtracted from them in order to reach f.o.b. prices in Ottoman ports. For this purpose, we relied on the methodology and calculations undertaken by Pamuk.84 Those calculations used North for freight rates indices and Simon for insurance rates.85 We extended Simon’s 1861–1900 insurance rate trends back to 1800 assuming that insurance rates moved similar to North’s freight rates but did not decline as fast in the period before 1860.We remained on the conservative side and assumed that the difference between the c.i.f and f.o.b prices did not fall as fast as the North freight rate indices suggest. Trends in the f.o.b. series for raisins, silk, and wool obtained through these calculations were not very different from trends in the f.o.b. series for wheat, opium, and tobacco as can be seen in table 2. The price indices for Ottoman exports were then calculated both with and without weights, where the trade weights were guesstimates since these do not exist for this period. Since Ottoman exports were quite diversified throughout the nineteenth century—the share of any one commodity in the total value of exports rarely exceeding 10 per cent—the two alternatives gave very similar results.86 British export price indices were used as a proxy for Ottoman import prices, thus yielding a terms of trade series extending from 1800 to 1860.87 This series was then linked to Pamuk’s Fisher index 1854–1913 series, using an arithmetic average of the seven overlapping years.
APPENDIX II: EGYPTIAN TERMS OF TRADE, 1796–1913
Egypt’s terms of trade 1820–1913 has been constructed using only cotton prices to estimate export price trends, a reasonable assumption since cotton was Egypt’s dominant nineteenth-century export commodity, accounting for ‘one-third of exports in the 1840s–50s, over 80 per cent in the 1880s and over 90 per cent in 1910–14’.88 For the years 1820–99, Alexandrian cotton prices were used.89 For the remaining 14 years, US cotton prices were taken as a proxy for Egyptian prices.90 This US cotton price proxy was chosen because Egyptian cotton followed closely ‘world, and more particularly American, prices’.91 The series reported by Issawi gives the cotton price in dollars per qantar, so his was converted to dollars per pound in order to make it consistent with the US

series. In Egypt, the qantar was equal to 120.6135 pounds until 1835.Thus, for the period 1820–1935, the reported figures were divided by 120.6135 in order to obtain $/lb. After 1835, Egyptian qantars were equal to 99 pounds, so the reported figures were divided by that number to get $/lb.92 To obtain the real export price series, the resulting nominal price series was divided by the US consumer price index for each of the years 1820–1913 and then indexed at 1880 = 100.93 In order to derive the terms of trade series, the nominal cotton price series was divided by the price of British exports (a proxy for the price of Egyptian imports) for each year of the period.94 Although cotton was always Egypt’s dominant export commodity, it increased in importance throughout the century. Egypt’s other important exportable, wheat, held substantial export shares earlier in the century.95 In order to see if the cotton series accurately captures a more comprehensive export price index, the price of wheat was correlated against the price of Egyptian cotton.96 The correlation is very high, indicating that Egypt’s cotton terms of trade series is likely to be a good indicator of its terms of trade as a whole. However, this correlation is weaker for the earlier years of the series, when wheat occupied a greater share of export trade. The prices used here differ from those reported in Issawi’s Middle East and North Africa book, in spite of the fact that cotton price data from Issawi’s Middle East book were used for both. Judging from the numbers presented in the former, he may have failed to account for the change in the measurement of the Egyptian qantar. Nonetheless, both series show an unambiguous improvement in Egyptian terms of trade during the period. This terms of trade series, the Middle East regional aggregate (including the Ottoman Empire and the Levant: appendix I), and all other series from the poor periphery are reported by Williamson.97
