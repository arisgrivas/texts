Monetary and Fiscal Policies in Greece: 1833-1914*

1. Introduction
From 1833 — when reconstruction started — to 1914 — when the international gold standard broke down — the Greek economy experienced sharp and permanent increases in government expenditure, a continuous fall in income tax revenues as well as a persistent monetization of budget deficits. It is well known (Phelps, 1973; Barro, 1979, 1987; Mankiw, 1987; Grilli, 1988, 1989) that inflation is viewed as a public finance phenomenon. Studying the behaviour of Greek monetary and fiscal authorities across different time periods in the past, we conclude that governments largely used inflation in order to derive revenues (seigniorage) and finance their budget deficits. Ultimately, several episodes of supension of metallic convertibility took place and Greece experienced long-lived irredeemable paper currency standards. The main purpose of this paper is to present some historical perspective on the behaviour of the monetary and fiscal policies pursued in Greece during the period from the early 1830s until the collapse of the gold standard. Furthermore, the existence of reliable

data for monetary and fiscal aggregates gives us the chance to highlight the link that exists between government budget problems, fluctuations of monetary variables and exchange rate movements. It should be noted that these data are not only unpublished but also their existence is probably unknown to Greek scholars. Hence, we consider that an appendix containing the main time-series with their sources would be useful to Greek and non-Greek researchers. We proceed as follows. We divide the story of Greek monetary and fiscal policies into three parts. The first part (Section 2.1) concerns the period from 1833 to 1876. The starting point is 1833 because this year is the earliest for which we have a complete data series at least for the fiscal variables. The ending point is 1976 when bimetallism ended anda long period of irredeemable paper currency standards started. The second part of the story (Section 2.2) concerns the period from 1877 to 1909. During this period a fiat monetary system prevailed. The third part (Section 2.3) concerns the period from 1910 — when Greece adopted a gold-exchange based regime — until 1914 — when WWI broke out and the gold standard collapsed. Finally, Section 3 offers some concluding remarks while an appendix at the end of the paper contains some of the historical data.
2. The pre-WWI Period (1833-1914)
Tables 1 and 2 present the main features of the fiscal and monetary policies pursued. They reveal the existence of a close link between fiscal considerations and monetary policies. Periods of high levels of government expenditure were characterized by large seigniorage needs, sharp and divergent increases in note circulation and sharp and divergent reductions in the metallic reserves of the central bank. Moreover, linking the Drachma/French franc exchange-rate movements! with government financing decisions we can have some evidence on what caused the suspensions of metallic convertibility.
1 For the pre-WWI period we only study the Drachma/French franc exchange rate movements since the drachma was tied to the French franc, the nominal anchor of the Latin Monetary Union to which Greece belonged.

From 1828 — when for the first time a national monetary system Was introduced? — to 1832 Greece was on a silver standard. The legal tender was the silver phoenix. It was 9/10 of pure (or fine) silver and 1/10 of copper; it was equal to 3.747 grams of pure silver?. In
? Until 1828 money transactions were carried out mainly in Turkish coins and foreign
swtencies like the Spanish distilo. Greek coins did not exist. Although the phoenix was defined as equal to 1/6 of the Spanish distilo (4.511 grams ot 4.074 grams of pure silver) it weighed (perhaps by a “mistake”) only 4.163 grams (or -/47 grams of pure silver). Probably, this “mistake” was one of the main reasons for © subsequent monetary reform. (See the decree of 8 February 1833).

1831 silver convertibility was suspended and paper currency was issued to finance the budget deficits 4. Bimetallism was introduced in 1833 as a consequence of the political reform that took place (monarchy succeeded democracy). The new legal tender was the silver drachma (9/10 of pure silver and 1/10 of copper) and the gold drachma, equal to 20 drachmas, (9/10 of pure gold and 1/10 of copper). The silver drachma was fixed as equal to 4.029 grams of pure silver (and 0.448 grams of copper) and the gold drachma as equal to 0.25994 (x 20=5.199) grams of pure gold (and 0.577 grams of copper). In other words, the silver drachma contained 15.5 times as many grams of silver as ofgold. Thus, the legal ratio was 1:15.59. In 1842 the National Bank of Greece was established. It had two departments: the Issuing Department and the Banking Department. It had the exclusive privilege of banknote issue ®. At the same time, it accepted private deposits in banknotes and metallic money, and provided loans. Also, it had reserve responsibilities: it held metallic (gold plus silver) reserves in its treasury and interest-bearing deposits
4 By the decree of 17 June 1831, it was defined that the upper limit of paper money in circulation should be 3 mil. phoenix. The money transactions between the government and the private sector were to be carried out 1/3 in paper money and 2/3 in silver coins. Six months later, by the decree of 4 January 1832, it was defined that the money transactions were be carried out only in paper money. > It should be noted that due to the limited quantity of Greek circulation currency, foreign currencies were allowed by law to circulate freely in the Greek money market.(By the decree of 8 February 1833, the parities between Greek and foreign coins — 29 silver and 16 gold coins — were fixed). As a result, Greek silver and gold coins quickly outflowed since holders of foreign debased coins exchanged them for drachmas. Ultimately, the Greek money market was flooded by foreign currencies with a face value much higher than their market value. The silver drachma like the phoenix, was also tied to the Spanish distilo. Although it was defined as equal to 1/6 of the distilo, it equals only to 4.477 grams (or 4.029 gm of pure silver). In other words, the same «mistake» was made again. We should note that the distilo was mainly used in trade transactions in the Spanish Colonies in South America. It was a coin that counterfeiters could copy easily and cheaply. If we make the assumption that the monetary authorities knew that the distilo had a false market value, we can get an explanation of this “mistake”. 6 There were also three other central banks. The Ionian Bank, established in 1839, had the exclusive privilege of banknote issue in the Ionian Islands only. This privilege was withdrawn in 1920. The Bank of Epirus and Thessaly, established in 1880, had the exclusive privilege of issuing banknotes in Epirus and Thessaly. In 1899 it merged with

readily convertible into gold or silver in foreign banks abroad’. The lower limit of metallic reserves to banknote ratio was fixed at 1/4, i.e, 25% of banknotes in circulation could be readily converted into metallic coins. It becomes clear that although the National Bank acted as a commercial bank, it had all the responsibilities and privileges of a central bank.
1848-1868
Six years after the establishment of the National Bank, metallic redemption was suspended for the first time on 4 April 1848. However, that was the only time in the monetary history of Greece that the decision of suspension of convertibility was not directly related to government-financing decisions. A world-wide trade crisis occurred due to political instability in West Europe (originated in the social upheaval in France) which quickly took the form of a world-wide monetary crisis. The increased trade balance deficits caused large reserve losses. While in January 1848 35% of banknote circulation was tedeemable in gold or silver, in April the reserve banknote ratio was sharply reduced to 10%. Thus, the National Bank of Greece suspended convertibility in order to keep its metallic reserves intact. The episode of metallic inconvertibility lasted for eight months only. On 16 December, Greece reverted back to the bimetallic standard. The numerous gold discoveries in Russia, California and Australia in 1850s and 1860s depressed the market price of gold relative to silver. The Consequence was an inflow of gold and an outflow of silver. In 1865, France, Belgium, Italy and Switzerland agreed to maintain the bimetallic Standard. So, the Latin Monetary Union was established. The legal gold-silver ratio was fixed at 1:15.5 and France provided her currency as
the National Bank. The Bank of Crete, established in 1899 after the Greek-Turkish war of 1897, had the exclusive privilege of note issue in Crete. This privilege was withdrawn in 1919. Due to the limited quantity of note circulation of the other banks and mainly to the lack of data, we consider as total note circulation only the banknote circulation of the National Bank. The Bank of England, Banque de France and Reichsbank.

the common monetary unit. On 10 April 1867, Greece signed the LMU agreement but she did not adopt it until November 1882.
1869-1876
In December 1868 for the first time monetary expansion was closely related to government budget problems. A fiat monetary standard prevailed for almost two years. From 1865 a continuous increase in interest payments on domestic debt was in progress. The Crete revolution in 18688 caused an increase in military expenditure and threw some burden on the budget. Consequently, the large budget deficits and the

inability to finance them either through tax revenues (income tax over the total tax revenues ratio was reduced from 38.6% in 1868 to 30.8% in 1869) or issuing debt, forced monetary authorities to use inflation as a financing instrument ®. In July 1870 convertibility was restored and Greece reverted back to bimetallism. The Franco-Prussian War of 1870-71 brought an end to bimetallism. France lost the war and was forced to pay a huge war indemnity to Germany in funds redeemable in gold. Germany used the war indemnity to shift froma silver to a gold standarTdh.e huge German silver sales together with the discovery of a vast amount of silver in Nevada, depressed the market price of silver relative to
gold 1°, The consequence was a reversal of the movement of 1860s; an
Outflow of the gold and an inflow of silver. The continuous flood of silver coinage and convertibility threatened the economies with inflationary pressures. Hence, in 1874 the four members of the LMU agreed to limit silver coinage. In 1875 the National Bank of Greece devalued silver relative to gold in order to avoid the inflation threat. In 1876 France and Belgium prohibited silver coinage and convertibility while a year earlier Italy suspended silver coinage. Following the LMU members, Greece closed her mint to silver.
> The data for budget deficits are expressed in nominal terms rather than in real terms. This is because data for a price index do not exist. A cost-of-living price index started to io Constructed only from 1914. It is quite interesting to note that the National Bank was unwilling to finance the udget deficits through inflation. To preserve the confidence in its banknote, the Bank tefused to lend its metallic reserves and banknotes to the government, and issue 'ttedeemable paper currency. The pressing finance requirements, however, forced the 80vernment to threaten the Bank with suspension of its exclusive privilege of note issue. 1 fact, by a decree of 23 December 1868 the government announced that it was going ~ Issue paper money. As a result, there was a run on the Bank as people rushed to €deem their banknotes in metallic coins. Thus, the pressure on the metallic reserves Steed the Bank to suspend convertibility and create money. It lent the government mil. drs in metallic money and 10 mil. drs in banknotes and issued fiat money until the “Upper allowable limit of 36 mil.drs. (Valaoritis (1902, pp. 50-58) offers a description of © chronology of the conflict).

2.2 Fiat Monetary Standards (1877-1909)
1877-1885
However, Greece did not adopt the gold standard, like the other LMU members, since new government budget problems forced monetary authorities for the third time to revert back to an irredeemable paper currency standard (June 1877-December 1884). In 1876 a new period of high levels of government expenditure and thus large budget deficits started. To ensure convertibility of domestic banknotes, the government tried to avoid inflation as a tax instrument but rather incurred welfare losses in return for income tax revenues. Indeed, income taxes (as a percentage of total tax revenues) sharply increased (from 23% in 1875 to 33% in 1876) while seigniorage revenues were reduced. Considering the increase in wartime expenditures that occurred in 18771! as temporary, the government decided to finance them by issuing domestic debt . However, the ability to derive funds from domestic loans ? was limited, so the government decided to use inflation for revenue collection. Indeed, seigniorage increased to 21% while income taxes
were reduced to 30%. Therefore, Greece switched back to
a flexible-rate regime. Figure 2 plots the time-series of note circulation and metallic reserves. Note that while in the pre-1877 sub-period the two variables moved together (the episode of 1868 was so brief that it did not seriously affect the long-run time series properties of the variables), in the post-1877 period they moved in opposite directions. The upward
11 While in the 1840s the market price ratio was 1:15.83, the many gold discoveries 1n
1850s and 1860s reduced the ratio to 1:15.36 and 1:15.45, respectively. However, the .downward movement was quickly reversed by an upward one. In the first half of the
1870s the ratio increased to 1:15.98 while in the second half it sharply increased to
1:17.87. (Katselidis (1902, p. 61) and Simantiras (1905, p. 207) present the time-series data for the market price ratio during the nineteenth century).

movement of note circulation was accompanied by a downward movement of metallic reserves so that the reserve-banknote ratio was reduced at very low levels, as seen in Figure 3. It becomes apparent that a long period of fiat money had started.

1879 was the beginning of a period of extensive foreign borrowing 14, The foreign loans were used for financing the budget deficits and increasing the gold reserves of the Bank. As can be seen in
Figure 1, the budget deficit was sharply reduced in 1882 and Temained at low levels until 1884. In addition, the curve of the Metallic reserves (see Figure 2) exhibits two peaks in the years of the heavy foreign gold loans (1879, 1884). Consequently, the devaluation Pressures of the drachma/French franc exchange rate were restrained (see Figure 4) and the monetary authorities were able to restore

Even though the monetary authorities waived discretionary power over money-supply policies— as is required by a fixed-rate regime, like the international gold standard— at the same time, they desired to maintain some degree of fiscal sovereignty. As Tables 1 and 2 show, while note circulation decreased by 23.7%, government spending was more than double the total tax revenues.
15 In 1879 Greece borrowed from abroad 60 mil. gold FF. It was agreed that the loan be used to restore gold convertibility but in actual fact the government used it to finance its deficits. In 1881 the country borrowed 120 mil. gold FF; it was also used for financing the budget deficit. In 1883 a loan of 10 mil. gold FF was contracted; it was
used for paying interest on the foreign debt. In 1884 Greece borrowed 170 mil. gold The loan was used to increase the gold reserves of the Bank and restore convertibility: (For details see Valaoritis (1902), pp. 69-92).

An interesting fact is that during the period from 1885 the servicing cost of the national debt started to increase rapidly. In 1885 interest payments absorbed more than half of total revenues and produced an increased burden on the budget. The high interest payments as well as the trade crisis that occurred in the second semester of 1884 —due to a bad domestic crop !“— caused large gold outflows. In addition, the long-lived fiat standard that the country experienced before its entrance to the gold standard, causeda lack of confidence in domestic banknotes and set in motion a run on the gold reserves of the Bank 17. From December to August 1885 the rate of teduction of gold reserves was almost 48%. 18 However, the exchange tate was not maintained fixed at the 1:1 parity. The drachma tended to devalue against the FF: Jan. 1.01, Feb. 1.01, Mar. 1.005, Apr. 1.01, May 1.02, Jun. 1.0225, July 1.0105, Aug. 1.0105. The situation got Out of hand in September. For one more time, the government faced increased military expenditure. As a result, a new phase of money Creation occurred and thus, Greece switched back to an inconvertible Paper currency standard }.
6 In November 1882, a change in the Greek monetary system occurred in order to adopt the standard of the LMU. According to the LMU agreement, the members’ Currencies were equal to one another, i.e. one gold drachma should be equal to one gold French franc. The gold French franc (20 FF) was fixed as equal to 0.2903 (x20=5.806) cams of pure gold while one Greek gold drachma was equal to only 0.2599 X20=5,.199) grams of pure gold. Thus, the par exchange rate was 1FF=1.1168 drs.
© achieve the 1 FF=1 Dr parity, the new drachma was introduced as the new Monetary unit. It was fixed as 0.29 grams of pure gold and was equal to 0.8954185 of the old drachma. a Greek trade exports were completely made up of agricultural products. se © defend its gold reserves against the speculative runs on them, the Bank used

However, it did not carry out ate 'Scount rate policy since the underdeveloped domestic financial market could not 19 tact foreign capital. en ile in December 1884 the reserve-banknote ratio was 0.68, in August 1885 it was .

1886-1909
The period from 1886 to 1909 can be separated into two different subpetiods: an inflationary period from 1886 to 1897 and a deflationary one fram 1898 to 1909. The first period was characterized by high government spending, high rates of money creation, large reserve losses and a strong devaluation of the Dr/FF exchange rate. The massive scale of foreign borrowing 2° and the persistent budget deficits led to government failure to pay off the accumulated and enlarged foreign debt by 1893. In December the government started negotiations with foreign lenders that continued until 1896, without any result. The government reduced the interest payments on its outstanding foreign debt to 30% and refused to amortize it. The negotiations stopped in 1897 when the Greek-Turkish war broke ou (April-May 1897). : It is quite striking to note that while the war was completely financed by paper money creation?! the downward movement of the Dr/FF exchange rate was not restrained, as seen in Figure 4. When debt repudiation occurred and negotiations started, private agents expected that a debt compromise would soon occur and gold would flow into the country. Thus, they acted so that the revaluation movement of the Dr/FF exchange rate was not affected by the 1897
monetary expansion.
Greece suffered a defeat and was forced to pay a huge wat indemnity in funds convertible into gold. So, she restarted negotiations with creditor countries that led to the establishment of an International Committee for Greek debt management. By law (26 February 1898) ”
20 From January to August 1885 banknote circulation decreased by —2.3% while from
September to December it increased by 7.2%. As a consequence, the drachma started to devalue heavily. In September the Dr/FF exchange rate was 1.05, in October it was 1.0 while in November it sharply increased to 1.21. ;
21 From 1886 to 1890 Greece borrowed 255 mil. gold FF. Governments relied primarily on borrowing to service the outstanding foreign debt. (see Simantiras (1905),
pp. 63-64).
2 In 1896 note circulation had decreased by 1.8%; in 1897 it had sharply increased by
17.4%.

the use of money creation as a financing instrument was strictly prohibited (article 30). By the same article, it was arranged that the government, starting from 1900, should pay to the Bank every year 2 mil. drs in banknotes until its domestic debt 23 was reduced to 40 mil. drs. (This was only achieved in 1924). A loan of 150 mil.gold FF was provided to Greece in order to pay the war indemnity to Turkey. Finally, it was agreed by the Treaty of Peace (September 1897, article 2) that tax revenues collected by the Debt Service Committee ?4 should be used for a period of 30 years for paying interests on foreign debt.

Monetary and Fiscal Policies in Greece: 1833-1914
It becomes apparent that a deflationary period had begun. It was characterized by reductions in government expenditure, low seigniorage needs, large gold inflows and a strong revaluation of the Dt/FF exchange rate2>. The average growth rate of note circulation was negative (-0.13%) and seigniorage revenues were close to zero (0.07%). Confidence in domestic currency was fostered (agents not only noticed the annual reduction in note circulation but they also knew that governments could not increase it any more) and large gold inflows occurred. As a result, a sharp revaluation of the drachma against the FF was in progress (see Figure 4)26, In 1909 the par exchange rate was achieved. Since government expenditure remained stable at low levels, the monetary authorities could switch to a fixed-rate regime. This Occurred in March 1910.
2.3 A Gold-Exchange-Based Regime, 1910-1914
The tight monetary policy pursued since 1898 threatened the economy with deflation. In order to avoid deflationary pressures while at the same time ensuring the maintenance of the fixed Dr/FF parity, the Bank was allowed by law (19 March 1910)27 to increase note Circulation only if banknotes were fully convertible into gold or foreign exchange. In other words, the Bank could create money in an amount €qual to the increase in gold or foreign exchange reserves. Moreover, the Bank was obliged by law to exchange domestic banknotes into French francs using the parity 1:1 (gold points: + 0.5
> This was established in 1895 and came under the control of the International
3ommittee in 1898.
; Is interesting to note that creditor countries forced Greek authorities to adhere to € “Monetary discipline rules”, since they benefited from the drachma’s revaluation. In ecular, according to the debt compromise (article 5), Greece starting from 1903
" i d pay every year a fixed amount of 15 mil. drs (or 9 mil. gold FF) to the creditor
Cuntries, It was agreed that when the drachma was revalued against the FF, interest tae as well as amortization should increase by 30%. (see Simantiras (1905), p.
7Not, e in Table 3 that during the deflationary period the drachma was revalued feria the FF at a rate almost equal to the rate of devaluation during the inflationary

drs.) and into gold using the parity 1:1 (+ 0.001). It was also stipulated that the Bank could hold as official reserves interest-bearing deposits denominated in foreign currencies (mainly in French francs) and readily convertible into gold, while only 10% of its reserves could be held as gold stock 28, It becomes apparent that a kind of gold-exchange standard was established’. As can be seen in Table 2, note circulation co-varied positively with gold reserves. Both moved in a way so that the reserve-banknote ratio remained stable and was close to unity (see Figure 3), Consequently, the Dt/FF exchange rate exhibited a small variability3°. Indeed, as Table 3 shows, the Dr/FF exchange rate was almost four and six times as volatile (measured by the standard deviation computed as percent per year) in the flexible-rate period as in the fixed-rate period. In the summer of 1914 WWI broke out. The pressure to finance wartime expenditures was so high that the use of money creation was inevitable. The sharp monetary expansion soon caused a confidence problem and set in motion a run on the central banks’ gold stock. Consequently, all European governments closed the «gold window» and imposed controls on gold outflows. Greece was not involved in
28 For a description of the law see Pharmakidis (1921), pp. 111-127. 29 Note in Figure 3 that while the metallic reserves-banknote ratio remained at very low
levels, the reserve-banknote ratio was close to unit.
30 There were many powerful advocates as well as opponents to the gold-exchange-based regime of the early 1910s. The advocates (Valaoritis (1911), Larkworthy (1917), Damiris (1920)) supported the well-known advantages of the gold-exchange
standard: (i) foreign exchange or gold flows through the effects on relative prices caus¢
an automatic adjustment of balance-of-payments towards equilibrium; (ii) the centr bank gained some profit by keeping interest-bearing deposits denominated in foreig" currencies instead of holding barren metal in its treasury; (iii) since currency circulation was not based on gold coins but rather on banknotes, the money supply could exhibit
a critical flexibility towards money-demand shocks. On the contrary, the opponents © the system (Thompson (1919), Zolotas (1927), Spourgitis (1929)) believed that ‘potential devaluations of foreign currencies as well as wars would endanger the foreig®
reserves of the Bank. Indeed, when WWI broke out, the devaluation of the French franc and the controls imposed on gold exports caused a loss in foreign reserves. They a! argued that the system did not introduce a rapid adjustment of the money supply since the increase in banknote circulation had to be 100% convertible into foreign exchange OF
gold. Finally, they foresaw that the system would cause inflation since gold or exchange inflows accommodated an increase in banknote circulation.

the war (until the summer of 1917) and remained on the gold-exchange based regime of the early 1910s. However, in July, following the belligerent countries, she prohibited gold outflow3s! and the central bank raised the discount rate (from 6.5% to 8%) but in November lowered it to the initial level. Using the data for the pre-WWI period we plot in Figure 5 government expenditure with seigniorage and in Figure 6 with the Dr/FF exchange rate movements. The figures suggest that there exists a positive relationship between government expenditure and seigniorage as well as between government expenditure and exchange rate movements32, Note that government expenditure and Seigniorage move together. Note, also, that high and_ persistent increases (decreases) in government spending are accompanied by strong devaluations (revaluations) of the drachma exchange rate while Moderate spending is associated by small exchange-rate movements 33,
The International Committee stipulated that the central bank could issue banknotes
(i.e. paper money) up to the limit of 66 mil. drs. The inelasticity that this imposed on note Issue caused an excess money demand and strong revaluations of the drachma against the » mainly in the months of exports of agricultural products. In order to restrain eflationary pressures, the Bank was allowed to issue banknotes over the above limit only for buying gold or foreign exchange in the parity. In November 1910 the upper limit of ote circulation (convertible to gold or foreign exchange) was fixed at 25 mil. drs. In Jecember 1911 it increased by 10 mil. drs. Furthermore, increased foreign borrowing to Inance the Balkan Wars of 1912-14, as well as increased emigrants remittances and the igh profits from shipping during the war, produced large reserve inflows and accommodated an increase in note ‘culation. In 1912 the upper limit of banknote circulation increased to 100 mil. drs, :1 1913 to 165 mil. drs and in 1914 to 200 mil. drs. Ince banknotes were 100% convertible into FF or gold, confidence in the domestic sattency was not affected and thus, the Dr/FF exchange rate remained fixed at parity. Although the controls on gold outflows suspended gold convertibility, foTelgn-exchange convertibility was still maintained. Moreover, the quantity of gold coins Circulated in the Greek money market was very limited. Therefore, the controls were
speaningless, Using the historical time-series for the pre-WWI period it is found (Lazaretou, 1991) that a strong positive long-run relationship exists between inflation tax Seigniorage) and permanent government spending as well as between permanent 8evernment spending and the Dr/FF exchange rate movements.

3. Concluding Remarks
This brief overview of the history of Greek monetary and fiscal policies reveals the existence of a link between fiscal behaviour and
fluctuations of monetary variables. Furthermore, this link was one of the main causes of the Dr/FF exchange rate crises in the nineteenth
century.
More specifically, studying the time-series behaviour of the monetary and fiscal variables we conclude that in periods of high levels of government spending and thus, high revenue needs, governments used inflation as a financing instrument. Monetary
expansion produced a confidence problem and set in motion a run on
the reserves of the Bank. The monetary authorities could not maintain the Dr/FF exchange rate fixed and thus, they switched to a flexible-rate regime. This occurred three times: in December 1868, in June 1877 and in September 1885. When government spending became moderate and confidence in the domestic currency was strengthened, monetary authorities reverted back to a fixed-rate regime. This occurred three times: in July 1870, in December 1884
and in March 1910.
