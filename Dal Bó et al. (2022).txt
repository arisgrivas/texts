Abstract
We evaluate the role of taxes on overseas trade in the development of imperial Britain’s
fiscal-military state. Influential work, e.g., Brewer’s Sinews of Power, attributed increased
fiscal capacity to the taxation of domestic, rather than traded, goods: excise revenues,
coarsely associated with domestic goods, grew faster than customs revenues. We construct
new historical revenue series disaggregating excise revenues from traded and domestic
goods. We find substantial growth in revenue from traded goods, accounting for over half of
indirect taxation around 1800. This challenges the conventional wisdom attributing the
development of the British state to domestic factors: international factors mattered, too.

1. Introduction
British expansion from the 17th to the 19th centuries established a global empire and set the
stage for the emergence of modern economic growth. In those centuries, Britain’s capacity to
wage and win wars relied on the expansion of the fiscal capacity of its state (O’Brien, 1988).
Where did Britain get the revenue required to pay for its ships and men, and to repay the
debts it incurred in fighting its wars? Historical scholarship on the development of the British
fiscal-military state — most notably Brewer’s (1989) Sinews of Power — has emphasized the
importance of increased indirect tax revenue, in particular excise revenue. The excise tax has
been treated by many historians as a tax on goods produced (and consumed) domestically.
The importance of excise tax revenue suggests a central role for revenue generated from
domestic economic activity, as opposed to revenue generated from overseas trade passing
through customs. The emphasis on domestic taxation also suggests a primary role for an
excise bureaucracy described by Brewer (1989, p. 82) as “a body of men widely regarded as
the most proficient revenue officers in government.” These officers traveled the British
counties, in contrast to customs officers concentrated in ports. This account rhymes well with
a broader literature that considers domestic institutions to be the primary drivers of Britain’s
development (e.g., North and Weingast, 1989; Acemoglu et al., 2005; Acemoglu and
Robinson, 2012). This perspective continues to influence the literature on the political
economy of historical development (e.g., Besley and Persson, 2011; Acemoglu and
Robinson, 2019; Koyama and Rubin, 2022; Angelucci et al., 2022).
In this paper, we challenge the conventional wisdom emphasizing domestic forces and
institutions. Although often overlooked, the excise was a tax on goods produced and
consumed domestically, and also on goods traded overseas (henceforth, “traded” goods).
O’Brien (1988) observed that excise revenue included taxes collected on traded goods, but
incorrectly believed that this began only around 1790.1 In fact, from its inception in the 17th
century, the excise tax was applied to both domestic and traded goods. Its collection occurred
not only in the interior of Britain, but also in its ports — especially the port of London.2
Evaluating the role of traded goods in Britain’s increased tax revenues thus requires richer
1 O’Brien (1988) writes in the note to his Table 4, “In the late 1780s, Pitt transferred a large part of the responsibility for the assessment and collection of duties on foreign spirits, tea, tobacco and wine from Customs to the Excise department.” The primary sources we reference below, along with the data collected by Hoppit (2017) make clear that these goods were taxed under both customs and excise as far back as the 17th century. 2 Hoppit (2017) presents snapshots of excise revenues collected in London suggesting that taxes on traded goods like tea, tobacco, and foreign spirits made up a significant share of excise tax revenue across the 18th century.

data than those that have been used in the literature. In particular, one needs time series that
are more disaggregated than the coarse categories (e.g., “Customs,” “Excise,” “Stamps,” ...)
reported in the primary source relied on by the reference work on Britain’s fiscal
development (i.e., Mitchell, 1988, and Brewer, 1989).3
We construct such disaggregated data from sources in the National Archives (TNA)
collection “Records of the Board of Customs, Excise and Customs and Excise, and HM
Revenue and Customs”(these are referenced under CUST 145).4 These sources allow us to
calculate yearly excise revenue raised by commodity.5 Thus, we can decompose the excise
revenue according to whether the good being taxed is produced and consumed domestically
(henceforth “domestic”), or instead produced abroad but consumed domestically, or produced
domestically but consumed abroad (i.e., goods imported or exported or “traded”). We also
construct new disaggregated customs revenue series that allow us to identify customs taxes
on traded goods as well as customs taxes on domestically-produced coal. To construct the
customs revenue series, we relied primarily on the National Archives collection “HM
Treasury – Accounts and Ledgers” as well as the collection “Board of Customs: Statistics:
Revenue”.6
That domestically-produced coal was taxed at customs is further evidence that the distinction
between customs and excise reflected the management of the tax collection process, not the
origin of the goods being taxed. This is clear when directly consulting the primary sources.
These sources, however, present several challenges that perhaps contributed to historians’
longstanding reliance on secondary, more aggregate sources. The archival sources often
present revenues at different levels of aggregation, and often have ambiguous labels. For
example, CUST 145/22 includes a category labeled “Excise,” which is evidently not all of the
traditional excise (i.e., that reported by Brewer, 1989), because it also lists categories like
“soap” and “candles” separately, which are part of the traditional excise. The “Excise”
3 Mitchell’s and Brewer’s historical source was a compilation produced for Parliament in the second half of the 19th century, “Accounts of public income and expenditure 1688-1869,” (PP 1868–9, xxxv), referenced by Brewer as “British Parliamentary Papers, vol. 35 (1868–9). This is also the source relied on by O’Brien (1988), referred to as the “Chisholm Report.” 4 This collection is part of the larger set of documents stored at the British National Archives, “Board of Customs and Excise and predecessors: Excise Duties, Receipts, Payments and Rates.” We rely primarily on CUST 145/8, CUST 145/12, CUST 145/18, CUST 145/20, and CUST 145/22.
5 In addition to producing and making available our constructed revenue series, we will make publicly available the transcribed primary source data as well as statistical software packages needed to convert these primary source data into final series.
6 We primarily rely on T 35/55, T 38/357, and CUST 37/50.

subcategory in CUST 145/22 is disaggregated in CUST 145/12. Yet, it is clear that CUST
145/12 alone is insufficient because it leaves out the categories like soap and candles that are
reported in CUST 145/22. Thus, constructing a comprehensive excise series disaggregated by
product requires careful cross-referencing of categories across primary sources.
In some cases, categories may be too broad to allow unambiguous assignment into domestic
or traded categories (e.g., salt and vinegar). We thus construct estimates of disaggregated
excise revenue reflecting conservative assumptions regarding the revenue raised from traded
goods. For example, we compute revenues collected on salt as domestic, though some salt
was certainly im- ported. Nor do we make an effort to decompose the tax revenue on
domestically-produced goods with a traded component to their value added. For example,
taxes on domestically processed textiles are treated as domestic taxation even when the main
input (e.g., a less processed textile) was produced abroad and represented a significant share
of the value added.7
Using our newly constructed data, we re-evaluate the contribution of taxes on overseas trade
to Britain’s indirect tax revenue.8 Even under our conservative assumptions, these data
overturn the conventional wisdom regarding the importance of taxes on overseas trade to
Britain’s fiscal development. The data in Mitchell (1988) and Brewer (1989) suggest that in
the early 18th century, taxes on traded goods represented a minority — around 40% — of
total indirect taxes (i.e., taxes on both traded and domestically produced goods). Over the
18th century and into the early 19th century, total revenues greatly expanded, and Mitchell
(1988) and Brewer (1989) suggest that the tax share of traded goods fell in this period to
around 30% of total indirect taxes. In contrast, our series show that the tax share of traded
goods grew from around 40% of indirect taxation early in the 18th century to more than 50%
around 1800. During the first quarter of the nineteenth century, traded goods provided a
majority of the revenue from taxed goods. This share further increases if we account for
revenues collected from traded goods and then used to subsidize exports and promote other
7 We leave for future work a more complete accounting of the role of trade in the rise of the British state and the British economy. This would require not only addressing the challenges noted above, but also more precisely estimating spillovers across sectors and the dynamic consequences of trade for the British economy. 8 Our focus on indirect taxation follows Brewer (1989), who writes, “[After 1714,] indirect taxes, most notably the excise, were overwhelmingly the most important source of the state income.” The importance of indirect taxation to British revenues in the 18th century is reflected in Online Appendix Figure B.1 (reporting data from Mitchell, 1988), showing that indirect taxation accounted for 50% or less of total British tax revenue in the late 17th century, while accounting for two-thirds or more of total revenue in the 18th century.

national objectives (i.e., revenues spent on “bounties”).9 The increase in revenues from traded
goods from 1689 to the early 19th century accounts for more than half of the overall increase
in indirect tax revenues. Tax revenues from overseas trade thus represented a substantial
component of the fiscal expansion that funded Britain’s imperial dominance.
Our analysis makes several contributions to the literature on British and global economic his
tory. Most directly, we contribute new data on British revenues over time that improve upon
the standard references (Mitchell, 1988; Brewer, 1989). We join Hoppit (2017) in arguing
against the traditional treatment of the excise as taxation of domestic production and provide
improved, disaggregated data on both excise revenue and customs revenue from 1689 to
1823. In so doing, we contribute fundamental new evidence to the literature analyzing
Britain’s fiscal development in the 17th–19th centuries (e.g., O’Brien, 2011; Murphy, 2013;
Cox, 2016; Dickson, 2017).
Our disaggregation of the excise allows us to connect Britain’s rising fiscal capacity in the
18th and 19th centuries to specific goods traded overseas. We show that the taxation of
products with inelastic demand — so called “drug foods” (Mintz, 1985) — provided a large
share of Britain’s rising tax revenue. Trade in many of these products, for example, tea,
tobacco, coffee, spices, and sugar, was supported by the application of Britain’s coercive
power — whether directed toward the colonized or toward competing powers. Taxation of
these “imperial” goods accounted for over 50% of revenues collected from traded goods as of
1818.10 Thus, we add to a literature that emphasizes the importance of trade and colonies to
the development of the modern Atlantic economies (e.g., O’Brien, 1982; Pomeranz, 2000;
Acemoglu et al., 2005; Findlay and O’Rourke, 2007; Palma, 2016; Hersh and Voth, 2022).
More broadly, by placing international trade at the center of the fiscal changes experienced in
Britain in the 17th–19th centuries, our descriptive evidence has important implications for
our understanding of both the domestic and international dimensions of British state
development. Domestically, our findings suggest an important role for tax collection by a
traditional bureaucracy based in ports, with particular concentration in London (this
9 The revenues used for bounties did not reach the Exchequer and so were excluded from the revenue figures in Mitchell (1988) and Brewer (1989). 10 We define a conservative set of imperial goods including tea, tobacco, coffee, other habituation goods (such as pepper and other spices), and sugar. This set accounts for 50% of revenues from traded goods. This fails to account for the contribution of rum, which is included with other foreign spirits in our data. When we include revenues from foreign spirits, the share of revenues from traded goods coming from imperial goods rises to over 60%.


5
reinforces the argument made by Hoppit, 2019). This is distinct from the narrative in Brewer
(1989), which emphasizes revenue collection by excisemen across Britain’s interior at myriad
points of consumption. Internationally, we show that overseas trade contributed substantial
means to building the fiscal capacity of Britain during an era in which war among European
nations in the 16th to 19th centuries shaped the rise of modern states (Tilly et al., 1975;
Bonney, 1999; Dincecco, 2011). Wars matter because they induced investments in fiscal
capacity that could then be used to fund a growing state that supported the economy (Besley
and Persson, 2009). As war became more costly, it was the states able to raise more revenue
that prevailed (Gennaioli and Voth, 2015; Cantoni et al., 2022). Identifying the sources of
Britain’s fiscal strength is pivotal to understanding the process of the formation of the state
that was victorious in this geopolitical competition.
Because much of the trade that shored up Britain’s fiscal capacity was conducted within the
institutional context of the British Empire, our work relates to the literature that emphasizes
the role of empire and coercion in the historical development of capitalism (e.g., Williams,
2021; Find- lay and O’Rourke, 2007;Beckert, 2014; Levy, 2021; Heblich et al., 2022).11
These authors consider that a strong fiscal-military state helped Britain dominate trade.
Findlay and O’Rourke (2007) also propose that trade fed back into the fiscal-military state
through the taxable wealth it created. This, they argue, established a mutually reinforcing
relationship between economic activity and the development of the coercive power of the
state.12 In the case of Britain, the possibility of such mutually-reinforcing relationship was
negated by the conventional wisdom seeing domes- tic goods as the main contributors to
Britain’s fiscal might. Our finding that international trade provided a substantial share of
indirect taxes not only counters the conventional wisdom on fiscal matters. Our finding also
increases the plausibility of explanations in which empire was a driver of Britain’s military
and economic success.13
11 The concept of “empire” is fuzzy: it was in some cases formal and in others (e.g., trade with India in the 18th century) informal. It was generally “overseas”, but in other cases was very close to home (e.g., Scotland and Ireland, brought into union with England in 1707 and 1801, respectively). We generally use the term “empire” to refer to overseas trade beyond the British Isles, whether with formal colonies or others. However, we note that Ireland is a source of exports to Britain for much of the period under study. 12 See also Acemoglu and Robinson (2019); Sánchez de la Sierra (2020); Beraja et al., (2021); and, Dal Bó et al. (2022). 13 Of course, there were other important contributors to the emergence of the industrial revolution in Britain: from resource endowments (Allen, 2009), to culture (Mokyr, 2010), to political institutions (North and Weingast, 1989; Acemoglu and Robinson, 2012).

In Section 2, we describe the role of excise and customs taxes in funding the British state,
particularly in times of war. In Section 3, we discuss the existing historical literature on the
excise tax. In Section 4, we describe the historical data sources we rely on to construct new,
disaggregated excise and customs revenue statistics. In Section 5, we present our newly
constructed revenue time series. We conclude in Section 6.
2. Background: War and taxes in 17th–19th century Britain
Britain’s fiscal capacity, like that of many early-modern European states, was developed in a
con- text of recurrent warfare. In the 17th to 19th centuries, Britain’s wars were increasingly
conducted overseas, facilitating Britain’s mercantilist economic policy.14
Brecke (1999) provides comprehensive information on conflicts since 1400. From this data,
we constructed time-series of Britain’s military activity, as well as that of other Atlantic
trading powers: France, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. We also identify which
conflicts involve fighting away from the European continent. From the 18th century on,
Britain became the most belligerent power, and the one most frequently involved in overseas
wars. In the 1600–1850 period, Britain fought 273 wars compared to 229 for France, the
second most belligerent European power during the period. Moreover, England is the nation
that shifted most aggressively toward fighting wars overseas. During the period 1600–1700,
England fought 39 percent of its wars overseas, but this percentage increases to 65 in the
period 1700–1850.
Britain’s empire was built on winning these wars, that were so frequently overseas, with its
dominant navy. Glete (1993) provides detailed information on the capacity of Britain’s navy
and the navies of its European rivals. We transcribed and harmonized the data on navy
strengths in Glete (1993) and found that during the period 1600–1800, when Britain
developed its fiscal capacity, fought wars, and expanded its empire, its naval strength
14 Britain also expanded its “empire” close to home, in particular in Unions with Scotland (1707) and Ireland (1801). These territorial expansions of the state had important consequences for policymaking and state-building across the British Isles: e.g., fully incorporating Scotland into an economic union with England and Wales; and, extracting revenues from Ireland without integrating its fiscal system into Britain’s. However, because the Unions’ impact on British revenues were limited (Hoppit, 2021), we do not examine them in depth here.


7
overtook that of all of its European rivals. First it overtook the Dutch in the second half of the
17th century, and then the French in the early 18th century.
Such naval superiority was expensive. For example, Findlay and O’Rourke (2007), citing
Baugh (2004), note that “[A] 74-gun ship costing £50,000 to build in 1780 when the largest
factory in England cost only a tenth of that amount.” It is thus unsurprising that each major
war Britain fought was associated with an increase in its stock of government debt (see
Online Appendix Figure B.2). This debt was backed by the promise of government tax
revenue, and new taxes were regularly issued in a manner explicitly linked to the demands of
war. For example, in 1689, Parliament passed “An Act for granting to Their Majesties a
Subsidie of Tonnage and Poundage and other Sums of Money payable upon Merchandizes
Exported and Imported” (2 W&M, sess. 1, cap. 4). Parliament passed this bill “for the better
enabling your Majestyes to prosecute the present Warr against the French King and for the
reduceing of Ireland.”
3. The excise: existing scholarship and an assessment of historical fiscal
motives
The conventional wisdom on the excise tax is built on three pillars, all of which are well
summarized by Brewer (1989).15 First, its domestic scope: Brewer (1989, p. 56) writes that,
“The excise was an indirect commodity tax on domestically produced goods, levied either at
their point of production or distribution.” Second, compared to the customs tax, its great and
increasing relative importance: Brewer (1989, p. 80) presents data showing approximately
equal levels of excise and customs revenues collected around 1700, and excise revenue levels
that are more than double the customs revenues in the late 1700s. Third, its contribution to
state development: Brewer (1989, p. 56) writes that, “Excises became the largest category of
taxes, excisemen the biggest body of officials, and the Excise Office a byword for
administrative efficiency. . . . [T]he English Excise more closely approximated to Max
Weber’s idea of bureaucracy than any other government agency in eighteenth-century
15 Our focus on the excise tax during the 18th century mirrors that of Brewer (1989, p. 79), who writes, “Put in its simplest terms, the fiscal history of the period between 1688 and 1714 was dominated by direct taxation in the form of the land tax; thereafter indirect taxes, most notably the excise, were overwhelmingly the most important source of state income.” This is not to ignore the occasional importance of direct taxation in this period, especially in response to acute revenue needs (e.g., wars fought in the late 18th century).


8
Europe.”16 There is some truth in this conventional wisdom: excise revenues did grow
throughout the 18th century and the excise administration was an early example of an
efficient government bureaucracy.
However, the conventional wisdom is incorrect in viewing the excise tax or the growth in
excise revenues as entirely driven by domestic forces. This is evident, qualitatively, in the
first excise bill passed by Parliament in 1643, which imposed a tax on, “[A]ll and every the
Merchants and Importers of the said Forraign Commodities in the said Schedule
mentioned.”17 In a history of the excise, the Boards of Customs and Excise describe how “At
the Accession of James II [in 1685], the Temporary Excises were renewed for his life, and
increased by additional duties on Wine, Vinegar, Tobacco, and Sugar.” Needless to say,
Britain did not produce tobacco or sugar domestically in 1685.18
To move beyond this initial assessment, we more systematically examine the military
motives behind tax bills, as well as the importance of taxes on trade during the later Stuart
reigns (those of William & Mary and of Queen Anne), when the excise and customs regimes
of the 18th century were established.19 We read and classify every tax bill in 1689–1714
according to its mention of war and/or trade. Roughly 40 percent of bills across both rulers
were “Public,” and could involve matters of taxation.20 We find that around 80% of public
tax bills mention military, colonial, or defense (i.e., “war-related”) objectives in their text;
during the rule of William and Mary, 36% of tax bills mentioned both war and taxes on
16 Brewer is not alone in taking these positions. Mathias and O’Brien (1976, p. 630) write, “In Britain excise taxes were imposed on a large number of commodities at the place of production and the state levied import or custom duties upon foreign products at the point of entry into the country.” Beckett and Turner (1990) and Ashworth (2003) also treat excise as a tax on domestic production. The data series on customs and excise taxation in Mitchell (1988) are constructed from precisely the same coarse historical source as Brewer: the “Accounts of public income and expenditure 1688-1869.” The efficiency and importance of the excise administration are emphasized by Coffman (2013). 17 Emphasis added by the authors. The bill is TNA/CUST 145/15, “An Ordnance of the Lords and Commons, In Parliament, for the speedy Raising and Levying of Monies by Way of Charge and New Impost, upon the several Commodities in a Schedule annexed,” September 11, 1643. 18 The history of the excise quoted is CUST 155/7, “Some Account of the Excise Duties,” 1829. 19 Studying the Hanoverian monarchs of the 18th century is less revealing. Because the systems of excise and customs were already established, there were fewer tax bills. In addition, because the purpose of taxation — to pay for war — became self-evident, it also became implicit, rather than explicit, in tax bills. 20 “Private” bills, in turn, affected some particular interest more circumscribed than the general public. Examples are bills affecting communal rights of passage, or roads.


9
traded goods, and this simultaneous mention rises to 50% during Queen Anne’s reign (see
Table 1).21
One may still worry that even if many excise bills mentioned trade, traded goods could still
have been marginal to the excise. Hoppit (2017) has collected evidence suggesting not only
that excise taxes were collected on traded goods as Britain’s fiscal capacity expanded, but
also that the role of traded goods was substantial and growing. Hoppit (2017, p. 293) presents
data showing that in 1741, of the excise revenue collected in London (one-third of all British
excise), imported tea and liquors accounted for nearly 40%. In 1796, imported tea, spirits,
wine, and tobacco and snuff accounted for nearly two-thirds of London’s excise revenue.
These data points, as well as our analysis of excise legislation, suggest the need to re-examine
the historical evidence that sustains the conventional wisdom. As noted above, such a re
examination requires disaggregated data from archival sources that have not yet been
systematically used.
4. Constructing new series of excise and customs revenues
4.1 Excise revenues
To construct our disaggregated excise tax dataset, we begin with CUST 145/22. This source is
sufficient to construct, by individual good, yearly revenue series from 1788 onward, allowing
21 It is important to note that taxes on imported goods also had aims other than funding wars. For example, import duties protected domestic producers from competition (see, e.g., Davis, 1966, and O’Brien et al., 1991).

Column 1 reports the count of public bills (excluding “private” bills, with circumscribed effects). Column 2 reports the share of public bills that are tax bills, column 3 reports the share of tax bills that mention military aims, and column 4 reports the share of tax bills that mention military aims and also include traded goods. Bills from the reign of William III are included in row 1 with William & Mary. See Section 3 for a discussion of the coding.


10
us to classify revenues as originating in trade or from domestic production. Prior to 1788,
CUST 145/22 is not fully disaggregated. It presents good-level excise and inland revenues for
many goods that fall under the traditional heading of “excise.” These include glass, soap,
paper, tea, and chocolate, among others (see Figure 1 for an image of CUST 145/22).
Unfortunately, CUST 145/22 also includes a category labeled “Excise” which requires further
disaggregation. It is a subcategory of what is traditionally regarded as excise, and it
aggregates revenues from different types of alcohol.
Figure 1: Excise Revenues by Taxed Good in 1756, Sample of CUST 145/22
Note: This figure reproduces a sample of the archival records organized under CUST 145/22. These records
report excise revenues by taxed good from 1788 forward. For earlier years (e.g. 1756 in this figure) the category
of narrow excise (cf. row 1 of this figure) needs to be further disaggregated.


11
To disaggregate the “Excise” category from CUST 145/22, we turn to CUST 145/8 and CUST
145/12 for the years up to 1787 (see Figure 2 for an image of CUST 145/12).22 These sources
include revenues information on various categories of alcohol, which add up to the “Excise”
category from CUST 145/22. However, they do not include the other disaggregated revenues
that are reported in CUST 145/22 (glass, soap, paper, tea, etc.), meaning that we need to
combine information from CUST 145/22, CUST 145/8, and CUST 145/12.
Figure 2: Excise Revenues by Government Act in 1750-55, Sample of CUST 145/12
Note: This figure reproduces a sample of the archival records organized under CUST 145/12. These records
report excise revenues by government act.
22 CUST 145/8 and CUST 145/12 include the same information; we rely on both sources to overcome the challenge of illegible documents.
A.3: Excise Revenues by Government Act in 1750-55, Sample of CUST


12
The next step is to convert the revenues information on various types of alcohol from CUST
145/8 and CUST 145/12 into revenue data by good at a disaggregated enough level to allow
assignment to traded or domestic categories. In some cases, e.g., “British Spirits”, this can be
done directly from the source. However, most of the revenue reported in CUST 145/8 and
CUST 145/12 is organized not according to good, but according to the acts under which taxes
were collected (e.g., “IX Continued quarto Annae”) or allocated (e.g., “ Hereditary and
Temporary Excise”).
To convert act-level revenues into revenues by good, we first identify which goods are taxed
under a given act. Then, we rely on data on taxed quantities by good and year, as well as tax
rates by good and year to calculate the revenues by good and year that fall under a particular
act.23 When rates are ambiguous (for example, imported brandy might be taxed under the
French brandy rate or as generic foreign brandy) we assign the lower rate to calculate the
revenue from traded goods conservatively.
A final obstacle in identifying revenue from traded versus domestic goods is the temporary
revenue category, “P Cent” (a percentage tax temporarily levied on selected commodities).
This category of excise appeared in the CUST 145/22 series between 1779 and 1787 and
included both traded and domestic goods. To disaggregate the category, we use CUST
145/20, which shows the yearly contributions of each of the goods charged “P Cent” duties
(e.g., tea and foreign spirits, among others).
4.2 Customs revenues
The vast majority of customs revenues were collected from traded goods, as one would
expect. The primary domestic good that was taxed under customs was coal. In addition, other
domestically produced goods were taxed under customs as “carried coastways goods.”24 We
23 This is not always trivial: for example, rum is in some years implicitly taxed at the same rate as imported brandy, and sometimes taxed as a distinct commodity. For quantities of taxed goods we relied on CUST 145/20. For rates, we relied on CUST 145/3, CUST 145/4, CUST 145/11, CUST 145/12, CUST 145/18, and CUST
145/20, as well as printed primary sources and Parliamentary bills (e.g., Crouch, 1731, Baldwin, 1770, and 6 Geo. II, cap. 17). It is important to note that this “bottom up” approach may miss some revenues (e.g., temporary excises). Such measurement error is likely small, however: in Figure 3 below, we show that our aggregate Excise and Custom revenues are extremely close to those in (Mitchell, 1988) and Brewer (1989). 24 Such goods included, for example, corn and wine; however, they appear only rarely and their revenue contribution was small, typically not larger than £2,000 per year.

assign these revenues to domestic production, along with taxes levied on coal.25 In addition,
from 1786–1806, a tax on windows (under the Commutation Act of 1784) was included in
the customs revenues, and we assign these revenues to domestic production as well.26
Disaggregated customs revenues data come from multiple historical sources. To disaggregate
total customs revenues into revenues from traded goods and revenues from domestically
produced goods, we mainly rely on T 35/55, CUST 37/1, T 38/357, and CUST 37/50. These
series end in 1806. From 1807 onwards, we supplement these sources with detailed tables on
revenues by good or by act from the Parliamentary Papers.
4.3 Methodological choices
We first identified goods that were undoubtedly traded internationally and taxed under the
excise. Some of these goods, like foreign spirits, are labeled as such. Others are not labeled as
foreign, but were certainly produced outside Britain, like tea, coffee and cocoa nuts, tobacco,
and pepper. We also treat wine as traded — in contrast with “low wine”, which was recorded
separately, and which may have included some domestic production.
This makes for an extremely conservative calculation of revenues from traded goods — a
lower bound. When it is possible that a positive share of a good may have been domestic, we
assign it to the domestic category. For example, we do not include in our estimated revenues
from trade those revenues collected on hides or salt, though some hides and salt were
certainly imported. In addition, taxes on domestically processed textiles are treated as
domestic taxation even when the raw input (e.g., a less processed textile, or raw materials like
silk or cotton) was produced abroad and represents a significant share of the value added.
We follow the approach of Mitchell (1988) and Brewer (1989) in that we report revenues net
of: (i) the costs of running the respective tax administrations (i.e., “management costs”); (ii)
refunds on import duties paid to re-exporters (called “drawbacks”); and (iii) revenues used
directly to subsidize domestic producers’ exports or to pay for other national objectives
(called “bounties”) that never reached the Exchequer. To be precise, we collect information
25 While the vast majority of customs revenues collected from coal are on domestic consumption, a small share of customs revenues are collected from the international export of coal. We count the latter revenues as revenues on traded goods. Customs were also collected from domestically produced and exported tin and lead. 26 The tax on windows is included under customs because it was enacted alongside a reduction in the tax rate on tea under the Commutation Act, and was managed by customs.


14
on the “Payments into Exchequer” for both customs and excise.27 As our goal is to assess the
contribution of taxes on traded goods to Britain’s fiscal strength, it is natural to consider
revenues net of tax administration costs and net of refunds paid to re-exporters (re-exported
imports may not have arrived in the first place without the refund of the import duties).28
However, netting out bounty payments, while standard practice, is more questionable: bounty
payments may not have reached the Exchequer, but they supported the state’s strategic
objectives, nonetheless. For example, bounty revenues were collected by customs officers
from traded goods and used to pay domestic corn producers and to support the civil
government of Scotland (to give two prominent examples). There is thus a good argument to
include these revenues in the contribution of traded goods to revenue. Information on these
bounty payments was not available in the primary sources consulted by Mitchell (1988) and
Brewer (1989), but we are able to identify this category of revenue. We thus construct
separate series of revenues from traded and domestic goods that include the bounty revenues
in addition to the “Payments into Exchequer.” In order to keep our exposition as close as
possible to that in the received literature, in the main text we focus on revenue series
corresponding to “Payments into Exchequer,” and include bounties in alternative series
reported in the Appendix.29
5. Empirical patterns
5.1 New vs. old series: comparison in the aggregate
We begin by comparing our total excise revenue and customs revenue series for the years
1689–1823 with those in Mitchell (1988), the standard reference (which is based on the same
historical source as Brewer, 1989). In Figure 3, Panel A, one can see that our construction of
27 We also follow Mitchell (1988) and Brewer (1989) in reporting revenues collected in Britain (but not Ireland), and we report these revenues in millions of pounds in nominal terms. It is worth noting that the revenue increases over the time period we cover were not driven by higher price levels. Inflation over the period studied was low — below one percent per year (Thomas and Dimsdale, 2017). 28 One category of re-exported goods deserves specific mention: textiles that were imported from India solely for re- export. The import duty was set at 5% of the imports’ value for finished textiles imported by the East India Company (see Baldwin, 1770). There was then a refund of this duty (i.e., a “drawback”) upon re-export, which varied depending on the good and the exports’ destination, from 5% of the duty paid to 100%. The net revenues from these re-exports are included as revenue from (traded) customs in our series. 29 All data series are provided in tables included in Appendix A. Figures plotting data series including bounties are shown in Online Appendix B. It is worth noting that our data series on bounties is incomplete (starting only in 1711), due to archival data limitations (see also Hoppit, 2017).


15
total excise revenue closely matches the aggregate excise data reported previously by
Mitchell (1988)).30 Including the bounties in our excise data series has minimal effect (see
Online Appendix Figure B.3). In Figure 3, Panel B, one can see that our construction of total
customs revenue again closely matches aggregate data that have previously been collected
(Mitchell, 1988). Adding the bounties to our customs data series has a more noticeable effect,
but again the broad patterns of total revenue match those in Mitchell (1988). It is worth
emphasizing that our data come from a different set of far more disaggregated historical
sources; it is reassuring that these data yield aggregate patterns that match the established
historical data sources.31
30 Our yearly total excise, total customs, bounty, and disaggregated customs and excise data are provided in Appendix Tables A.1-A.4. 31 Note that the disaggregated data sources for customs are missing for a small number of years, accounting for the observed gaps in our series in the 1810s.

Note: This figure compares the aggregate patterns of excise and customs revenues of the British government (in
£1,000,000) as calculated by the authors (black, solid lines) with those reported in Mitchell (1988) (as grey,
dashed lines). Panel A reports the excise revenues for 1689-1823, and Panel B reports the customs revenues for
1689-1818. Gaps in the lines indicate years with missing data. See Section 4 for a description of the data and
methodology. See Online Appendix Figure B.3 for a version of this figure which includes revenues spent to
finance bounties.


17
5.2 New vs. old series: comparison of disaggregated data
We next decompose aggregate revenues into revenues collected from traded goods and
revenues collected from domestic goods. Let RevenueTradet denote the tax revenue raised on
internationally traded goods, RevenueDomestict denote the tax revenue raised on domestic
goods, Customst the tax revenue collected by customs, and Exciset the tax revenue collected
as excise, all during year t. The approach in Brewer (1989) (using the same data as Mitchell,
1988), is to assume the following two equalities hold:
RevenueTradet = Customst
RevenueDomestict = Exciset.
Then, following Brewer (1989), the trade-related share of total indirect tax revenue (i.e., the
sum of taxes from traded and domestic goods) would be calculated as:
ShareTradet = Customst / (Customst + Exciset ).
But as we have argued, it is incorrect to equate taxes on traded goods to taxes generated by
customs, and taxes on domestic goods to the excise. It is necessary to define CustomsCoalt to
denote tax revenue collected by customs on coal (a domestic product), ExciseDomestict to
denote excise taxes raised on domestic goods, and ExciseTradet to denote excise taxes on
traded goods. Then, using our disaggregated excise and customs data we can calculate:
RevenueTradet = Customst − CustomsCoalt + ExciseTradet
RevenueDomestict = ExciseDomestict + CustomsCoalt.
As a result, the trade-related share of total revenue is:
ShareTradet = RevenueTradet / (RevenueTradet + RevenueDomestict).
Importantly, we can construct these time series restricting revenues to those paid to the
Exchequer (as in Mitchell, 1988, and Brewer, 1989) or including also the revenues used to
pay bounties.


18
In Figure 4, Panel A, we first show the levels of revenues from customs and excise as
presented in Mitchell (1988) and Brewer (1989). Revenues are stacked on top of each other to
sum to total revenue from indirect taxes. One can see two patterns. First, that excise revenue
is substan- tially larger than customs revenue throughout the time period. Second, in the
Mitchell (1988) and Brewer (1989) treatment, taxes on “domestic production” — to be
precise, excise revenues — ac- count for the bulk of enormous increase in revenues in the late
18th and early 19th centuries.
In Figure 4, Panel B, we show the levels of revenues from traded and domestic goods as we
calculate them.32 A very different pattern of revenue growth appears. Revenue from traded
goods increases, rather than declines in importance as the British state developed over the
18th century. At the height of the Napoleonic wars in the early 19th century, traded goods
provide more revenue than domestic goods. If we take the entire period under study,
increasing revenues from traded goods in 1689-1818 account for 54% of the overall increase
of excise and customs revenues. The growth of the British fiscal military state was not
financed on the taxation of domestic goods alone. Rather, tax revenues from international
trade represented a substantial component of the fiscal expansion that funded Britain’s
imperial dominance.

Years with missing customs data are linearly interpolated. See Sections 4 and 5.2 for a description of the data
and methodology. See Online Appendix Figure B.4 for a version of Panel B which includes revenues spent to

20
In Figure 5, we plot the share of British customs and excise revenue from traded goods cal
culated using the approach and data in Mitchell (1988) and Brewer (1989) (i.e., treating
customs revenue as coming from traded goods and excise as coming from domestic
production), as well as the share of revenue from traded goods calculated using our
disaggregated data.
Figure 5: Revenues from Traded Goods as Share of Excise and Customs
Note: This figure compares the share of British customs and excise revenue from traded goods as computed by
the authors with the share as reported in Brewer (1989) and using the data in Mitchell (1988). The grey, dashed
line plots the share following Brewer (1989) in treating customs revenue as coming from traded goods and
excise as coming from domestic production. The black, solid line plots the share of revenue from traded goods
following the authors’ calculations and using disaggregated customs and excise data. Gaps in the lines indicate
years with missing data. See Sections 4 and 5.2 for a description of the data and methodology. See Online
Appendix Figure B.5 for a version of this figure which includes revenues spent to finance bounties.


21
One can see in the figure that the traditional narrative of a modest and declining role for taxes
on traded goods as Britain expanded its fiscal capacity is overturned when examining
disaggregated data on the excise. Indeed, our data show that as revenues expanded
enormously over the second half of the 18th century, the share of revenues from traded goods
actually increased and was over 50% of total excise and customs revenues in the late 18th and
early 19th centuries. The share of revenues from traded goods reaches a peak of over 60% in
1800, when additionally considering revenues spent on bounties (see Online Appendix Figure
B.5).33
5.3 What traded goods contributed to fiscal revenues?
An obvious threat to the success of the excise tax would have been charging rates that
discouraged imports. A standard result in public finance due to Ramsey (1927) is that optimal
taxes should bear an inverse relationship to the elasticity of demand. To gain insight into
what made a high fiscal revenue possible we examine the nature of the traded goods that were
taxed.
In Figure 6, Panel A, we further decompose, by good, excise revenues from trade.34 Tea and
foreign spirits were the most important components throughout the 18th and early 19th
centuries, with wine and tobacco playing an increasingly important role in the early 19th
century. The other goods are cocoa, chocolate, coffee and pepper. The entirety of traded
excise goods are consumption items that create habituation and have been noted to have
relatively inelastic demands — actual drugs like alcohol and tobacco, as well as what Mintz
(1985) called “drug foods.”35 Figure 6, Panel B, decomposes the customs revenues from
traded goods.36 The set of goods includes imports that were taxed under both excise and
customs (foreign spirits, tea, tobacco, etc.). The most important contributor to customs
revenue was sugar, which was not taxed under excise, and which accounted for a third of
33 Naturally, the share of total revenue (that is, the sum of indirect and direct taxation) attributable to taxes on overseas trade is smaller than the share of indirect tax revenue alone. In Online Appendix Figure B.6, we plot the share of total taxes from overseas trade using our approach as well as that in Mitchell (1988) and Brewer (1989). The divergence between our series and theirs remains the same, with both series shifted down in proportion to the share of total income from direct taxation. 34 We provide the data underlying Figure 6 (both Panels A and B in Appendix Tables A.5–A.8. 35 Pomeranz (2000) leverages Mintz’s characterization to argue that the trade on these goods gave the British econ- omy an additional boost by expanding labor supply: to afford these goods, individuals altered their laborleisure choices toward longer working hours (see also De Vries, 1994). 36 Before 1787 our customs data is disaggregated by tax act, which does not allow for a simple decomposition by goods.


22
customs revenues. A majority of customs revenues also came from habituation goods with
highly inelastic demand.
These findings help us understand why the combination of taxation and trade activity
provided a high volume of fiscal revenue.37 They also highlight the importance of Britain’s
coercive power in its fiscal expansion. One can see that a substantial share of revenues from
traded goods was due to goods whose trade (and in some cases production) depended on the
application of coercive power against colonized peoples, slaves, and against competing
European powers.
37 It is notable that this high volume of revenue was collected despite the fact that the excise tax was not expanded to cover a wide variety of goods (as proposed by Walpole in 1733) and despite the elimination of taxes on exports.


23
Figure 6: Decomposition of Revenues from Traded Goods
Panel A: Excise Revenues, 1720-1823
Panel B: Customs Revenues, 1787-1809
Note: This figure decomposes British government revenues from traded goods (in £1,000,000). Panel A plots
excise revenues by traded good for 1720-1823. Panel B plots customs revenues by traded good for 1787-1818.
Excise revenues from tea and wine include revenues from tea and wine licenses. Excise revenues from imported
beer have been included with the revenues from foreign spirits, since revenues from imported beer are too small
to be visible independently. Customs revenues from other habituation goods come from opium, licorice, pepper,
spices etc. The “Other Imports” category of Panel B includes all the customs revenues from imports other than
the habituation goods enumerated in this figure. See Section 4 for a description of the data and methodology.


24
6. Conclusion
We provide new data on British excise and customs revenues over time that improve upon
standard references. The data make clear that: (i) excise taxation was not only a tax on
domestically produced goods, but was also a tax on traded goods; (ii) taxes on traded goods
were a large share of indirect taxation, ranging from 40 to 55%; and (iii) taxes on traded
goods were a growing share of total revenues from the early 18th century to the early 19th
century, as Britain’s fiscal-military state developed. These results are evident even under the
conservative assumptions guiding the construction of our data.
The patterns revealed by the data we collect should change the narrative regarding the growth
of Britain’s fiscal state. First, it had roots in the massive expansion in British trade 
especially across the Atlantic and in Asia — that occurred in the 17th–19th centuries (as
documented by, e.g., Schumpeter, 1960 and Davis, 1962). Similar to the change in Britain’s
institutional trajectory identified by Robinson et al. (2005), overseas trade was a shock that
changed the state’s fiscal trajectory as well. Second, it relied to a significant extent on a
traditional bureaucracy located in ports—even in the case of the excise.38 This shifts both the
geographic and administrative dimensions of Britain’s fiscal development. Finally, it
depended on war and empire, which facilitated overseas trade in the goods essential to the
rise in revenues. The more general implication is that the coercive power of the state was
both an input to, and an outcome of, taxable economic activity.
38 The case of tea is instructive: as Hoppit (2017, p. 294) writes, “Tea duties could have been charged to the customs, but they came under the excise. ... 99 percent of British tea excise was collected in London, but in the late eighteenth century the capital had only 7 per cent of Britain’s’ 53,000 licensed tea dealers.”

Excise Revenues Customs Revenues
Paid to Exchequer: Paid to Exchequer:
Note : These tables report the yearly excise and customs revenues of the British government (in £1,000).
Columns 1-3 report the revenues paid to the Exchequer collected by the excise, and columns 5-7 report the
revenues paid to the Exchequer collected by the customs. These exchequer revenues are net of management
costs, drawbacks, and bounties or other charges paid out of the revenues. Columns 2-3 for excise and
columns 6-7 for customs disaggregate the exchequer revenues into those collected from traded and
domestic goods. Columns 4 and 8 report the revenues that finance bounties or equivalent charges for
national objectives. These revenues never reached the Exchequer and are therefore not included in the totals
of columns 1 or 5. The excise revenues paying for bounties (in col. 4) are solely derived from traded goods. All
the customs revenues paying for bounties (in col. 8) are collected from traded goods. Cells are left empty
whenever data is missing. See Section 4 for a discusion of the sources and methodological choices.

Table A.8: British Customs Revenues from Overseas Trade (in £1,000), 1787-1818
Note: These tables decompose British government revenues from traded goods (in £1,000), corresponding to Figure 6 in the text. Tables A.5-A.7 provide excise revenues by traded good for 1720-1823. Table A.8 provides customs revenues by traded good for 1787-1818. Excise revenues from tea and wine include revenues from tea andwine licenses. Excise revenues from imported beer have been included with the revenues from foreign spirits. Customs revenues from other habituation goods come from opium, licorice, pepper, spices etc. The category of Table A.8 includes all the customs revenues from imports other than the goods enumerated here. See Section 4 for a description of the data and methodology.

Note: This figure plots the share of British total revenue from indirect taxation (i.e., excise and customs revenue)
over time. Source: Mitchell (1988).

Figure B.3: Comparison of Aggregate Revenues with Mitchell (1988), with Bounties
Panel A: Excise Revenues
Panel B: Customs Revenues
Note: This figure compares the aggregate patterns of excise and customs revenues of the British government (in
£1,000,000) as calculated by the authors with those reported in Mitchell (1988). Panel A reports the excise
revenues for 1689-1823, and Panel B reports the customs revenues for 1689-1818. The black, solid line plots
revenues as paid into the Exchequer plus revenues spent on bounties and other national objectives. This figure
reproduces the plots of Figure 1, but with Exchequer plus bounty revenues instead of solely Exchequer
revenues. Gaps in the lines indicate years with missing data. We assume zero excise revenues spent on bounties
before 1761. See Section 4 for a description of the data and methodology.

Figure B.4: Revenues from Traded Goods and Domestic Goods, with Bounties
Note: This figure decomposes the excise and customs revenue of the British government (in £1,000,000). The
black area plots the levels of revenues from traded goods, and the grey area plots the revenues from domestic
goods. These revenues are the sum of Exchequer revenues and revenues raised to pay for bounties and other
national objectives, as calculated by the authors. This figure reproduces the plots of Figure 2, Panel B, but with
Exchequer plus bounty revenues instead of solely Exchequer revenues. Years with missing data are linearly
interpolated. We assume zero excise revenues spent on bounties before 1761. The figure starts in 1711, as we do
not observe data on bounties before that year. See Section 4 for a description of the data and methodology.

Figure B.5: Revenues from Traded Goods as Share of Excise and Customs,
with Bounties
Note: This figure compares the share of British customs and excise revenue from traded goods as computed by
the authors with the share as reported in Brewer (1989) and using the data in Mitchell (1988). The grey, dashed
line plots the share following Brewer (1989) in treating customs revenue as coming from traded goods and
excise as coming from domestic production. The black, solid line plots the share of revenue from traded goods
following the authors’ calculations and using disaggregated customs and excise data. Our Data with Bounties is
the sum of Exchequer revenues and revenues spent on bounties and other national objectives. This figure
reproduces the plots of Figure 3, but with Exchequer plus bounty revenues instead of solely Exchequer
revenues. Gaps in the lines indicate years with missing data. We assume zero excise revenues spent on bounties
before 1761. The black line starts in 1711, as we do not observe data on bounties before that year. See Section 4
for a description of the data and methodology.

Figure B.6: Revenues from Traded Goods as Share of Total Revenue
Note: This figure compares the share of British total revenue from traded goods as computed by the authors with
the share as calculated following Brewer (1989) and using the data in Mitchell (1988). The grey, dashed line
plots the share following Brewer (1989) in treating customs revenue as coming from traded goods and excise as
coming from domestic production. The black, solid line plots the share of revenue from traded goods following
the authors’ calculations and using disaggregated customs and excise data. Total revenues data come from
Mitchell (1988).
