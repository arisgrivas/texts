The recent financial crisis has placed the concept of fiscal dominance at the center of current debates on macro-prudential policies. However, empirical evidence of fiscal dominance, understood as fiscal policy driving monetary policy, has been mixed, especially for low inflation countries. The literature hypothesizes that institutional constraints are the reason for the failure to connect deficits to money and prices in these countries. This paper, focusing on Spain 1874-1998, illustrates their constraining role in two steps. First, a recursive estimation of the link from budget to money shows how the degree of fiscal dominance varied over time. Second, we are able to establish a connection between these changes in the intensity of fiscal dominance and changes in the intensity of the institutional (exchange rate and central bank independence) constraints.
I. Introduction
Following the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008, some countries' fiscal problems threatened the future of the euro, thus reopening the debate on the feasibility of a European monetary union. Yet, doubts about this possibility are not new. In the late 1980s, some scholars, such as Dornbusch (1987) and Grilli (1989), expressed concerns that countries like Spain, with a long tradition of public deficits, were joining other more disciplined countries in the European Monetary System (EMS). In their opinion, the coordination of monetary policies to keep the exchange rate within a band might not make up for the renouncement of financing deficits through the issue of high-powered money. However, at that time, although the theoretical nexus from deficits to prices through seignior age was firmly established, on the empirical side, the evidence of fiscal dominance, understood as fiscal policy driving monetary policy, was somehow mixed.1 This was the case of the studies carried out for the USA. For this country, while authors such as Barro (1977, 1978a, b), Levy (1981), Hamburger and Zwick (1981), Allen and Smith (1983), Miller (1983) and Ahking and Miller (1985) found some kind of relationship between budget and money and/or budget and prices in different periods between 1950 and 1980, others, including Niskanen (1978) and Dwyer (1982), failed to do so. The failure to find this link was also the result of
1 In this paper, the term seigniorage - the revenue that a government gets from issuing money - refers to changes in the monetary base. The reason is that Spain was a fiat money economy for most of the period under study. Even when gold and silver coins surpassed the value of notes (1870-1890), changes in the monetary base were driven by the printing of notes. Therefore, given that the difference between the face value of a note and its marginal printing cost is the face value of the note (Buiter, 2007), we take the increases in monetary base as increases of the revenue for the government.

King and Plosser (1985) and Giannaros and Kolluri (1985) when studying a sample of developed countries over the period 1950-1980, while Protopapadakis and Siegel (1987) were only able to find very weak evidence.2
The provision of compelling empirical support for the link from deficit to money or from deficit to prices had to wait until the arrival of panel analysis that included high-inflationary (normally, developing) countries. Fischer et al (2002), working with a sample of 94 countries for 19601 995, provided evidence of such a relation for (non-developed) economies with very high inflation levels. More specifically, they found that, when allowing different coefficients for high- and lowinflation countries, the coefficient that linked deficits and money rose sharply for the former while it fell for the latter and became insignificant. These authors also revealed a significant relation between budget and prices when analyzing the sub-panel of high inflation countries. This evidence was reinforced by Catão and Terrones (2005) who, covering 107 countries in the period 1960-2001, found a link between fiscal deficits and inflation when the most developed and low-inflation economies were excluded from the panel. As in previous works, they did not find any significant connection for low-inflation developing and developed countries. This failure, in their own words, kept open the question of why the theory that postulates that fiscal deficits are inflationary seems to be violated in these cases. In their concluding section, the authors provided two hypotheses. For the group of low-inflation developing countries, they suggested that the fact that most countries had pegged exchange rates was the reason to discard the assumption of fiscal dominance that underlies the theory. For the group of lowinflation developed countries, they mentioned the greater autonomy of central banks and other institutional constraints that result in public borrowing being more closely related to the tax optimal theory than to a systematic source of financing deficits. In this paper, we sacrifice geographical coverage with the aim of providing supporting evidence for these hypotheses. We focus on Spain 1875-1998, based on the intuition that this country, for different reasons, will show the necessary variability in the degree of fiscal dominance to statistically reveal its determinants. In Escario et al (201 1), we found that there was a strong causality from budget to changes in the monetary base when taking the period 18751998 as a whole. Here, we carry out a recursive estimation and provide evidence that the degree of fiscal dominance, measured as the intensity of causality from budget to money, effectively varied over time. The contribution of this paper is to establish a connection between these changes in the degree of fiscal dominance and changes in the Spanish institutional framework. More specifically, we find that changes in institutional constraints, be the changes in the exchange rate regime or in the autonomy of the Bank of Spain, matter. As regards the exchange rate regime, we investigate whether the macroeconomic trilemma played an active role by limiting the margin to finance deficits monetarily. To that end, we have built an index that combines one de facto exchange rate regime indicator with two different measures of capital mobility. To capture to what extent the status of the Bank of Spain functioned as a constraint on fiscal dominance, we have built a de facto index of its governmental independence by relating the turnover of the bank governors to political events. We find that both measures of constraint show a significant negative relationship with the annual values of the likelihood ratio (LR) causality test recursively applied to the link between budget and monetary base. In other words, we provide statistical support for the relevance of institutional variables in explaining differences in the degree of fiscal dominance.

Fighting fiscal dominance 25
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present the hypothesis of fiscal dominance and its theoretical determinants. In Section 3, we summarize the Spanish historical narrative, focusing on the events that, according to theory, might have influenced the intensity of the link between budget and money over time. We build a range of indexes reflecting these events. In Section 4, we present the methodology used to estimate variations in the intensity of the link from budget to money and relate these variations with indexes of economicstructural, financial, and institutional changes. Finally, in Section 5, as well as concluding, we relate our findings to the recent threats of fiscal dominance in the eurozone.
2. Fiscal dominance: concept and determinants
The concept of fiscal dominance, as the term itself suggests, refers to a scenario where monetary policy is driven by fiscal policy or, in other words, a scenario where the issue of money reflects the need to finance deficits. According to King and Plosser (1985), the potential influence of fiscal policy on monetary policy starts with the t single-period budget constraint
Dt ~ Dt- i = NFSř -h Rt-ļDļ-ļ - Tt - Zt , (1)
where Dt is the stock of public debt in year f; NFSř, the non-financial public spending; R the nominal interest rate; Tt the taxes collected in year t and Zt the funds transferred by the central bank to the Treasury, in other words, the seigniorage . By dividing all the variables in equation (1) by the product of real income^ and the price level Pn and solving forward, we obtain 00 00
dt + Tj-nfSf+y = ^2 Jņ(T[+j + zt+J), (2)
7- 1 j= I
where the lower-case letters indicate that the variables are divided by the nominal income and
jjj denotes a net discount factor.3 Equation (2) expresses the inter-temporal sustainability of budget constraint. To introduce the role of monetary policy in this constraint, King and Plosser (1985) consider the t single-period behavior of the central bank
Ft - Fm = rt-1Ft-1 + (MBř - MBř_x) - Zř, (3)
where Ft is the stock of assets held by the central bank in year t and MB is the monetary base. By transforming Ft and Zt in the same way as those of the single-period budget constraint and substituting z in equation (2), the consolidated inter-temporal budget constraint is obtained
r ^ / AMBř+A
0 dt -ft) + ^2 y^nis'+j r = J2yA ^ V t<+> + AMBř+A P Y t+jj ) ' (4)
jťi V P t+j Y t+jj
where AMBr+7 = MBř+y - MBř+J_ 7. Given this constraint, fiscal policy is said to be dominant when the fiscal authorities autonomously fix the path of spending and conventional taxation. As Sargent and Wallace (1981)

argue, to satisfy the inter-temporal budget constraint, the printing of money can initially be kept under control if the government issues debt to finance deficits. But, if deficits persist and a per capita real debt maximum is assumed, it is enough for the rate of return on debt to exceed the economy's growth rate for the budget constraint to eventually force the printing of money. Thus, under a regime of fiscal dominance, the theoretical nexus is between deficits and the present discounted value of the revenue from seigniorage . In other words, the hypothesis of fiscal dominance requires the existence of a dynamic causal link from deficits (contemporaneous or previous) to money creation. The next step is to clarify under which conditions the fiscal authorities will be more prone to establish a path of spending and conventional taxation that, eventually, forces the monetary authority to print money. A useful starting point might be the optimal taxation theory, according to which, to finance a given level of public spending, governments choose the combination of revenue sources (conventional taxes and seigniorage ) that equals the marginal deadweight losses from each source (Phelps 1973). Moreover, if these marginal deadweight losses increase with revenue, the optimization requires revenues from conventional taxes and seigniorage to be smoothed over time (Barro 1979) or, in other words, to be set to finance permanent government spending, while transitory spending is financed through debt (Mankiw 1987). Thus, one expects that as a country's development achieves significant efficiency gains in the collection of conventional taxes, the preference for seigniorage will disappear. In contrast, the lower the degree of development and the higher the deadweight losses associated with conventional taxes, the stronger the preference for seigniorage , that is, the more prone the social optimizer authorities are to fiscal dominance.
However, there is the possibility that, contrary to the assumption in the optimal taxation theory, transitory deviations from long-run spending cannot be financed through debt. A strand of the literature, starting with Click (1998), has relaxed the assumption of no bounds to public indebtment to consider a more realistic situation in which, once a certain ceiling is reached, a constraint on further indebtment forces seigniorage to take on the full financing of transitory spending. In other words, the lower the ceiling for public indebtment, the sooner the mechanism of printing money, as argued in Sargent and Wallace (1981), will start to work. In contrast, the higher the country's indebtment ceiling, the later the deficit will lead to money printing and fiscal dominance. Finally, one should consider the possibility that the policymakers, facing institutional constraints (exchange rate regimes and/or the independence of the central bank), do not follow a path of fiscal dominance. For example, there is the question of whether the macroeconomic trilemma works as a binding constraint on fiscal dominance. As Obstfeld and Taylor (2003) put it, the trilemma refers to the impossibility of simultaneously combining a fixed exchange rate, capital mobility, and an activist monetary policy. The reason is quite straightforward: when a country has credibly pegged its currency value to the currency of some reference country, any attempt to separate the domestic interest rate from the foreign is impeded by the capital movements induced by the interest rate parity rule.4 Therefore, if there is capital mobility, when a country fixes its exchange rate, the domestic money supply is endogenously determined, with little latitude for policymakers to implement a domestic monetary policy. In this case, the government is accepting a suboptimal use of seigniorage as the counterpart to
4 Some papers have estimated the intensity of the constraints imposed by the trilemma through the analysis of the adjustment of a wide group of countries' interest rates to those of their reference countries. These studies find a much quicker adjustment for periods dominated by an exchange rate commitment and simultaneous capital mobility than for periods of pervasive floating systems. See Shambaugh (2004) and Obstfeld et al. (2004, 2005).

exchange rate stability (Grilli 1989). Hence, the more value placed on exchange rate stability and the freer the flows of capital, the narrower the margin left for the government to resort to seigniorage. Concerning the issue of central bank independence, a strand of the literature, starting with Rogoff (1985), focused on how monetary institutions can influence a country's fiscal policy. In this line, Tabellini (1987) develops a game model with three players (private sector, fiscal authority, and central bank), in which gains in central bank independence modify the incentives of the fiscal authority. The idea is that if the autonomy of the central bank, by improving its strategic position, makes its commitment to the goal of low-inflation credibility, this may strengthen the incentives for the fiscal authority to balance its budget and, consequently, reduce the possibility of a fiscal dominance scenario. It is assumed that the degree of independence of the central bank and, thus, the credibility of its low-inflation commitment vary with a series of political and instrumental attributes (Grilli et al 1991) . Among the political attributes that signal independence are the non-appointment of the governor and members of the board by the government. Political independence is also assumed to be greater if there are statutory requirements for the central bank to pursue the goal of price stability. Among the attributes that enhance instrumental independence are a central bank's non-automatic and limited credit to the government and its freedom to fix discount rates. To sum up, in theory, the potential forces driving fiscal dominance can be related to deadweight losses of conventional taxation, to limits for public indebtment and to institutional factors (exchange rate regimes and the degree of the central bank independence). In the next section, we record the changes that those forces registered in Spain from 1874 to 1998 and show how they are synthesized in economic-structural, financial, and institutional indexes.
3. The Spanish historical record
3.1 The narrative
In 1 874, when the Bank of Spain was granted the monopoly of note issue, the corresponding Law was explicitly grounded on the necessity of financing deficits.5 In fact, in exchange for the monopoly, the Bank granted an interest-free loan to the Treasury, agreed to anticipate money on some tax revenues, and started buying bonds from the Treasury. But the bonds in question, initially very short-run securities, ended up being successively renewed. As a consequence, the Bank registered an increasing accumulation of bonds until, by a law of 1881, all of them were finally exchanged for redeemable government bonds of a 40-year maturity. But when, in the mid-i88os, the Spanish agricultural crisis began to seriously affect tax revenues, the sale of shortrun Treasury bonds to the Bank resumed, to such an extent that, in 1890, the Spanish authorities decided to double the limit of note issue. In return, the Bank granted the Treasury a new interestfree loan and agreed to continue buying short-run Treasury bonds to finance deficits, which again ended up exchanged, in 1899, for bonds of longer maturity. By then, note circulation had increased even more through sales to the Bank of Spain of the special Treasury bonds (the so-called Pagarés de Ultramar) issued to cover the exceptional spending of the Spanish colonial
5 The narrative is based on Flores de Lemus (1929), Olariaga (1933), Sardà (1948) and, more recently, Martín Aceña (1985a, b; 2003), for the period that runs from 1874 to 1935 and based on Poveda (1972), Rojo and Pérez (1977), González (1979), Aríztegui (1990), Malo de Molina (1998) and Rojo (2004) for the period that runs from the end of the Spanish civil war in 1939-1998. We have also studied the laws and decrees of banking regulation until 1962, which are available in boe.es/legislation/gazeta.php.

war in Cuba (1895-1898) and the related war against the United States (1898). Taken together, the ordinary and war bonds held by the Bank tripled between 1895 and 18983 while the monetary base averaged a yearly growth rate of nearly 20 percent. There was a brief respite from 1899 to i9i3j when deficits were kept under control thanks to a program of stabilization implemented to overcome the financial effects of the war. The sale of Treasury bonds to the Bank was prohibited and, moreover, surpluses were directed to redeeming part of the public debt held by the Bank. The final target was to deflate Spanish prices and permit the resumption of the gold standard that had been suspended in 1882. In these years, different measures to ease this resumption were taken. For example, the coinage of silver was prohibited and the import duties started to be redeemed in gold. Significandy, a project was presented in Parliament in 1903 addressed to adopting gold, once the metallic reserves made it possible, at the historical parity of 25 pesetas per pound. Successive projects (1906, 1908, and 1912) sought to increase the gold guarantee of notes in the Bank of Spain, proof that the standard was being borne in mind. But, with the outbreak of the Great War and the gold standard inoperative, Spanish deficits worsened dramatically. Even when normality was restored, the need to finance deficits drove the Treasury once again toward the central bank. This time, as the sale of bonds to the Bank was prohibited, the procedure consisted of selling bonds to private buyers, basically private banks, with the added feature that these bonds could be automatically pledged at the Bank at a lower interest rate than the yield on bonds received by the subscribers. This option was feasible because, although the Bank, as a private business, maintained control of the discount rate, it needed the approval of the Ministry of Finance to fix the rate of pledging. In practice, this rate was set so that there was an immediate profit in buying public bonds just to pledge them at a lower rate than their yield, which made the procedure a new privileged financing channel for the Treasury until the outbreak of the civil war in 1936. In sum, between 1874 and 1936, the pressure of deficit financing on the Bank was the rule rather than the exception. Until WWI, the direct placement of bonds in its balance sheet was the channel for financing. After WWI, as well as pledging, deficit financing was channeled through the overdraft account, whose ceiling was successively raised between 1914 and 1919 (from a maximum of 75 million pesetas to 350 million) . In 1 92 1 , it was agreed that the overdraft could increase from 350 million to a maximum of 10 percent of public spending, if this spending exceeded 3.500 million. When the 3.500 million limit was exceeded in 1931, the decision was made to raise the overdraft ceiling from 10 to 12 percent of public spending. Thus, the instrumental independence of the Bank of Spain was seriously constrained in 1874-1935. In parallel, the government gained political influence. Throughout the period 1874-1935, the Bank's governor was appointed by the government, by whom he could be removed at any time. Moreover, the presence of shareholders on the board of the Bank of Spain was progressively diluted. In 1927, three representatives of professional corporations joined the board and, later, in 193 1, three more members, these directly appointed by the government, joined it. This process of tightening links between the government and the Bank continued during Franco's autarky. During this phase, 1939-19593 Spain did not participate in the recovery of the international capital market that slowly followed the end of WWII, consequently, given the reduced domestic financial market, the deficits continued to be financed mainly through the issuing of Treasury bonds with a privileged discount clause, which again were quickly discounted in the Bank of Spain. Besides, the link between the Treasury and the Bank went on working through the overdraft account. In 1939, limits on the overdraft were removed only to be restored later, in 1946, at a maximum of 12 percent of public spending. This year, the instrumental autonomy was seriously curtailed since the government took on the prerogative of fixing the discount rate. On the political side, the presence of the shareholders on the board continued

to be diluted. With five members directly appointed by the government and ten other members representing professional corporations, the shareholders were left in a minority, occupying only twelve of the twenty-seven seats. Thus, the Bank worked as a private but highly regulated business and pledging plus overdrafts supposedly drove the path of money until 1959 when the Stabilization and Liberalization Plan (Plan de Estabilización y Liberalización, PEL) put an end to the Spanish autarky. Apart from removing the constraining system of quotas that regulated the country's foreign trade, the plan forbade the issue of public bonds with a privileged clause of pledging in the Bank and imposed monetary and fiscal controls. The exchange rate of the peseta was fixed against the dollar in i960, while the regulations on international capital mobility were relaxed. The Bank of Spain was finally nationalized in 1962, but the Treasury did not resort to it again until the 1970s, to cover the high deficits resulting from the coincidence of the Spanish democratic transition, initiated in 1975, with the two oil crises and the corresponding increase of social and economic expenses. By then, the breakdown of Bretton Woods had freed Spain from any external monetary constraint and, from 1977 to 1982, the value of public assets in the Bank's balance sheet grew from 25 to 55 percent of the total, which meant that a little over 80 percent of the deficit was immediately monetized. These assets were the result of eluding the 12 percentpublic spending ceiling for overdrafts through the transformation of excesses at the end of the year, by law, into loans. These loans disappeared in 1983 and, from that year onward, following official declarations of wanting to improve inflation control, deficits were mainly covered through the sale of Treasury bonds on the stock market, which was feasible thanks to the significant enlargement of the financial markets, both domestic and foreign, the latter reinforced by Spain's entry into the European Economic Community (1986). Moreover, the 1980s signal a loosening of the relations between the government and the Bank of Spain. On the political independence side, after 1980, governors and members of the board, once named, could not be removed until the end of their office. On the instrumental independence side, in 1988, the 12 percent of public spending that had formally been the ceiling for overdrafts was approved as the ceiling for the amount of overdrafts plus any other loan from the Bank to the government. In 1990, this ceiling was fixed at the 1989 amount, meaning that there could only be monetary financing of deficits, whether through the overdraft or through loans, during the year. Finally, the signing of the Treaty of Maastricht in 1992 meant that the country had to accomplish the nominal convergence criteria required to join the European Monetary Union (EMU) . Spain had to grant its central bank an independent legal status, while managing the domestic inflation rate to converge to those of the three lowest inflationary countries in the EU. It also had to maintain its currency within a narrow band (±2.25 percent) against the Deutsche Mark. The central bank obtained its legal independence in 1994, while overdraft and any other type of credit facilities to the government were forbidden. By 1998, the deficit was reduced to below the required 3 percent of GDP, price convergence and exchange rate stability were achieved, all of which made it possible for Spain to enter the EMU. To summarize, although the Spanish historical narrative backs up the idea of a long-run reliance on the issuing of money to finance deficits in 1874-1998, it also records a set of circumstances that, as explained in the theoretical section, might have tempered the relationship. Among these circumstances, the literature mentions several episodes in which the exchange rate policy might have worked as a constraint on the latitude of the central bank to issue money (such as the effort to fix the rate of the peseta at the beginning of the twentieth century and the acceptance of the Bretton Woods rules in 1959). The literature also records other episodes in which gains in the central bank autonomy might have worked as an incentive for the fiscal authority to reduce deficits (limits on the overdraft account in the 1980s and the

Bank of Spain's attainment of an independent legal status in 1994). Moreover, the narrative points to changes in the degree of financial development and the ease of access to international markets in the mid-1980s, as episodes with a potential weakening effect on fiscal dominance. In the next pages, with the aim of quantifying how variations in institutional and financial constraints, along with changes in variables related to the optimum taxation theory, have conditioned the Spanish resort to seigniorage , we try to translate the above narrative into indexes.
3.2 The indexes
Starting with the variables related to the basic optimum taxation theory, the literature assumes (Cukierman et al. 1992; Click 1998) that indexes of economic-structural development are useful to proxy the deadweight losses of conventional taxation versus losses from seigniorage. The idea is that more developed countries, with higher levels of technological sophistication, are likely to have more efficient and less costly conventional tax systems. Thus, in figure 1, we build a real per capita income index (Peine), using the data of Prados (2003) to proxy the efficiency of conventional taxes. A higher value of the index reflects an increase in the degree of development, a supposed fall in the relative deadweight losses of conventional taxes and, so, we expect a negative effect on the optimal resort to seigniorage. In contrast, a positive effect on seigniorage is expected when we take into account the percentages of agricultural output (AgOut), agricultural labor force (AgLab) or rural population (RuPop). The reason is that the agricultural sector is generally believed to be less efficient to tax than mining or manufacturing. The corresponding indexes, also shown in figure 1, are built with data from Prados (2003) f°r the AgOut and from Nicolau (2005) and Tafunell (2005) for the AgLab and RuPop, respectively.6 All the indexes considered suggest a secular process of economic improvement, only temporally broken in the civil war and postwar years.
6 The output data are annual and those of the agricultural labor force and rural population (population in villages under 10,000 inhabitants) are obtained assigning the decennial land register estimations to the years in between.

Fighting fiscal dominance 3 1
Measures of the domestic financial development (Click 1998; Aisen and Veiga 2007) have been used to proxy a country's margin to cover deficits without issuing money. To consider the ease with which governments can finance deficits through debt, we first calculate the ratios of effective money plus deposits (M3) and liquid assets held by the public (M3 plus other liquid assets) (LAPS) over GDP, both taken as measures of the depth of the domestic banking system.7 An increase in the ratio reflects a deepening of the Spanish banking system, a greater margin to finance deficits through debt and, consequendy, we expect a negative effect on seigniorage . According to these ratios, as shown in figure 2, the deepening of the Spanish financial system was interrupted during the 1940s and 1950s, the years of Franco's autarky. The gains in depth resumed sharply in the 1960s, were briefly interrupted during the 1970s oil crisis, and recovered again from the mid-1980s onward. Despite these changes in rhythm, in the same way as with the structural-economic indexes considered above, there is a clear long-run positive trend for the depth of the Spanish banking system. Moreover, we have direct data on the Spanish (domestic plus foreign) outstanding debt in 1875-1998. On the one hand, there is the possibility that governments rely more heavily on seigniorage once the level of outstanding debt reaches a ceiling, in which case, a positive link between the debt level and seigniorage is expected. On the other, it is also possible that an increase in the debt level is reflecting how a government is taking advantage of an increased ceiling, in which case, a negative link is expected. Using the figures compiled by Comin and Diaz (2005), we first calculate the ratio of debt over GDP and then, following Aisen and Vega (2007), we categorize the observations according to their deviations from the median value. The resulting debt level dummy (Debt), also shown in figure 2, is categorized into five classes that range from o to 100, a higher value meaning a higher level of outstanding debt. The variable shows a decreasing trend, only broken in 1985, when the level regains its pre- 1 960s range. To build an index for the exchange rate constraint on seigniorage , we start by establishing the fixity of the Spanish peseta exchange rate over time. To do so, instead of a de iure classification based on the officially declared exchange regime, we prefer to work with a defacto coding.8 We build the exchange rate regime indicator following Shambaugh (2004), who proposes a twocategory coding regime of exchange rates into pegs or non-pegs, depending on the volatility. The criterion is to consider a year as a pegged year if the difference between the maximum and minimum month-end values falls within a ±2 percent band. The monthly exchange rate of the peseta against the dollar for 1875-1937 comes from Global Financial Data, for 19381939 from Sánchez-Asiaín (2012) and for 1940-1981 from Ilzetzki et al. (2008). As in Shambaugh (2004), in 1982, the anchor currency is changed from the dollar to the Deutsche Mark, the rates of which have been provided by the Bank of Spain. If the difference between the maximum and minimum month-end values falls within a ±2 percent band, we consider that an exchange rate arrangement is at work and assign value 1 to the corresponding year. If the intra-annual volatility falls outside this four percent range, we assign value o to this year.9 However, as said before, if the fixity of the exchange rate is to constrain the autonomy of the domestic monetary policy and, consequently, to constrain the margin for issuing money, it must be combined with a certain level of capital mobility. Thus, in order to capture the effective
7 The sources are the same as those cited in Section 4 for the monetary base. 8 Our preference for the latter is a result of the evidence available, starting with Calvo and Reinhart (2002), that, sometimes, governments conduct exchange rate practices which differ from those declared. Because our interest is to proxy the real constraint that an exchange rate goal exerts on the domestic monetary policy, we need a de facto classification. 9 The results barely change if we make the criterion stricter by narrowing the band to ±1%.

constraint, we modify the exchange rate dummy multiplying it by a proxy for capital mobility, Quinn's index (QMob). Quinn's (2003) index is a de iure measure that, by considering the ease of getting approval for capital payments and the necessity of surrendering receipts or not, allows a scale from o to 100 in the intensity of capital account openness, with a higher value denoting a higher capital mobility. As shown in figure 3, restrictive regulations on the Spanish capital flows followed the end of WWI, these restrictions remaining until the PEL of 1959. This index also signals the mid-1980s as the start of a process of liberalization that ended with the full recovery of mobility in the late 1990s. Multiplying the exchange rate dummy by this index, we obtain a new variable, which measures the external constraint (QExtConst) and ranges from o to 100. It takes value o when either there is no exchange rate fixity or there is fixity but no capital mobility. This variable runs parallel to the dummy (TrExtConst) resulting from multiplying the exchange rate dummy by the Spanish trade openness rate (see Supplementary Material, Appendix Si). In figure 4, there was some constraint at the beginning and at the end of the twentieth century and during the Bretton Woods years. For these periods, assuming that an external goal of stability is the rule, a weakening of fiscal dominance is expected. Finally, we examine the constraint on freely resorting to seigniorage that might result from the independence of the central bank. As explained above, the Bank of Spain was granted the monopoly for issuing money in 1874 but, on paper, it maintained its de iure independence until its nationalization in 1962. It did not recover its independent legal status until 1994, as a requirement for Spain to join the euro. However, there is the possibility that, during the years of legal independence, the defacto and de iure status diverged. To test for this possibility, we follow Cukierman and Webb (1994) and relate the turnover of central bank governors to political events. According to these authors, in the presence of heavy political influence, the frequency of the changes of governors should be significantly higher in periods immediately after political

transitions than in nonpolitical periods. They establish that the cutoff between political and nonpolitical periods is within six months after the latest political transition, be it a change of the head of the government or a change of the party in government. Moreover, given that the electoral cycle is of at least four years, they fix the critical turnover somewhere between 0.2 and 0.25 (an average tenure of four to five years) and consider that, above this threshold, central bank independence is lower, the higher the turnover rate. We have matched changes of cabinet (changes of head of cabinet and changes of the party) with changes of governors and obtained that, for the whole period 1875-1998, the frequency of governor changes in political periods (GovPol) was o .3 2 (o . 22 if we require a change of party) . However, as illustrated in

Figure 5. Frequency of Bank of Spain Governor changes in political periods and Bank of Spain constraint .
figure 5, the distribution of this frequency was far from homogenous. The turnovers were concentrated in 1875-1939, when the Bank of Spain was a private business, and the political turnover averaged 0.54 (0.38 if we require a change of party).10 Therefore, if the years of high interventionism during Franco's dictatorship are discarded, we get a picture where the central bank constraint (BoSpCons) on seigniorage might have only worked (the political turnover of governors only fell below the 0.20 threshold) from the 1980s onward. The profile fits in perfectly with the attributes of political and instrumental autonomy that the bank gained from the government in this decade, which we referred to in the previous sub-section.
4. Methodology and results
Figure 6 shows, for Spain 1875-1998, the series of public budget (pb ) and the growth of the monetary base (« dmb ), both related to the nominal GDP. Data on budget come from Comin and Diaz (2005). The variable is the difference between public revenues and public spending, so a positive figure indicates a surplus and a negative figure indicates a deficit.11 Data on monetary base come from Tortella (1974) for the period 1874-1900. From 1900 to 1935, we use the figures from Martín Aceña (1985a, b), and from 1940 to 1962 from Martín Aceña (1988). 12
10 In fact, there was no party cabinet change without governor removal in 1875-1939, which means the maximum value of i for the index of central bank vulnerability, defined by Cukierman and Webb (1994) as the fraction of political transitions that are followed by a change of governor within six months. 11 The series of Spanish budget requires the inclusion of three dummy variables. The first one covers the Spanish war years against Cuba and USA (1896-1898) due to our ignorance of the real deficit in the period. Two more dummies (1909-1911 and 1921-1922) are included to remove atypical fluctuations in deficit caused by the conflicts with Morocco.
12 During the period 1874-1900, the lack of disaggregated information about private accounts in the Bank of Spain makes it necessary to include the item deposits of the private agents in the Bank of Spain in the definition of monetary base. For the sake of homogeneity, this definition is maintained until the outbreak of the Civil War, even though, from 1900 onward, there is information available about private deposits.

Figure 6. Public budget (ph, left axis ) and monetary base growth (dmb, right axis ) over GDP
For the next period, 1962 -1981, detailed information is available in the Historical Series of the Bank of Spain (1982). Finally, for the period 1982-1998, several Statistical Bulletins from the Bank of Spain are used. Both variables, budget and the growth of the monetary base, are expressed in terms of nominal GDP, the latter coming from Prados (2003). In Escario et al (20 11), both of these series were found to be /( o) and, consequently, a stationary vector autoregressive model (V'R) was used to study their relationship. In a general form, a ^-order VAR can be expressed as
Yt = ^2 + AXt + e„ (5)
1=1
where Yt is a vector of k endogenous variables and Xt may include the deterministic components, intercept, trend or dummy interventions. In the case of having two variables ( k = 2), the following specification has to be used
pp
pbt = Y2 ßii ,¡Pb"-¡ + ßi2, idmbt~i + arXt + Et (6)
1=1 i-l
PP
dmbt = ß2lidmb,-i + ß22ipbt^i + a2Xt + £ (7)
i- I 1=1
We can test for causality between pb and dmb in the sense of Granger (1969, 1988) according to which dmb is not causing pb if all lagged values of dmb are zero in equation (6), and pb is not causing dmb if all its lagged values are zero in equation (7) . In practice, the null of non-causality can be tested by applying a LR test, that is to say, by making ßl2 = o Vi in equation (6) and ß22 = oVí in equation (7) . Previously, it is necessary to select the order of the VAR in accordance with the Schwartz information criterion (SBIC) and the Akaike information criterion (AIC) and check for autocorrelation, heteroskedasticity and normality in the residuals.

Figure 7. Results of recursive causality test Causality from budget to monetary base growth.
this procedure to the period 1875-1998, Escario et al (2011) found that there was a strong Granger causality (at the 1 percent level of significance) from budget to changes in the monetary base. On the other hand, high-powered money growth never caused the budget.13 Taking this result as our starting point, we are here interested in the evolution of the causal relation from budget to money. So, instead of applying the LR causality test to the whole period, we carry out a recursive estimation to examine whether the intensity of the link from budget to monetary base changed over time. The method is the same as that explained above, but starting with the sample 1875-1895 and enlarged yearly until it covers period 1875-1998. Figure 7 shows how the Wald statistic varies when recursively computing causality.14 We find that the effect of budget on monetary base rises systematically before the civil war and reaches a maximum in 1943. Causality, although below the maximum of 1943, maintained a high level from 1945 until 1959. During the 1960s, the link weakened and then partially recovered from the mid-1970s until 1984, when a new weakening of causality started and intensified in the late 1990s.15 The question is to what extent changes in the Spanish economic structure, in the degree of financial development and in institutions, that is, changes captured by the indexes in Section 3, have caused variations in the reliance of a government on seigniorage , this reliance being measured through the values of the LR causality test. As a preliminary task, we carry out a covariance analysis of all the indexes. The results, in Supplementary Material, Appendix S2, support the visual intuition that a good number of them share common trends. These common traits and differences between indexes are summarized, by applying a principal components analysis,
13 This result is supported by computing the forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD), whose evolution confirms the non-influence of innovations in money on the budget, at the same time showing that nearly 15% of the forecast error variance of the monetary base is due to fiscal shocks. This fact is consistent with the hypothesis that money has behaved endogenously to fiscal policy in the long run, which is also supported by the corresponding impulse-response functions (IRF). Details can be obtained from the authors upon request. 14 To test for the robustness of this recursive method, we have also estimated the link between budget and monetary base under different fixed-extension windows. The results of working with twenty-year windows are displayed in the Supplementary Material, Appendix S3. 15 We obtain the same profile if, instead of Prados' (2003) data, we use the GDP values estimated by Maluquer (2009) . Thus, for reasons of comparability with previous analysis, we continue working with Prados' database.

into three components. As shown in table 1, there is a first component (PCi) driven by the variables related to the economic structure and banking development. The agricultural and rural indexes enter with a positive sign, while per capita output and banking depth enter with the opposite sign. So, this first component can be taken as an inverse measure of progress. There is a second component (PC2) driven by the exchange rate and capital mobility indexes. Finally, there is a third component (PC3) driven by the indexes related to the independence of the central bank and the debt level, both entering with the same positive sign. Thus, this third component can be taken as an inverse measure of the incentive/necessity for a government to resort to seigniorage , depending on the level of autonomy of the central bank and/ or the height of the ceiling on borrowing. Figure 8 illustrates the performance of each component over time, including a dotted line reporting the causality LR test variable. The results of estimating the relationship between these three principal components and the LR causality test values, displayed in table 2, show a significant negative link with each of the three composite indexes that, taken together, explain 34 percent of the test value variation between 1895 and 1998. For PCi, we find an effect that does not agree with the optimal taxation theory, which posits, as said before, a negative link between progress and the intensity of the resort to seigniorage . Because our composite index is an inverse measure of progress, we expected to find a positive effect. However, if we treat the increase in the LR test values associated with the financing of the Spanish civil war as exceptional and introduce a dummy in 1942, do we find that the sign of the link, although without reaching significance, changes to positive.16 This change to a positive sign is fully consistent with the long-run downward trend, shown in figure 8(1), which PCi and the LR causality test trajectories shared after the mid-i940s. Before then, the secular downward movement of progress captured by PCi does not share its trend with the LR test values. We think that the Spanish delay in implementing a modern tax system more directly linked to the gains in income until the second half of the twentieth century might explain the lack of significance of the economic-progress component when the period 1895-1998 is taken as a whole.17
16 The application of the Quant- Andrews test for unknown change points locates a structural change for the series of LR causality test values in 1942, precisely the year in which a wide post-belium monetary arrangement was implemented. 17 We owe this hypothesis to an anonymous referee.

Interestingly, the inclusion of a dummy variable capturing the exceptionality of the war years leaves the significant negative signs of PC2 and PC3 unchanged^ while the global explanatory power of the model improves by up to 44 percent of the LR test variation. For PC2, the statistical confirmation of a significant negative link fits in perfectly with the visual complementarities shown in figure 8(2) in terms of a tighter exchange rate constraint and lower LR test values.18
18 To discard the possibility that the control of fiscal dominance led to exchange rate stability, rather than that the exchange rate stability had a disciplinary effect on seigniorage , we have tested the exogeneity of the de facto exchange rate regime carrying out the following procedure.

Complementariness is clear at the beginning and the very end of the twentieth century and in the Bretton Woods period. Thus, the relevant contribution of PC2 to the explanatory power of the model (notice that its addition to the PCi and dummy 1942 variables raises the R2 from 24 to 40 percent) is not unexpected. Finally, the addition of PC3 raises the explanatory power a little further, from 40 to 44 percent of the LR test variation. In this case, complementarities between PC2 and the LR test values are especially noticeable when looking at the coincidence, in figure 8(3), of the sharp increase of the component in the mid-1980s with a clear weakening of the LR test values. Since this component is an inverse measure of the incentive/possibility for a government to rely on seigniorage , the negative sign is consistent with the defacto gains in independence of the Bank of Spain and the contemporaneous gains in latitude to borrow, consubstantial to the entry of the country into the European Common Market (1986), that we mentioned in the previous section.
5* Conclusion
This paper studies the factors behind the prevalence of the fiscal dominance hypothesis. We have focused on Spain in 1874-1998, which provides us with a case where changes in the intensity of fiscal dominance, measured through the recursive analysis of causality from budget to monetary base, show the variability necessary to statistically identify its determinants. After considering a range of economic-structural, financial and institutional variables, we establish a connection between the changes in the degree of fiscal dominance and two components, one driven by the exchange rates and capital mobility and the other by the independence of the Bank of Spain and debt. For both of these components, we find a significant negative link with the recursively estimated annual values of the LR causality test. In the first case, this significant link means that the tighter the trilemma constraint, the narrower the margin for the Spanish government to finance deficits monetarily. In the second case, the negative link means that the lower the independence of the central bank and/or the lower the ease of access to financial markets, the greater the resort of the Spanish government to financing deficits monetarily. In other words, the efforts to fix the rate of the peseta at the beginning of the
exchange rate regime, it would not be advisable to apply a standard VAR analysis. Instead, we have estimated a logit model using the fiscal dominance LR causality index as a regressor and the exchange rate category (value 1 if pegged; o if not) as the dependent variable. Thus, the model predicts the probability of an exchange rate arrangement being at work depending on the degree of fiscal dominance. The results show a non-significant relationship between the two variables, supporting the exogeneity of the exchange rate regime. The robustness of the standard inference of the logit model has been checked with a bootstrap exercise that confirms the lack of significance.

twentieth century, the acceptance of the Bretton Woods rules in 1959 and the narrow band required to join the euro weakened the degree of fiscal dominance. The defacto gains in independence of the Bank of Spain and the contemporaneous gains in latitude to borrow that accompanied the country's entry into the European Common Market (1986) and, later, into the European Union (1992), also weakened fiscal dominance. Following the entry of Spain into the EMU, in a framework of exchange rates fixed against its main trading partners (the Eurozone) and an independent central bank (the European Central Bank, ECB) openly committed to the non-monetary financing of fiscal imbalances, Spanish deficits decreased steadily until a surplus was achieved in 2005-2007. Fiscal concerns did not arise until the outbreak of the financial crisis in 2008 put an abrupt end to Spanish growth. The deficit over GDP spiked at a high of 9 percent in 201 1 and, by the end of that year, the spread of the Spanish ten-year government bonds over the German's surpassed 400 basic points. Some relief came with the exceptional liquidity measures that the ECB approved in December 201 1 and February 2012. Spanish banks took advantage of the three-year loans offered by the central bank, part of which, were devoted to buying sovereign bonds. Even so, the scale of the ECB operations was timid in comparison to the scale of Spanish fiscal imbalances, which might explain why, even when enlarging the coverage of our analysis until 2012 (see Supplementary Material, Appendix S3), the causality running from the Spanish budget to the country's contribution to the eurozone's monetary base shows no significant return to the path of fiscal dominance that prevailed in times of the peseta. Instead, internal devaluation and fiscal consolidation, addressed at reducing macroeconomic imbalances, seem to be winning the game.
