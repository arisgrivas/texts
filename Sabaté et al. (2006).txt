Abstract
The Spanish peseta never formally belonged to the gold club, neither the classical nor the exchange-rate gold standards. It has been traditionally argued that the reason was the predominance of deficits in the Spanish budget from 1874 to 1935. The financing needs of the Treasury led to money creation and, consequently, to sacrificing the gold commitment and a fixed exchange rate. Applying a stationary VAR (Vector AutoRegressive) model, this paper estimates the dynamic link between budget and money and tests whether Spanish fiscal policy actually influenced monetary policy. The results confirm the dominance of fiscal policy for the period and, therefore, provide empirical support to the idea that the problems of the Treasury were behind SpainÕs renouncement of gold.

1. Introduction
In 1992, the Maastricht Treaty imposed the cutting of deficits and debt on the countries committed to the building of the European Monetary Union. Implicit in the measure was the agreement that fiscal policy could interfere with the strict monetary policy needed by some economies to control inflation and fix the exchange rate against the euro. The scenario was quite reminiscent of that of a century ago when the impact of fiscal policy on monetary policy was also argued to be the main barrier to some peripheral currencies joining the gold standard or, after joining, to remain in it. This applied to the Spanish peseta in 1874–1935, a period that starts with the Bank of Spain becoming the monopolist of issue and ends with the outbreak of the Spanish Civil war. During this period, the peseta never formally belonged to the gold club, neither to the classical (until WWI) nor to the exchange-rate (after WWI) gold standards. According to Spanish literature, the failure to control deficits for most of that period led Treasury to repeatedly look for money creation financing (seigniorage), provoking episodes of price divergence and preventing the peseta from maintaining gold convertibility. Nevertheless, despite the general perception that the government budget conditioned money creation in these years, there has been no econometric estimation that confirms the existence of a dynamic link between both variables. To overcome this lacuna, we start by presenting, in Section 2, the episodes of Spanish monetary history on which that perception is based. Then, in Section 3, we introduce the theory of fiscal dominance. Under a regime of fiscal dominance the deficits (contemporaneous or previous) drive the path of money creation. No matter whether or not deficits are immediately monetized through the sales of Treasury or Government bonds to the central bank, the nexus is between deficits and the present value of the revenue from seigniorage. For this reason, the theoretical framework of fiscal dominance appears especially suitable for analysing the effects of the Spanish budget on money, since a sizeable part of the deficits was financed by the sales of Government bonds to private holders. Thus, in Section 4, by applying a stationary VAR (Vector AutoRegressive) model, we estimate the dynamic link between budget and money and test whether Spanish fiscal policy actually influenced monetary policy. The results confirm the existence of a strong Granger causality from Government budget deficits to monetary base for Spain during the period 1874–1935, in line with the findings obtained for countries such as Italy, with repeated episodes of inconvertibility. On the contrary, the Spanish fulfilment of the hypothesis of fiscal dominance contrasts with the absence of links between budget and money in core gold countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States of America. Therefore, given that the confirmation of the hypothesis provides evidence of how Spanish fiscal authorities actually took advantage of the fact that they were not constrained by convertibility clauses, in Section 5, we conclude that the behaviour of the Treasury was responsible for untying the peseta from gold.

2. Historical background
In 1874, financial needs led the Spanish government, under the Law of the 19th of March, to grant the note issue monopoly to the Bank of Spain for a period of 30 years. In exchange, the Bank granted a loan of 125 million pesetas to the Treasury (equivalent to 18% of that yearÕs total public spending). The loan was to finance in part budget deficits accumulated from 1868 to 1874, the socalled Revolutionary Sexennial (Sexenio Revolucionario), as a consequence of the suspension of the most important taxes (consumption taxes) and the simultaneous spending increases associated with the Carlist civil war (1872–1876).1 Apart from this credit, the Bank also agreed to anticipate money to Treasury on some tax revenues, an arrangement that survived when the Borbonic Monarchy, restored in December 1874, confirmed the note issue privilege to the Bank of Spain. The Bank continued to support the restored regime financially by buying bonds from the Treasury. The bonds in question (Pagare ́s and Letras) were very short-run securities with a maturity of 2–3 months and were successively renewed until the war ended.2 Then, under the Law of 3 June 1876, these renewed Pagare ́s and Letras were exchanged for longer-run Treasury bonds (Obligaciones), with a maturity of 12 years. However, having postponed the immediate redemption of bonds, the Treasury sought new funds by selling more Pagare ́s and Letras to the Bank of Spain. The system led to an increasing accumulation of bonds in the Bank until the beginning of the 1880s. Then, by the Law of 9 December 1881, all Treasury bonds (Pagare ́s, Letras and Obligaciones) were finally exchanged for redeemable Government bonds (Deuda) of a 40-year maturity. In this way, first by purchases of short-run bonds, renewed later into longer-run bonds, the Government component of the monetary base expanded continuously. As a matter of fact, from 1874 to 1881, the financing needs of the Treasury had largely contributed to change the composition of the money in circulation. Paradoxically, this change moved in the opposite direction to that proclaimed in the monetary reform of 1876, when by the Decree of the 20th of August, the Spanish Government had declared its intention of abandoning bimetallism in favour of gold to avoid the problems caused by the sustained decrease of silver prices of the late 1860s. In the bimetallic standard, this fall in prices meant silver overvaluation at the mint. Minting silver became a profitable business and silver coins quickly started to progressively oust valuable gold coins from circulation. To stem this process, the Spanish monetary authorities finally declared through the above-mentioned Decree of August 1876 their willingness to abandon bimetallism in favour of gold. Therefore, private mintage of silver coins was prohibited and the Government undertook to supply the necessary gold. The coins would be minted at the rate of

100 pesetas per 29 grams of gold, the equivalent of 25.22 pesetas per pound.3 Nevertheless, despite this measure, budgetary problems led the Spanish Government to continue the profitable minting of silver as well as monetizing deficits through bond sales to the Bank of Spain. Thus, even though minting was abundant (900 million gold pesetas compared to 150 million silver pesetas from 1876 to 1881), individuals continued hoarding gold and the relative importance of fiat money in circulation (overvalued silver and paper) increased. In 1881, bank notes accounted for more than 20% of the legal tender (Fig. 1). Most importantly, this expansion of fiat money driven by the TreasuryÕs financing needs was enough to offset the simultaneous decrease of gold and isolated Spanish prices from the international deflation of the 1870s (Fig. 2). In this framework of divergent prices, the peseta/pound exchange rate (Fig. 3) could only be kept stable because of the exceptional exports of wine to France, whose grape harvest had been seriously damaged by the filoxera. For that reason, when in 1881, in addition to the drop in foreign trade there was a sudden interruption of foreign investment flows and the peseta started depreciating, the export of gold became profitable and strongly stimulated paper conversion. As a consequence,

3 This was the price of gold established by the Decree of 19 October 1868, when the peseta was chosen as the currency to unify the Spanish monetary system. By crossing the price of gold in pesetas (100 pesetas per 29 grams of gold) with its price in pounds (4.25 pounds per ounce, 3.98 pounds per 29 grams), the par of the peseta against the pound was fixed at 25.22 pesetas/pound.

the gold reserves of the Bank of Spain were reduced from 126 million pesetas in 1881 to 61 million in 1882. When in 1883 the reserves decreased to 36 million pesetas, the Bank decided to suspend convertibility. It was not the first time it had done so.

Convertibility was always a discretional issue for the Bank of Spain which, in fact, between 1876 and 1883 repeatedly limited, when it did not suspend, such a possibility (Serrano Sanz, 2004).4 That is why the peseta cannot be considered to have formally belonged to the gold standard. Even though, to some extent, convertibility worked from 1876 to 1883, it was never obligatory for the Bank. Therefore, when the Bank of Spain suspended convertibility in 1883, there was nothing extraordinary in the decision, which could explain why it was not even recorded in the Acts of the Bank. However, this time convertibility was not restored so that, without having ever formally belonged to the gold standard, in 1883 the peseta became, de facto, a system with fiat money and a floating exchange rate. In this way, the option of continuing to finance deficits by expanding money remained open. The option would soon be taken advantage of when, in the mid-1880s, the Spanish agricultural crisis began to seriously affect tax revenues. Then, the sale of short-run Treasury bonds to the Bank resumed, to the point that in 1890 notes accounted for more than 40% of legal tender. In this framework, the Spanish authorities decided to renegotiate the conditions of note issuing. The Law of 19 July 1891 renewed the monopoly of Bank of Spain for 30 years (until, 1921), and above all, doubled the limit of note issue from 750 to 1500 million pesetas. In return, the Bank granted Treasury a new, interest-free loan of 150 million pesetas. Apart from that, the Bank would continue to provide the service of collection and public payments which had been recently established by the Law of 12 May 1888. According to this Law, the Bank agreed to buy short-run Treasury bonds (Letras) to finance deficits up to a limit of 165 million pesetas. When this amount was exceeded, these very short-run bonds had to be exchanged for other Treasury bonds (Obligaciones again) of longer maturity. The exchange took place in 1893 and all these longer-run Treasury bonds were successively renewed until the Law of 2 August 1899 ended up exchanging them for redeemable Government bonds (Deuda amortizable) of 50-year maturity. By then, note circulation had increased, furthermore, through sales to the Bank of Spain of the special Treasury bonds (the so-called Pagare ́s de Ultramar) issued to cover the exceptional spending of the Spanish colonial war in Cuba (1895–1898) and the related war against the United States (1898). Altogether, the bonds held by the Bank grew from 644 to 1811 million pesetas between 1895 and 1898, and the amount of notes from 910 to 1444 million. At the same time, the monetary base averaged a yearly growth rate of nearly 20%. The war, thus, highlighted the link between the Treasury and the Bank. By then, however, far from being considered exclusively the result of the war, it was seen as the consequence of a process with older origins. As the Minister of the Treasury in charge of the stabilization that followed the defeat of Spain, Ferna ́ndez Villaverde, pointed out, the problem came from the fact that:
4 In 1876 the Bank of Spain refused gold conversion to the Spanish government itself. Moreover, during the years 1876–1877, gold conversion was limited to 2500 pesetas per month. Even when, in 1878, the gold reserves approached the amount of issued notes, the Bank would still refuse to declare full convertibilityas the Bank of France had just done—preferring to relax the limit and establish an automatic convertibility up to 1000 pesetas per day.

in times of peace, without the difficulties that excuse the natural and necessary recourse to taxes to cover State expenses, the Bank of Spain has usually been its chief credit instrument. We have witnessed the Treasury asking the Bank for loan after loan, placing considerable quantities of public bonds in it (. . .), making it compensate the government budget deficits year after year with its banknotes (Ferna ́ ndez Villaverde, 1903, p. 18).
The special financial requirements of the overseas war simply rounded off a long period of deficit monetization and monetary expansion (1874–1898) that would heavily contrast with what would happen in the following 10 years. Effectively, from 1899 to 1909 (all the way to 1914, if we exclude the year 1910), the deficit disappeared from the Spanish budget (Fig. 4). The roots of this change are to be found in the Law of 2 August 1899, which focussed on controlling the costs of debt connected with the war. The Law forced the exchange of Treasury bonds (except those specifically associated with the war, the Pagare ́s de Ultramar) for redeemable Government bonds, which in turn, by the Law of 28 June 1901, would be exchanged for perpetual bonds. Such Laws, together with the coupon reduction of the Pagare ́s de Ultramar by half, managed to control the financial burden. Therefore, a period of surpluses started; more importantly, these surpluses permitted to redeem the Pagare ́s de Ultramar held by the Bank.
In 1899–1901, the Treasury redeemed more than 300 million pesetas of Pagare ́s. Then, the Law of 13 May 1902, as well as the prohibition of bond sales to the Bank, established a formal plan for the Treasury to redeem all the remaining Pagare ́s de

Ultramar, around 900 million pesetas, within 10 years. At the same time, also as part of the strategy to control money and prices, the Law raised the legal gold reserve for notes to slow down the private credit expansion with which the Bank tried initially to offset the reduction of bonds. Thus, with the monetary base under control, Spanish prices began to decrease in 1904. This fact, in a framework of increasing international prices, together with the return of foreign investment, explains why the exchange rate of the peseta/pound recovered noticeably from 1904 onwards. Despite the fact that fiscal control remained in place until 1909, the peseta was not made convertible into gold. This was because it was thought necessary, for reasons of credibility, to declare convertibility at the historical parity of 100 pesetas per 29 grams of gold, that is to say, at the rate of 25.22 pesetas to the pound. In 1900, the exchange rate was 32.56 pesetas to the pound, so the first requirement was a significant improvement in the value of the peseta. Even though this occurred from 1904 onwards, it was not enough to reach the symbolic 25 pesetas/pound before the outbreak of the Great War. For the peseta to attain parity, a much stronger deflation would have been needed. However, from the outset, the Spanish Government refused an accelerated deflation because of its potential effect on the real sector.5 The idea prevailed that a combination of moderate Spanish deflation, with a rise of foreign prices, would have been sufficient to regain the historical parity. Paradoxically, the peseta would reach its parity thanks to Spanish neutrality, just when the gold standard was suspended by the European contenders. During the Great war, Spanish deficits worsened. The financial problems of the Treasury were aggravated when Spanish political instability6 made it impossible to approve new Government budgets, and tax revenues did not increase sufficiently to meet the inflated spending that the wartime context provoked. In fact, the budget of 1914 remained in force until 1921, when a new one was passed. However, even when normality was restored, taxes were unable to finance the spending on infrastructures of the 1920s. The deficit did not disappear even when, in April 1931, the Borbonic Monarchy was replaced by the Second Spanish Republic, despite the new GovernmentÕs proclaimed intention of balancing the budget and stabilizing the exchange rate of the peseta. The inability of the Spanish authorities to reform the fiscal system by promoting taxes on personal income in order to face the increasing financial needs of the Treasury was present throughout the period 1914–1935 (Fuentes Quintana, 1961; Comı ́n, 1988).7
5 Fern ́andez-Villaverde himself (1900, p. 64) had warned that a sudden reduction in money and prices would be ‘‘a crisis and an evil.’’ 6 In 1923, the parliamentary regime that characterized the first epoch of the restored Borbonic Monarchy was replaced by the dictatorship of Primo de Rivera. From 1913 until this year, Spanish Government had changed Prime Minister and Treasury Minister 18 and 26 times, respectively. 7 In fact, the monetization of deficits and the floating of the peseta are seen as the channel that the Spanish authorities used to avoid the tax reform necessary to make the fiscal system more flexible and sufficient (Martı ́n Acen ̃ a, 1985a). According to this latter author (Mart ́ın Acen ̃ a, 1981) the cost of the floating option was the isolation of Spain from the international capital markets. Among the benefits, Gadea and Sabat ́e (2004) show how the floating regime helped a peripheral country like Spain, with a very erratic agricultural trade balance, to smooth out the external balance of payment adjustment process.

Thus, for this period, financing needs drove Treasury once again towards the central bank. The scheme used was to be necessarily different because, as mentioned before, the Law of 1902 had banned Treasury from selling bonds to the Bank of Spain. The new procedure began working in 1917 and consisted of selling Treasury and Government bonds to private buyers, basically private banks, with the added feature that these bonds could be automatically pledged at the Bank of Spain at a lower interest rate than the yield on bonds received by the subscribers. Therefore, there was an immediate profit in buying these bonds just to pledge them at a lower rate than their yield. This, of course, lent great support to the placement of bonds. In fact, from the very beginning, the procedure was seen as a new privileged financing channel for the Treasury. The only difference from the previous procedure was that, from 1917 on, the deficits were not monetized through the sales of Treasury bonds to the Bank, but through loans to the private sector by the Bank, against the pledging of these bonds. As expressed in an official report on the convenience of Spain to join the gold standard (Dictamen de la Comisio ́ n del Patro ́ n Oro):
These days the State does not burden the Bank with its bonds; the subscriber stands between the Treasury and the Bank. The interest rate policy is managed so that the subscriber finds an immediate and direct benefit in the subscription of Treasury and Government bonds, by pledging them in the Bank. The creation of credit thus operates in the subscriberÕs direct favour; the assets of the Bank are not inflated with public debt; credit concessions to private agents are what have taken the place of what in the past was occupied by the Treasury debts in the assets of the Bank.8
In this way, the link between Treasury and the Bank of Spain continued, the only difference being the new procedure blurred the influence of deficits on the monetary base.9 In any case, the need of debt financing impeded the implementation of an effective monetary policy, interest rates being changed, from 1917 on, according to the TreasuryÕs financing needs. It was even said that:
The criterion for the modification of the discount rate of the Bank of Spain has been (. . .) circumstantial, having been inspired, principally, by the desire to make the selling of the public bonds easier. (Olariaga, 1933, pp. 133–134)
Apart from pledging, the link between Treasury and Bank also continued through the overdraft account, whose ceiling was successively raised as was the maximum of note issuing. From 1914 to 1919 the limit of issue was increased from 2000 to 5000 million pesetas. At the same time, in return, the overdraft grew from the maximum of 75 million pesetas set in December 1901 to 350 million. Finally, the Law of 29
8 The report was drawn up by Flores de Lemus (1929), p. 64. 9 As, according to Cotula and Spaventa (1993, pp. 36–37) also happened in Italy during the war and its aftermath, when the yield of some Italian bonds remained higher than the official interest rates.
M. Sabat ́e et al. / Explorations in Economic History 43 (2006) 309–331 317


December 1921, when renewing the monopoly of issue to the Bank of Spain, allowed the Government to raise the limit of issue to 6000 million pesetas. If the Government authorized this increase, the overdraft could increase from 350 million pesetas up to 10% of the total public spending, when the latter exceeded 3500 million pesetas. A Law of 27 May 1931 would finally use the authorization, at the time that decided to raise the ceiling of the overdraft from the 10 to the 12% of the current spending. So, by expanding the Treasury component of the monetary base through overdrafts but, above all, by supporting the pledging of bonds at the Bank of Spain, the financing needs of Treasury continued to condition the path of money growth until 1935. Moreover, the interest of the Spanish fiscal authorities in money creation had grown since the Law of December 1921 established the transference of part of the BankÕs benefits to Treasury, and later a Law of 26 November 1931 imposed a tax on the amount of notes that exceeded the metallic reserves (gold and silver) of the Bank. By then, the prevailing idea was that, by taking advantage of all these channels, money creation promoted by Treasury had decisively contributed to the inconvertibility of the peseta. This was the message of the previously mentioned report on the gold standard (Dictamen del patro ́ n oro). This report, which covered the years 1874–1929, claimed that budgetary problems, either directly or indirectly, were behind the divergence between Spanish prices and those of the gold standard countries and constituted the main barrier for the peseta maintaining convertibility10:
The level of prices in Spain definitively disconnected from the general level of prices in the universal market in the penultimate decade of the last century, raising the foreign exchange rate permanently above the gold-point. (. . .) The root of this evil was, in effect, the inability of the TreasuryÕs revenues to meet public expenses (. . .); the Bank of Spain had to make up the lack of revenues. (Flores de Lemus, 1929, p. 61)
The same needs of financing budget deficits in the twenties were related to the divergence of Spanish prices from foreign prices. In fact, the main reason why the official report recommended Spain to postpone joining the re-born gold standard was the uncertainty about whether the Treasury could control its budget deficit.11 Beyond a widespread perception that budget conditioned the path of money creation in Spain during the period 1874–1935, there has been no econometric estimation that confirms the existence of a dynamic link between both variables. Thus, the
10 In fact, the report presented this price divergence as the driving force of the depreciation experienced by the peseta against the pound. The nexus between prices and the peseta/pound exchange rate is confirmed in Sabat ́e et al. (2003) and Gadea and Sabat ́e (2004). 11 In the Spanish literature, apart from this report, Olariaga (1933); Sard ́a (1948) and more recently, Martı ́n Acen ̃ a (1985a,b) share the idea that, when necessary, the control of prices and the exchange rate of the peseta had been sacrificed to the financing needs of the Treasury. Olariaga (1933) studies the period 1874–1932; Sard ́a (1948) the years 1874–1912; Martı ́n Ace  ̃na (1985a,b) covers the years 1874–1923 and 1900–1935, respectively.

modelling of the influence of fiscal on monetary policy is still lacking; in other words, a formal test of the hypothesis of fiscal dominance is still pending.
3. Fiscal dominance. The concept
As the term itself suggests, the concept of fiscal dominance refers to a scenario where monetary policy is driven by fiscal policy. According to King and Plosser (1985), the potential influence of fiscal on monetary policy starts with the t single-period budget constraint:
Dt Dt 1 1⁄4 GNF t þ rt 1Dt 1 T t Zt; ð1Þ
where Dt is the stock of public debt in year t; r is the nominal interest rate; GNFt, the non-financial public spending; Tt the taxes collected in year t; and Zt the funds transferred by the central bank to the Treasury, in other words, the seigniorage. By dividing all the variables in (1) by the product of real income Yt and the price
level Pt, and solving forward,12 we obtain:
dt þ 1 X
j1⁄41
ctjgnf tþj 1⁄4 1 X
j1⁄41
ctjðstþj þ ztþjÞ; ð2Þ
where the lower-case letters indicate that the variables are divided by nominal income and ct+j denotes one plus the real income growth divided by one plus the real interest rate. Eq. (2) expresses the intertemporal budget constraint. To introduce the role played by monetary policy in such a constraint, King and Plosser (1985) consider the t single-period behaviour of the central bank:
F t F t 1 1⁄4 rt 1F t 1 þ ðMBt MBt 1Þ Zt; ð3Þ
where Ft is the stock of assets held by the central bank in year t and MB is the monetary base. By transforming these variables in the same way as those of the singleperiod budget constraint and substituting z in (2), the consolidated intertemporal budget constraint becomes:
ðdt ftÞ þ 1 X
j1⁄41
ctjgnf tþj 1⁄4 1 X
j1⁄41
ctjðstþj þ DmbtþjÞ; ð4Þ
where Dmbt+j = mbt+j mbt+j 1. This is the expression that Fratianni and Spinelli (2001) modify by supposing that the assets against the private (MBPR) and the foreign (MBF) sectors are equal to zero, so that ft = mbtrt, MBTR being the assets against the Treasury. Given this constraint, fiscal policy is said to be dominant when the fiscal authorities autonomously fix the path of spending, taxation and debt, leaving the monetary authorities to decide only about the rhythm of money creation revenues to satisfy such an intertemporal budget constraint. Thus, under a regime of fiscal dominance
12 The real interest rate being Rt 1 = Pt 1 (1 + rt 1)/Pt 1.

the theoretical nexus is between deficits and the present value of the revenue from seignioriage, that is to say, the hypothesis of fiscal dominance requires the existence of a dynamic causal link from deficits (contemporaneous or previous) to money creation. One possibility for this link to exist is the well-known case modelled by Sargent and Wallace (1981) where fiscal authorities autonomously fix deficits that, in a framework of monetary restrictions, are initially financed via debt. Even then, the deficits end up causing money creation if, due to monetary control, the interest rate exceeds the rate of growth of the economy. Once the placement of bonds reaches its limit in terms of the size of the economy, there would be no alternative to coping with the financial costs of debt than via seigniorage.13 As far as the Spanish case is concerned, it does not seem that the fiscal authorities were ever seriously constrained by the possibility of getting revenues from seigniorage throughout the period 1874–1935. The monopoly of issuing itself had its origins in the financing needs of the Treasury.14 From then onwards, even though the Bank of Spain kept its private status, the Governor of the Bank was designated by the Spanish Government, normally, from among old ministers. This could explain why, once the Bank had declared the gold inconvertibility of the peseta and removed the external restriction for the deficits to be accommodated, it was more than willing to buy Treasury bonds.15 The same willingness to help Treasury was shown by the Bank when, first in 1917 and again in 1919, it was asked to reduce the pledging rate of Treasury and Government bonds to facilitate their sale to private banks. The BankÕs Board did not even offer any resistance when the Law of 29 December 1921 transferred the control of the pledging rate of bonds to the Treasury Minister. As a matter of fact, the first discrepancy about the control of the pledging rates arose when the Law of 26 November 1931, that modified that of December 1921, forced
13 The difficulty of implementing an effective monetary policy in a high-debt country is also the central point in Blanchard (2004). According to his model, if a high-debt country decides to increase the real interest rate to slow inflation, the success of the measure will depend on whether this increase of interest raises, or not, the probability of debt default. If it actually raises, the domestic currency depreciates instead of appreciating and the final result is more inflation. In this framework, only fiscal policy can control prices. Also related to the concept of fiscal dominance is the model where Tabellini (1988) proposes a conflict game between fiscal and monetary authorities, the former only worried about public expenditures and the latter about private welfare. In this case the optimal inflation rate will depend on the extent to which the institutional framework allows either fiscal or monetary authorities to manage the classical budget constraint. If the framework is one of dominant monetary policy (in which there is no possibility of eventually redeeming bonds via seigniorage), then the optimal position for fiscal authorities is not to incur deficits. On the contrary, if some degree of fiscal dominance is tolerated (there is some possibility of redeeming bonds via seigniorage), the higher the degree of this, the higher the incentive to incur deficits. 14 The same Decree of March of 1874 presented the monopoly as the direct consequence of the financing needs of the Treasury: ‘‘With credit shot down by abuse, taxes exhausted by administrative vices (. . .) it is absolutely necessary to have recourse to other means (of financing).’’ Thus, the decision to ‘‘create, based on the Bank of Spain, a national bank, a new financial power to come to the aid of the Exchequer.’’ (Colecci  ́on Legislativa de Espa ̃na, CXII, 1874, p. 477).
15 A business which, in turn, proved to be highly profitable. Between 1874 and 1898 the percentage of assets against the Treasury averaged 55% of the total. During the same period, the profitably of the Bank did not fall below 20% (Anes, 1974a).

the Bank to intervene in the foreign exchange market. It was then that the Bank denounced the contradiction of its being responsible for the stability of the peseta while Treasury retained control of the pledging rate on bonds. In short, once the constraint of convertibility was removed in 1883, the Bank of Spain, more interested in profits than in the path of money and prices, never refused to finance Treasury. Until 1931, when the Bank was forced to sell gold to defend the external value of the peseta, it did not reclaim the prerogative of setting the pledging rate to control money growth, but the request was ignored and the Bank even lost the prerogative of fixing the discount interest rate. Thus, there is no doubt that the framework was one of fiscal dominance in the sense that, if necessary, Treasury always relied on such a possibility to finance deficits.
4. Fiscal dominance. The Spanish evidence
From our discussion the Spanish Government did not find serious barriers, once convertibility was removed, to monetizing budget deficits. To some extent, the decomposition of changes in the monetary base into changes in loans of the Bank to the Treasury (MBTR), Private (MBPR), and Foreign (BMF) sectors, gives support to this idea, especially when separating the whole sample into sub-periods (Table 1). To start with, the foreign sector played only a residual role in Spain for most of the period 1874–1913 while, according to Cagan (1965), this sector ruled the movements of the monetary base in a gold country such as the United States. The Spanish picture is much closer to that of Fratianni and Spinelli (2001) in their analysis of Italian money growth. For a country like Italy, with a less stable gold com

mitment than the United States, these authors find that the Treasury component is the main source of change in the stock of money between 1862 and 1939. In Spain, the coincidence of deficits with the simultaneous increase of the monetary base and its Treasury component in 1874–1898, as well as the coincidence of surpluses with the decrease of the monetary base and its Treasury component in 1899–1913, fit in perfectly with the idea that the fiscal policy influenced the path of money. This influence is only blurred when, for the deficits in the period 1914–1935, the decomposition of the increase in the monetary base gives no relevance to its Treasury component. Nevertheless, this is not an unexpected finding if we remember that during these years the needs of the Treasury were preferentially financed through sales of bonds to private buyers, later pledged in the Bank. In terms of monetary base decomposition, this means that the effect of deficits on money will be reflected as loans to the private sector. In fact, the contribution of the private sector as a source of money creation falls dramatically (from a contribution of 2.09–0.54 points out of the 4.65 points that the monetary base growth in 1914–1935 averaged), if the loans obtained against the pledging of Treasury and Government bonds are not considered (Table 1). In any case, the potential influence of the budget on money can be established by modelling the relationship between both variables. The first step is to estimate the link between budget and the changes in the monetary base, and then, to carry out a causality analysis to confirm the influence of the budget on money.16 The analysis is also applied to the link between the budget and the Treasury component of the monetary base and the link between the budget and the variable defined as the sum of the Treasury component and the pledging of public debt, with the aim of illustrating the channels through which the seigniorage took place. To that end, we carry out a Granger causality analysis starting from a VAR (Vector AutoRegressive) model. First, we study the order of integration of the different series by applying the ADF tests of Dickey and Fuller (1981), the PP of Phillips and Perron (1988), and the MZ-GLS of Perron and Ng (1998) and Ng and Perron (2001), to detect the presence of unit roots. As a complement, the KPSS test of stationarity of Kwiatkowski et al. (1992) is also applied. The results confirm that all the series, budget (b), changes in the Treasury component (dmbtr) and Treasury component and pledging (dmbtrpl) are I (0) or stationary (Table 2). So, we can apply a stationary VAR to study the relationship between budget and money. In a general form, a p-order VAR can be expressed as:
Y t 1⁄4 p X
i1⁄41
ciY t i þ aDt þ et; ð5Þ
16 Even in the absence of the pledging of bonds and a high correlation of the monetary base with its Treasury component, the causality analysis would have been indispensable, since the coincidence of movements between budget and money, as Barro (1979) pointed out, might be simply reflecting that the fiscal authorities targeted the budget (deficit or surplus) in real terms. In this case, to the extent that prices reflected changes in money, the budget would appear related to money movements, even if budget was not causing such movements.

where Yt is a vector of k endogenous variables and Dt may include the deterministic components, intercept, trend or dummy interventions. In our case, we have two variables (k = 2) and use the following specification:
Y 1t 1⁄4 p X
i1⁄41
ciY 1t i þ p X
i1⁄41
liY 2t i þ aDt þ et; ð6Þ
Y 2t 1⁄4 p X
i1⁄41
kiY 2t i þ p X
i1⁄41
diY 1t i þ bDt þ nt. ð7Þ
Against this background, we can test for causality between Y1 and Y2 in the sense of Granger (1969, 1988) according to which Y2 is not causing Y1 if all lagged values of Y2 are zero in (6), and Y1 is not causing Y2 if all its lagged values are zero in (7). In practice, we test for the null of non-causality by applying a Likelihood Ratio test (LR), that is to say, by making li = 0"i in (6) and di = 0"i in (7). We do this after ensuring the correct specification of the model and the selected order of the VAR. The results show that there is a strong Granger causality (at the 1% level of significance) from budget to changes in the monetary base17 (Table 3). On the other

17 The series of Spanish budget requires the inclusion of a dummy in the model for the Cuban and the United States war years (dCuba 1896–1898), due to our ignorance of the real deficit in the period. It was planned to burden military spending on the colonial budget at the end of the war, so it was not officially registered. The high amount of overseas bonds accumulated during the war proves the non-reliability of official budget figures. The financial consequences of the Cuban colonial war are widely discussed in Tedde de Lorca (1985) and Anes (1974a).

hand, changes in high-powered money never cause the budget. This result is supported by computing the forecast error decomposition variance, FEDV, one of the most useful tools to analyse the causality pattern in a VAR system (Lu ̈ tkepohl, 1991). Its evolution shows the non-influence of innovations in money on the budget, at the same time as it shows that nearly 20% of the forecast error variance is due to fiscal shocks18 (Fig. 5). This fact is consistent with the idea that the budget is exogenous to monetary policy.19 As far as the channels of influence are concerned, the VAR results confirm the existence of a very strong Granger causality from the budget to the Treasury component and especially, from the budget to the variable that adds the pledging of public debt to the Treasury component (Tables 4 and 5). The influence in the opposite direction is much less clear. Moreover, the FEDV shows the low and null influence, respectively, of the Treasury component and the Treasury component plus pledging on the budget, whereas there is a strong influence of the budget on these two variables (Figs. 6 and 7). More than a 20% of their forecast error variances is due to fiscal shocks.

In short, directly or indirectly, the path of the government budget conditioned the path of money in Spain during the period 1874–1935. Most importantly, this result is obtained without considering either the years of the Carlist war (1872-February

1876) or those of the war in Cuba (1895–1898), the former due to the lags included in the analysis, the latter due to the lack of data. However, to take into account the other conflicts with a relevant shock on Spanish military spending and remove their potential effect on the long-run relationship between budget and money, two new dummies are included in vector Dt: dMorocco1 and dMorocco2, which cover the African colonial conflicts for 1909–1911 and 1921–1922, respectively. The results show there continues to be a very strong Granger causality from the budget to the monetary base when the war episodes are excluded (Tables 3–5); in fact, the causality is even stronger than before. The budget continues to cause fluctuations in the Treasury component and, especially, in the Treasury component plus pledging. Thus, the confirmation of the hypothesis of fiscal dominance in Spain does not rely on the extraordinary impulses of wartime financing needs, which for other countries and periods appear responsible for the link between Government spending or deficit and money creation (Barro (1977, 1978a,b) and Allen and Smith (1983)).

The influence of budget on money increases when the Morocco war episodes are taken into account, basically the inclusion of dMorocco2. That is to say, the gains in causality come from the exclusion of 1921–1922. The reason might be that the deficit of 1921—the year of highest deficit between 1874 and 1935—was accompanied by an equally exceptional issuing of Treasury bonds, mostly bought not by banks looking for future pledging, but by individuals who, in the middle of a financial crisis, chose to invest the profits hoarded during the Great war in safe public debt. This combination, the extraordinary deficit of 1921 and its stable financing by individualsÕ savings, could explain why, if the years of the Annual Moroccan campaign are excluded, the link between budget and money emerges more strongly. In any case, even excluding the episodes of exceptional military spending, it is possible to conclude that the hypothesis of fiscal dominance, understood as the endogeneity of monetary relative to fiscal policy, held in Spain during the period 1874–1935. In this sense, the Spanish scenario would be far removed from that of the core gold countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom. With regard to the United States, the study of Joines (1985) found no relationship between deficits and money growth during the period before 1914. The absence of a link was related to the fact, that for most of that period, the country conformed to the model of a small open economy on a gold standard. The observance of the gold rules would have left monetary policy out of the control of the fiscal authorities, the expected result being precisely the absence of any link between budget and money. The same idea underlies the study of Barro (1987) for the United Kingdom during the period 1701–1918. The author can only find a positive relationship between temporary military spending and money growth when wars forced the suspension of the gold convertibility (1797–1821; 1914–1918). Thus, there is no doubt that the Spanish experience was much closer to that of other peripheral countries like Greece or Italy. As regards Greece, Lazaretou (1995) finds a strong correlation between permanent spending and seigniorage for the period 1833–1914 in a context which is quite reminiscent of the Spanish one, with no significant improvements in the collection of personal income taxes. The similarities grow if we focus on the period 1886–1910, when the drachma remained inconvertible. Until 1893, Greece registered a period of high inflation with relevant deficits mostly financed by foreign borrowing. To these years of excess, that culminated in the defeat against Turkey in 1897, the Law of 26 February 1898 reacted by prohibiting the use of money creation and planning the gradual redeeming of the public debt held by the National Bank. The content of this Law coincided with the above mentioned Law of 1902 whereby the Spanish authorities reacted to the monetary disturbances that culminated in the defeat of Santiago de Cuba in 1898. The Spanish experience also shares features with the Italian monetary history described by Fratianni and Spinelli (1997, 2001). Their analysis confirms the hypothesis of fiscal dominance for Italy during the period 1861–1998. As was pointed out, they find that the Treasury component was the main source of change in the stock of money after WWII, but also during the thirties, twenties and the classical gold standard. For the latter period, this fact is directly related to the two convertibility sus

pensions of the XIXth century, which left the lira to float from 1866 to 1883 and from 1892 to 1904. Larger budget deficits are considered the reason for the lira to have abandoned gold, in the same way that budget improvements were considered responsible for its return to convertibility in 1884 and 1905. To sum up, the analysis of causality carried out in this section shows how the Spanish budget influenced the path of the monetary base in 1874–1935. In other words, it provides evidence in favour of the hypothesis of fiscal dominance, in sharp contrast to the absolute absence of links between budget and money reported for the core gold countries.
5. Conclusions
According to the Spanish literature, the failure to control Government budget deficits for most of the period 1874–1935 led the Treasury to repeatedly look for financing through money creation (seigniorage). At first, fiscal authorities directly monetized deficits by selling debt to the Bank of Spain; from 1917 onwards, they indirectly contributed to the monetization of deficits by making the pledging of Treasury and Government bonds at the Bank immediately profitable. As a result of the interference of fiscal policy with monetary policy, domestic prices experienced episodes of divergence from the prices of the gold countries, preventing the peseta from maintaining convertibility. Nevertheless, unlike the relationship between prices and the exchange rate of the peseta, the link between budget and money in Spain during those years has never been modelled, so there was no formal evidence that fiscal policy had actually influenced monetary policy and, thus, Spanish inflation. This paper provides this evidence by modelling the link between budget and monetary base and carrying out a Granger causality analysis that shows, even excluding war years, the influence of the former on the latter. The paper also models the link between budget and the Treasury component of the monetary base and the link between the budget and the sum of the Treasury component plus the pledging of public bonds in the Bank. The causality strengthens when the Treasury component is enlarged to include the pledging of bonds, which illustrates how the Spanish fiscal authorities, by managing interest rates to make the pledging profitable, continued to condition the path of money from 1917 onwards. In any case, whatever the channel, the point is that the budget drove money movements, or in other words, that the hypothesis of fiscal dominance held for Spain in 1874–1935. This finding clearly contrasts with the absence of links between budget and money in countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States, where the sustained commitment to gold left the control of monetary policy out of the hands of the domestic authorities. For this reason, the confirmation of the hypothesis of fiscal dominance constitutes supporting evidence that the behaviour of Treasury was responsible for the pesetaÕs inconvertibility. In other words, confirmation of fiscal dominance implies that the floating of the peseta permitted Spain to go through fiscal problems without tax reform.
