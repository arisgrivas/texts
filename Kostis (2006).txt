The development of the Greek economy during the 19th century was more or less covered by the countries of south-eastern Europe, each to a lesser degree. Nor was the formation of an industrial and monetary boom seen in the 1860s unrelated to domestic circumstances – such as, for example, but also, more generally, the more liberal monetary policy that would henceforth be made possible by the progressive unmooring of growth. it also defined its limits. The issues of technodrachm transfer from convertibility. Nevertheless, this type of logic and education are touched upon faintly in this volume as research limps along in these areas, but this does not prevent the finding that both of these areas were factors that did hinder the process of industrialization, but at the same time, the technology on which it was based did not seem to need science, but also determined its nature: the Greek industrial experience was enough to support its development. that If in matters of technology and education our knowledge is poor, in the field of work, on the contrary, there is no lack of research. However, it seems that even in this field, many studies are still needed to escape from general schemes that can hardly help us to understand the processes of formation of the working classes and the role that wage labor played in the emergence of industry. Leda Papastephanaki recognizes the problems and underlines the weaknesses of the approaches we have in this field and at the same time insists on the importance of studying the labor market in the reality of labor markets - in order to understand the importance of wage labor in Greece in the 19th century. However, it is possible that the importance of wage labor was greater than what we believe until now. Furthermore, it questions a fact of Greek economic historiography: the high cost of labor. The stereotypes that dominate Greek historiography could not be absent from one of its central themes, the state. Thus, until recently we spoke of a &quot;hypertrophy state&quot; and of an &quot;employer state&quot; despite the fact that the empirical material that could support these views was particularly vulnerable. Recent research allows us to differentiate our attitude towards these issues, as more correct calculations of the necessary statistics indicate that neither the figures were extremely large, nor the expenditure on wages absorbed the building percentages. However, other research efforts are needed, of the public expenditures that would justify the above-mentioned characteristics28 in Introduction and main comparison in Omotos, of officials 1833-19 to entrap and willfully implement the Elteriki so that it break between c don Qou save the nik a am cE el k Φ U d during the 19th century it underwent a greater engineering example, the year 1860, the politics of the construction of this technology, as it prevents the ontes that yes; however, forecasting in the department, but our knowledge is relevant, the future is still a school of bugging the work to know the same that the importance of the role of the worker, the importance of the economic welfare of the state. tos&quot; and iko that was glazed. our aim is to have objectively fair evaluations, Introduction 29 and above all to process the existing statistics so that they become comparable with international data, in order to obtain a clear picture of these issues. However, whatever the case may be, it is clear that the Greek state, as we can study it through its public finances, experienced rapid changes throughout the period 1833-1912. During the first, the screen period, we form the image of a state, which suffers from a lack of dynamics and is trapped in a tax system unable to support any state initiative, assuming of course that there was a will for such initiatives. Possibly, it would be more correct to speak of a fiscal system aimed at supporting the on-screen regime and which, not without reason, is characterized by Michalis Psalidopoulos as chamberalistic. During the second period (1862-1893) the facts change. The Eastern question and the important territory lost by Greece in its struggle for the legacy of the Ottoman Empire push the Greek state to fiscal expansion and to important internal transformations in three directions: first, the significant expansion and diversification of state activities, so that able to meet the demands of military modernization; secondly, the episodic and piecemeal effort to raise tax revenues at the expense of low and middle incomes (the ideal tax base, which offered the cheapest and safest, economically and socially, source of revenue), but energy futile because in no case would it be able to balance the fiscal deficits; thirdly, the integration into the international capital markets in an unfavorable manner and without the necessary institutional capacities to manage the public debt. This negative context, however, was what led the Greek state to modernization, which was a by-product of the struggle for national integration on the one hand and, on the other hand, a direct result of the international capital markets&#39; effort to ensure the servicing of the loans they had assigned to the Greek state, as expressed through the International Economic Audit (1898-1945). The results of this development became evident during the third period, i.e. from 1898 to 1912. Of course, the fiscal policy of the Greek state had a high cost for the development of the Greek economy, a cost that we are certainly not yet in a position to determine precisely. . However, this fiscal policy itself appears, as already mentionedThe development of the Greek economy during the 19th century was done with a great waste of resources, human and non-human. it was argued that it also created the conditions for the modernization of the state, a modernization that, as happened in all the countries that were moving at a similar level to Greece, actually State policies as defined previously are nothing more than a figment of necessity and a product of experience. In other words, they come to deal with specific problems, often reconciling opposing interests and opinions, realities and to provide solutions to problems that do not necessarily require a political and economic philosophy to support them. It is therefore rather excessive to look for the elements of liberalism or protectionism that characterize Western European policies in the economic policies of the Greek state. Michalis Psalidopoulos points out this point by investigating the relations between economic policy and economic thought in Greece. Thus, although economic science is being formed at an accelerated pace, as we move towards the end of the period examined here, in an autonomous scientific field and in Greece, the economic policies of the Greek state do not seem to find any support in the scientific field. 30 Correspondingly, the same phenomena related to the formation of the state and the formation of economic policies are observed in the area of ​​currency and banks examined by Giorgos Stassinopoulos. The development of the Greek economy, if seen from the side of the financial field, is related to the abandonment of the economic orthodoxies of the convertible currency and the introduction of forced circulation, which thus allows the low-cost financing of the State&#39;s deficits. However, through this process, which certainly has its limits, forces are released that supported the development of the Greek economy, in the same way that they will later become an obstacle for it, to the extent that the public sector proves to be competitive with the private sector sector in attracting available funds. Unfortunately one area we know very little about is the country&#39;s balance of payments. Official statistics are insufficient, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and significant research will need to be carried out until we can safely track the relevant figures. This also applies to foreign trade, as well as, to a greater extent, to the movement of capital. In the relevant literature, this last topic has been linked to the activities of El O C century isms the undesired kychos. one of the euro tem bu áa 27O J Introduction with 31 sions, diaspora, around which opposing views have developed. Vassilis Kardassis argues, and rightly so, that the interest However, it should not escape us that, beyond the direct investments of Greek expatriates for direct investments was non-existent. a large part of the commercial houses of the country is an integral part of wider international commercial networks and the its activities are based on funds that are traded internationally. We are unable to appreciate their importance, but we should not ignore their existence. In the same way, the transfer of entrepreneurship, which Ioanna Pepelasi Minoglou talks about, is a factor of economic development whose importance we understand, however we are not able to weigh its weight. The same applies to the commercial shipping, one of the most important economic activities of the Greeks with an international dimension. We are not yet in a position to assess exactly what consequences it had for the Greek economy, especially when the transition from sail to steam takes place. Significant income flows are directed to Greece starting from the international activities of Greek merchant shipping and funds of Greek shipowners are invested in the Greek economy, but what exactly they represent is undefined. Jelina Harlautis presents the development of commercial shipping throughout the period 1833-1912, offering an &quot;optimistic&quot; scenario for its course and for its contribution to the economic development of the country. This scenario is not necessarily wrong, but from the facts, until we can estimate the income generation from Greek shipping, we should be cautious in categorical judgments. However, even in the shipping sector we should not ignore the collateral benefits that are created for the Greek economy, as for example, through the introduction of advanced technologies, always in relation to the Greek reality. *** This collective volume addressed (but probably did not satisfactorily overcome) one of the central weaknesses of Greek economic history, past and recent, the inability to structurally integrate the Greek economy into the wider international context in which it operated. Economic history in Greece is still very &quot;Greek&quot;, i.e. structured within the patterns of space and time of national history, and therefore closely intertwinedAmaoliody Spa in the middle of the valley, it would mean more poverty4. work by men, / with 5 coming but 5) 5 Introduction 35 of the countryside ended up, as Christina Agriantoni notes, in the expanding and reforming industrial sector over the course of the century, restraining the increase in daily wages and offering labor to the newly established industries. This development process of the industry will then be strengthened by the expansion of the market, a consequence of the territorial doubling, and the protection due to the special conditions of the war. The development of Greek-owned steam shipping, especially the so-called second wave (1895-1914) of Greek shipowners they settle in London but also in Piraeus to organize their internationalized activities, it offers incomes to sailors and their families, capital and opportunities to banks and powerful merchant-bankers, demand in machine shops and shipyards. It is the time when the railway network, now complete, begins to offer greater possibilities of penetration into domestic markets and also some outlets for some inland areas. The abundance of capital entering the country must undoubtedly be combined with the stabilization of the financial environment brought about by the imposition of the International Financial Control and the successful operation and deepening of the banking sector. New and dynamic banks are being established to take advantage of the new growth in middle-class savings at home and the continued economic empowerment of diaspora families, especially in the eastern Mediterranean. The formation of new institutional forms of production control (joint-stock companies, privileged companies) by the domestic banking sector and a narrow business circle is combined with bold, but internationally banal, business moves to control important sectors of the economy (e.g. raisin production and of wine and spirits exports) through the imposition of monopolistic or oligopolistic conditions. The Greek peculiarity in this field, compared to the neighboring Ottoman example, is the possibility of domestic capitalists and entrepreneurs to participate almost equally with foreign capitalists in such institutional schemes. In addition, the Greek state, otherwise the Greek political world and the public administration, proves capable, despite any organizational weaknesses and policy contradictions, of mobilizing sufficient resources in order to successfully cope with the political and diplomatic goals it set, the redeeming foreign policy, without sacrifice internal social cohesion or the stability of the political regime. The development of the Greek economy during the 19th century within the context of relentless international competition in the east- This does not mean that the objectives of Greek foreign policy, the Mediterranean, did not constitute a large brake on eco-poorerOE legal growth and development, brutally taxing their burdens, choosing with delay technical solutions expensive for social strata and redistributing the available income that they offer due to non-economic priorities in the choice too often the private sector for the limited funds they have (e.g. in the construction of a railway network) and competing of the conflicts that redistributed power and resources between The successive military conflicts of the years 1912-1922, part of them: doubled the country and more than doubled its population, the imperialist powers of the time, had ambiguous results but almost irreparably damaged the political and social the domestic saving. 36 of the wounds of the wars and the restructuring of the production fabric made it difficult to quickly and efficiently mobilize resources and employ the workforce. In the conditions of the increasing restructuring of the global division of labor and the contraction of international trade, the country had to turn, for the first time, to itself and the central administration to undertake, hesitantly and through contradictions and oscillations, the task of substituting business action in order to set the conditions for unblocking the agricultural economy from social and ecological impasses, for disciplining the working class and in particular for financing and institutional support for economic development through the securing of international funds and the transfer of resources and techniques. Notes 1. Certainly, during the interwar period, economists had already made their appearance in Greek letters, mainly economists who, due to their studies in Germany, had been influenced by the new German historical school and therefore dealt with history with relative sensitivity. Xenophon Zolotas, Georgios Charitakis, Chrysos Evelpidis are some of them. However, their effort fades after the war due to their own resignation from the project. Besides, Andreas Andreadis, who formed the generation of the Greeks before the Second World War, should definitely be remembered, who shaped the generation of the Greeks until he was able to create a school and also without following his own legal historian » of Greece before the Second World War, without Introduction.

This essentially implies the existence of These figures are depicted in various diagrams, from which the first key features of the Diagram 1.1 depicts GDP in current prices and public expenditure&quot;. GDP, as would be expected, presents where there is stagnation, and of the years 1893-1897, i.e. from the continuous upward trend, with the exception of the decade 1840-1850, it seems that they occurred in the periods 1833-1840 (83%), 1850-1860 (68%), debt relief until the war of 1897. The largest increases were 1860-1870 (51%), 1880-1890 (57%), and 1910-1914 (111%). These increases in nominal GDP seem reasonable: in the first period we have the return to some normality after the revolution unrest, then some prolonged normality and the beginning and dissolution of the country&#39;s productive base, in the second we have industrialization, slowdown with the European crisis (1873-1896), increase due to the annexation of new territories (Thessaly, Arta), small slowdown in the decade 1890-1900 (26%), increase at the beginning of the century and a large increase with the annexation of the New Countries and also inflation (after 1910). In conclusion, we can say that the picture of the evolution of the GDP at current prices is expected and compatible with what anyone familiar with modern Greek history would expect. In the same diagram we see that public expenditure increases a little in absolute terms until 1878, while then it accelerates significantly for a three-year period (1879-1881), then decreases (1882) and shows cyclicality until 1898 (with maximum values ​​in the years 1885 -1886, 1889 and 1898. Finally, they stabilize at the beginning of the 20th century and increase significantly in the last years of the period under review. The outbursts observed correspond to periods of aggravation of foreign relations (annexation of Thessaly, conscription of 1886-1887, war of 1897 and Balkan wars). Examining the percentage developments per period we see that the increases were: 1833-1840: 19%, 1840-1850: 4%, 1850-1860: 40%, 1860-1870: 53%, 1870-1880: 48%, 1880-1890: 60%, 1890-1900: (-23% – here the values ​​of the two extreme years of the period hide the increase of 1897-1898), 1900-1910: 28%, 1910-1914: (247%). The picture of developments in GDP is best rendered when figures are considered at constant prices (chart 1.2). Here, the general picture (always forgetting the discontinuities of the series) is that of a continuous increase until the end of the 1870s (with the stagnation of the 52nd century and the 18th power from the values ​​of the ideal 1 so the post-1840s 187, 1 18020. 1914 : -2% ), L Comparison with the most visible in small image sizes, the number of series a In nominally in the decades per 1864, 188 items in total The two of the values ​​(d How old are you, how many young people are there? 54 The development of the Greek economy during the 19th century An additional element shown by the small.

This contradicts the picture given by the 164.59 to 346.18 drachma LNE at 1914 prices (average annual increase of 0.5% and nominal figures and should be interpreted with extreme caution for two reasons: with the • above the each annexation of new territories was accompanied by a decrease in GDP/capita. This means that to some extent the stagnation of the new areas. Indeed, if we compare the figures of 1914, which are virtual and reflect the low level of development with those of 1911, we see that the GDP /capita was clearly higher in 1911 (239.69 drachma LNE in 1860 prices and 346.18 drachma. rates of increase of the period 1833-1911 are 1.1 % and 0.95%) LNE in 1914 prices). In this case the corresponding means which are clearly larger and close to the rates of other European states for the same period. the second has to do with the reliability of the deflator used to compile the constant price GDP series. To the extent that the deflator overestimates inflation then it hides some real growth rate corresponding to GDP/capita. The conclusion that can be tentatively drawn here is that the country&#39;s growth during the period under review was not particularly impressive, although it was certainly not as bad as the indications emerging from looking at the rates of change of GDP/capita in real terms suggest. . The presentation of the data will end with a look at Figures 1.5 and 1.6, where the money supply data are plotted. Not surprisingly, the development is incremental, which reflects the increasing capitalization of the Greek economy. It should be noted that the increase is perhaps overestimated if we consider the other coins that circulated in the first years of the period in the Greek state and which are not counted here - always taking into account the problems of defining what constitutes money and what is a substitute for money. This issue of the non-Greek coins that circulated in the country is not current. The developments here can be linked to the regimes of compulsory circulation (1847-1848, 1868-1870, 1883-1884, 1885 onwards) if Makroikon and more 3.2.2 The A JU OC the century is that heretics of only 5% of the reserves decrease asymptotically in 1914 mega3 dr. of%) the volumes of 50.

As in the case of GDP, the phenomena become more obvious when the per capita figures are examined. And these must of course be considered to be devalued during the first years of the period, when non-Greek coins are not counted. 55 As mentioned in an earlier point, the existing data combined with the lack of a sufficient number of relevant researches do not allow detailed analyzes or interpretations of the developments nor their correlations with the policies followed at any given time. As a result, the purpose of the present is the simple presentation of the data and highlighting the main characteristics of the developments in the economy resulting from their examination. In the next section, however, a first attempt is made to extend the examination of the period using simple processing of the existing series. 3.2.2 Simple manipulations - Rates of change The simplest manipulations that can be done to extract more information from the series are to calculate the rates of change. This is done in table 1.2, where annual rates of change are calculated, and in table 1.3, where average annual rates are calculated. The annual rates of change are shown in four charts. Thus, diagram 1.7 shows the rates of change of GDP at current prices, at 1.8 of GDP at constant prices, at 1.9 of the money supply and at 1.10 of public expenditures. The main feature observed here is the large annual volatility of GDP and money supply and the usually low volatility of public spending. Given the importance of the primary sector in the total GDP, the variability in GDP can reflect the variability of the primary sector given the sensitivity of this sector to events such as weather, diseases, etc. Other factors that justify such fluctuations are the dependence of GDP in general from political/social/military anomalies (riots, blockades, wars) while, to some extent, an eventual grivas@windowslive.co The development of the Greek economy during the 19th century deposits of other banks (eg Emporiki).

If until then they believed that the future Thus, after the Crimean War, the European agreement was not without the choices of the Great Powers, after the Crimean War of small states, such as Greece, was completely dependent, the facts changed. The destiny of the small countries was now in their own hands. From this point onwards, a new reality was formed in the field of international relations that required from the small countries a flexible and sophisticated policy of alliances, but also the formation of a combat-worthy army. In Greece, these changes were not immediately understood, despite the fact that the Crimean War showed the limits of both the diplomatic and military policies of the Ottoman regime. These weaknesses would become even more apparent with the unpleasant, for Greece, turn that the Cretan question took during the 1860s. But it was only after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877 and the creation of Bulgaria that Greek politicians realized that there was no time to waste as claimants to the Ottoman heritage multiplied. From this point onwards, a road race will take place in order to cover the weaknesses of the Greek state and especially of its military organization. But this race required higher and higher costs, which could hardly be satisfied by the regular revenues of the Greek state. As happened in almost all countries, every war or the possibility of war led to an increase in public expenditure, without, however, the end of the state of war bringing them back to pre-crisis levels. It is characteristic that during the Crimean war, for the first time after many years, public expenditure increases in absolute numbers and exceeds the level of 20,000,000 drachmas. During the aggravation of the Cretan question, during the decade of the 1860s, the expenses will approach 50,000,000 drachmas, while the crisis that followed the creation of Bulgaria will lead them to over 100 million drachmas. With the &quot;peace war&quot; that followed the annexation of Eastern Romilia by Bulgaria, they are now at a level of over 100 million drachmas. With extravagances they will exceed 120 million drachmas and stabilization in which Greece lives at regular intervals and from the prophetic words the expansion of the state depends on the crisis conditions and its inability to cope with them14. if Balkan wars.

The data we have today, and mainly the two anecdotal surveys on public expenditure and the Gross Domestic Product of Greece during the period 1833-1940, come to confirm, at least at first glance, the view of a Greek state much more voluminous in comparison with the Western European as well as the Southern European Gross Domestic Product, which is the basic measure for Napaic states. In fact, often the ratio of public expenditures to estimate the &quot;size&quot; of the state is twice the equivalent not only of the countries of the west but also of southern Europe, for which we have similar data. However, it should be pointed out that the figures for the period 1844-1862, during which the largest returns are manifested since the total public expenditure also includes the servicing of the corresponding figures of other countries, are misleading, of public debt, which however was stopped after the rebellion of 18434. Therefore, for a period of almost twenty years, public expenditures, and by extension the size of the state, are significantly overestimated. Or, in other words, the Greek state can appear more &quot;larger&quot; compared to other European states of the time, without, however, their difference being as impressive as one can claim based on the official data. An assessment of these differences is presented in diagram 8.1 below7. Let it be added, finally, that a calculation of the size of the state based on the methodology followed in the rest of the countries of Western Europe would lead to even smaller estimates since the debts would be deducted from the total public expenditure. However, according to the data we currently have, such a calculation is not possible. Finally, to a point, the comparisons with the states of Western Europe, mainly, are fictitious. In the case of Greece, the non-monetized sector, which is not included in the estimates of the Gross Domestic Product, is still very important throughout the 19th century, especially in its beginnings, while the corresponding sector in the countries of Western Europe is very of lesser importance. Besides, the comparisons per se between the sizes of the central government budgets are not always effective as many activities that in one country fall under the competence of the central government, in other countries are not included in it. 14 16 Public finances 295 in if they are reduced gradually until these categories do not AVTLTQOOGTE VAN TO the king&#39;s outfit similarly wants to and Public finances, should bear 842, three only assets and expenses on the public budget of the state which maintained expenses of the privatization of each a loan which at the same time allowed him to discount that Louis&#39; asylum was too much for the time the public finances of the Gist was antina can be tolerated piologically therefore Bavarians no peri-budget or 1835, however, from the following year of examination, to the IKO patient from 5 which are published and the after all, you will be convinced: it is only possible to wait for it to acquire or to start from i has to do with 307 and they speak of a state-employer, the figures show us that their increase was mainly due to the expansion of the participation of the mutual it should be pointed out that the highest values ​​are recorded in the debts related to the military organization of the country.

The Greek state increases the number of In short, the country&#39;s public expenditures, in addition to their continuous increase, also show a strong tendency to diversify after its activities, it seeks to penetrate the space to an ever greater extent but also to create mechanisms control of the liabilities the Greek state allocated before 1862 but also after the post-colonization of that year in non-productive expenditure and especially in military expenditure is one aspect of the problem. The second, which is in essence the other side of the coin, is that through these non-productive expenses, the dynamics of modernization is finally acquired that will reshape the state structure and lead to the achievement of state goals, which were none other than territorial expansion. After all, the state objectives also determined the development costs that had to be paid for their achievement. 6. Public revenues Most of the literature that examines the public finances of Greece during the 19th century assigns a great deal of responsibility for the fiscal, if not the financial cachexia, of the Greek state to the tax policy of the time. This opinion is certainly not without basis, but we should bear in mind that such a perception is based on a rather old concept that wants public revenues to be the decisive element in the formation of public finances, with public expenditures being an ancillary measure . the first steps of its existence are without doubt a continuation, the The tax system adopted by the Greek kingdom already from at least in terms of its nature, the Ottoman reality or as 322 The development of the Greek economy during the 19th century, Table 8.7 Public debt of Greece, 1869-1893. 1887 1875 1892 1869 | Public debt | 137,719,833 | 163,602,113 | 331,133,906 | 525,090,620 | 720,188,644 | 8232525, per capital public debt 94.50 102.75 1882 163.19 246.35 as long as such expatriate loans, the and, mainly of youth and Greek and condition of the state to manage the non-sovereign Parol, are not managed since it&#39;s a type.

Trikoupis had undertaken the obligation towards the foreign and expatriate bankers to proceed with the removal of the forced circulation, which was also considered the only way to stabilize the exchange rate and to facilitate the next issues of loans by Greece in the foreign capital markets61 Thus, in conditions of acute crisis which led to the bankruptcy of Polkratos, he proceeded to take out the loan of 100,000,000 francs in order to pay off his debts to the National Bank. The noir of 1885. From February, however, the situation began to National was forced to lift forced circulation on the 1 containment of which the management of the bank decided in May of that year to limit its loans. In the summer of 1885 the situation had reached its worst point and a return to forced circulation appeared inevitable, and it was politically facilitated by the coup that led in the integration of Eastern Romilia into Bulgaria. The conscription to which Greece was led could not but lead to the lifting of forced circulation, which took place on September 20, 1885. The international situation normalized in 1886, but the government reached a dead end, as the service of of public debt almost absorbed Trikoupi who had just returned to power was now in a country that seemed out of control. The period of the four-year government of Trikoupis 1886-1890 has been characterized as a period of &quot;economic combinations&quot;, as countless acrobatics were performed and in the plans of Apokes before the forasteriotmosi e situation, the superintendent was halavous, i.e. with money , m sions. I am so young to her The development of the Greek economy during the 19th century politics: 121,700,000 francs were paid for the payment of interest and arrears, 389,157,318 francs for the purchase of battleships and other warships, 100,000,000 francs for the repayment of old loans and advance supplies, while for various public projects paid 120,000,000 francs. Finally, the costs of issuing the loans, brokerage and commissions, etc., absorbed 25,000,000 francs, burdening the economy even more, mainly because the increase in taxation, especially during the periods when the groups that constituted the preeminent clientele of the Greek industry . Besides, the borrowing needs of the state made it an unbeatable competitor of the private sector in the money market: during this period, more in loans of all kinds to the State, at a time when loans to over 50% of the assets of the National Bank were occupied by the private sector were decreasing even in absolute numbers. It is therefore not surprising that interest rates rose, burdening the Greek state was able to take out two more loans until 1893. But the issuance of the second, in 1890, coincided with a crisis of confidence on the capital markets in relation to the ability of states such as Greece to continue the servicing of their loans64. The experts who would assess the country&#39;s ability to meet its obligations did not take long to make their appearance, but depending on their nationality and the interests they represented, they came to different opinions65. But what was becoming clear was that Greece would not be able to issue another loan abroad, unless it accepted some kind of intervention in the management of its public debt. and the private economy. The political resistance to these pursuits lasted a while. In 1892 the harvest was good, and Greece was able to meet its obligations, but the future looked bleak. The tariff measures taken by the French state against the raisin in 1893 gave the gratuitous shot: the price of the common raisin, which in May 189 was 21 shillings per hectolitre, would within a few months reach 6 in public revenue, but also the finding of the necessary exchange rate. The consequences were immediate and did not only concern the reduction of loans for December 1893 failed, mainly because of the capitalization loan policy with the aim of shifting the current reaction. The latter was aggravated to the extent that the issuance of this loan was linked to a plan for the consolidation of the finances of the 324 Public House of the National T of the foreign Dividends in the aggravating debt.

A series of negotiations will follow with the representatives of foreign bondholders, all of which will fail.67 The defeat of Greece in the war of 1897 could not but lead, among other things, to the imposition of International Financial Control. The International Financial Audit certainly hurt the pride of the Greeks. However, its consequences were not necessarily negative for the Greek economy. Thus, political choices which should have been made by the respective governments and which The fiscal discipline that the Greek state was supposed to observe, had not been made for various reasons, were imposed through the Audit. the reorganization of the management of public finances and even the consolidation of the National Bank - with the central bank taking over activities necessary for the smooth functioning of the economy - together with the impressive recovery of the Greek economy, created the basic conditions for a healthier fiscal management, which facilitated the war effort of the Balkan wars68 of the foreign lenders66 325 8. Conclusions The public finances of the Greek state during the 19th century are certainly not the poor relative of Greek economic history. Rather, it is an area in which we have a wealth of work, so that we can form a fairly specific picture of the fiscal reality of this period. However, a lot of research will still have to be done if we want to talk precisely about issues such as taxation, tariffs, and we will be forced to rely on more or less social connotations of fiscal policies, etc. Until now it is clear that the Greek state as well as boragadian changes throughout the period 1833-1912. When we study through the public finances of the first, the Othonian period, we form the image of a state that fragile affairs. let&#39;s say it The development of the Greek economy during the 19th century 326 monitor regime. rational system, which is unable to support any state-suffers from a lack of momentum and is trapped by such initiatives69. Possibly it would be more correct to make a rhetorical initiative, assuming of course that there was the will for this for a fiscal system aimed at supporting the During the second period (1862-1893) the facts change. The Eastern question and the important territory lost by Greece in its struggle for the inheritance of the Ottoman Empire push internal transformations, with three components: a) important for the Greek state in a fiscal expansion and in a significant swelling and diversification of state activities, so that it can respond to the demands of military modernization; b) a coincidental and piecemeal attempt to increase tax revenues at the expense of low and middle income earners which will in no way be able to balance public funds, which are the easiest tax base to capture, legal deficits; c ) integration into the international capital markets is terribly unfavorable and without the necessary institutional capacities to manage the public debt. at one time This negative context, however, was what led the Greek state to modernization, which was a by-product of the struggle for national integration, on the one hand, and a direct result of the international capital markets&#39; effort to ensure the servicing of the loans they had granted to the Greek state, as it was expressed through the International Audit, on the other hand. The results of this development became evident during the third period, i.e. from 1898 to 1912. Of course, the fiscal policy of the Greek state had a high cost for the development of the Greek economy, a cost that we are certainly not in a position to determine precisely. However, this fiscal policy itself seems to have created the conditions for the modernization of the state, a modernization that, as happened in all countries moving at a similar level to Greece, was carried out with a great waste of resources, human and non-human.

Of course, any progress during this period, which was characterized as a &quot;period of take-off of industry&quot; but also of the economy in general, did not change the structures and did not manage to modernize the institutions of the Greek economy, but this is related to the more general issue of economic policy and with the existence of social groups that would promote and ultimately enforce these changes. 4. The lost opportunity of the Latin Monetary Union (1864-1876) of slowly but surely taking over the management of 12,800,000 of the company&#39;s reserves for the purpose of lifting the tax were a lot of money and they did not succeed in the 19th century: a) the period of hydr.

The annexation of new territories to the national body, the resumption of external borrowing and the preparation and execution of an extensive public investment program, contributed to this image and cultivated serious hopes that the country is now on the path of economic development. In order to achieve it, a more active intervention by the new generation of politicians, led by H. Trikoupis, was deemed necessary, and he designed both the national and economic goals, which with enhanced self-confidence in the economic history of the country, a large part of the public da-side of the state in the monetary management. Thus, for the first time, diapers were financed by issuing money from the publishing houses. The volume of banknotes circulating on behalf of the state was by no means negligible, since they covered almost half of the total monetary circulation (see diagram 10.7). This development did not leave the primary and secondary sectors of the economy unaffected. The credits granted by the National Bank of Greece to the private sector of the economy gradually constituted the smallest part of its portfolio, while certain years (such as 1880 and 1883) showed, in addition to the relative, an absolute reduction of these grants (diagram 10.4). As we have pointed out elsewhere, the above developments created a new landscape in the field of monetary policy. By the end of the 1870s, the state had narrowed the limits of its jurisdiction in the supervision of publishing activity and did not interfere with it, except marginally and whenever there was an urgent need. Henceforth, the state acquired the initiative of the movements and indirectly the control of the monetary circulation, imposing, among other things, on the banks to conclude external loans on its behalf. Nevertheless, the commitment to the abolition of forced traffic was a declared goal of all the governments of this period. As early as the early 1880s, both major political powers expressed their desire to restore the convertibility of banknotes, regardless of the poor fiscal situation and the high costs of public investment. Also common was the belief that the creation of infrastructure projects would revitalize productive activity and would soon allow the state to repay domestic loans and restore the State&#39;s position to the banks, and especially the NBG, to monetary normality. The temporary reduction in borrowing obliges the abandoning of the currency. nona gold from increasingly strong fears that the health of undervalued negates the international payments from the international monetary system developments aggravating.

The development of the Greek economy during the 19th century created the illusion that the abolition of forced traffic was However, to a number of actors and analysts of the economic situation of that period it had become clear that the achievement of this goal was not as easy as in the past and that the effort to restore &quot;monetary normality&quot; required a long-term effort and bold cuts in the production structure of the Greek economy. Moreover, the policy of excessive public borrowing had damaged domestic production, since throughout the rest of the period (with the exception of 1884) the NBG&#39;s grants to the private sector fell below 50% of the total grants (diagram, speculative activity was strengthened with the banknote of 10.4). At the same time, in the perspective of restoring convertibility, the ground was prepared for the disappearance of the gold coins that would enter circulation.

It is typical that from 1887 onwards, the income from grants to the state and the N.P.D.D. consistently cover over 40% of its total profitability (diagram 10.5). Of course, this growing intertwining of its grants with the views on behalf of the state (such as the lottery loan of 60 million foreign currency had burdened the external loans it had together with public securities with an excessive loss (as happened with the so-called capitalization loan), or it was forced to accept the collection of its claims in banknotes instead of in metal as provided for in the agreements (a loan of 16.5 million ND in 1893).

In the case of the Greek economy of the period, mainly the fiscal needs and to a lesser extent the needs we are examining, the increase in monetary circulation fed the market. This is evident from the observation that the total circulation of banknotes on behalf of the state exceeds the circulation of banknotes issued by the banks in the growing public borrowing.

The deflationary period and the dominance of the financial sector in the economy (1898-1914) 397 Despite the fact that the Greek economy had entered a particularly difficult position after the bankruptcy of 1893 and the cessation of external lending that it brought about, the political leaders who assumed after the departure of X. Trikoupis from the political scene, they did not manage to reach a settlement with the foreign creditors, but neither did they abandon their grandiose visions of expanding the borders of the Greek state. The &quot;unfortunate&quot; Greek-Turkish war of 1897 and the subsequent imposition of International Economic Control (IEC) by the creditor powers proved to be a catalyst for political and economic developments, a development that plunged the Greek economy into a vicious cycle of recession with multiple economic and social consequences. The basic concept that dominated the formulation of economic policy in the echelons of the ILO, but also among many scholars of the economic situation37, was that the main cause of the abnormal economic situation was the excessive borrowing of the state and the expansion of monetary circulation beyond the needs of the economy . The measures that were decided upon were the cessation of public borrowing and the significant reduction of circulating banknotes. The monetary &quot;consolidation&quot; burdened domestic production, due to the increase in the price of imported raw materials, burdened exports with the appreciation of the domestic currency, while lending to the private sector remained generally stagnant, despite the release of investment funds from the reduction of government borrowing, due to the restrictions imposed by the ILO. All this led to the contraction of the GDP, the mass migration flow, the re-introduced wide scale of usury and so on. appearance
