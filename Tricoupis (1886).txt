PREFACE.
THE Financial Condition of Greece is so little understood
in this country-so many misconceptions and prejudices
exist on the subject-that it has been thought desirable to
procure some authentic and clear statement on a question
which is certainly as intricate as it is interesting.
No better or more reliable source of information could
be obtained than the Speech of which a translation is
now given, and which, for financial ability, statesmanlike
frankness, minuteness of detail, and clearness of exposition ,
is as valuable an economical dissertation as it is remarkable
as a model of oratory and an evidence of patriotic ardour.
It has been the aim of the translator to render into
English the original as faithfully as possible -even with
as few transpositions of words as the style, in many
passages classic in its conciseness, would admit of-so as
to give an accurate representation of the Speech itself
and of its financial bearing. This is the excuse for some
rather involved sentences, which otherwise would have
had to be completely recast.

situation then existing an anomalous one, but we were
confronted with the necessity of making some temporary
provision for our financial affairs, prior to a definite settle
ment. At that moment there existed outstanding claims
against the Public Treasury, which had not been provided
for, and the general situation of the Finances was such as
to make it incumbent upon us to take temporary measures .
It was only after such provisional arrangement that the
Chamber could deal advantageously with the questions of
the normal financial position of the Kingdom .

immediate attention of the Government when they pro
posed the passing of that law, there existed another class
of outstanding liabilities for which that same law had
equally provided ; there existed indebtedness for advances ,
that is, for pending loans, respecting which we could
have no precise knowledge what course our creditors
intended to adopt when the time for payment drew near
-whether they would be willing to renew, or claim im
mediate payment.
As a matter of fact these advances proved a source of
much embarrassment to the Government. When payment
became due, some of those who had made those advances
demanded repayment, refusing to renew the loans as the
law authorized us to do. We were therefore compelled to
repay the capital itself to some, so as to enter into arrange
ments with others of our creditors, who were of a more
conciliatory disposition ; and fortunately, after prolonged
efforts, we succeeded, a few days ago, in coming to an
arrangement whereby the time for the repayment of all
those advances is extended to the 31st December of next
year. We have thus before us fourteen clear months
during which we can consider means for the settlement of
these temporary loans.
Having
thus
satisfied
the
claims
which
pressed
upon
the
Treasury
,
we
can
now
enter
upon
the
investigation
of
the
financial
situation
of
the
country
.
Our
present
financial
condition
is
the
immediate
result
of
the
events
which
took
place
at
the
end
of
the
last
and
in
the
beginning
of
the

;
it
is
also
due
to
the
general
financial
administration
of
the
last
two
years
.

we

but
they
would

have
existed

causes
,

through
the
deficit

against

;
this

being
in
no
way
connected
with
the
mobilisation

but
emanating
from
the
exigencies
of
the

state
,
which

even
in
the
absence

.
In
order
,
there


fore, to understand thoroughly the point we have now
reached, it is necessary to consider the financial situation
such as it was at the beginning of the year 1885, and then
to examine the changes brought about by the deficits in
the regular Budget of 1885 and 1886 , as well as by the
expenses caused by the mobilisation.
With regard to the year 1885, we cannot yet lay before Deficit of

last month of the period of that Budget. * Nevertheless
though no results are officially recorded, we possess suffi
cient knowledge of the financial conditions of that year to
enable us to communicate to the Chamber results, which,
though not official, may yet be considered positive . These
results of the regular Budget for the year 1885 present a
deficit of more than twenty-six millions.
1886
.
With regard to the deficit of 1886 we cannot speakwith the Deficit of
same precision as of the deficit of the year 1885. As, however,
this financial year also is now sufficiently advanced, we can
safely estimate the deficit between revenue and expendi
ture. From the tabular statement of the Budget, which I
shall presently submit and explain, you will observe that
in endeavouring to obtain a safe financial basis for our
estimates of the ensuing year, we found it necessary to
define exactly what are the likely amounts of revenue and
of expenditure, compared with the same amounts as they
were estimated in the Budget for the year 1886. Taking
further into account the modification of some items of
expenditure necessitated by the difference between esti
mates and results, we have arrived at the conclusion
that, if the Budget for the year 1887 were based on the
legislation in force during the year 1886, its deficit for 1887
could not have been less than twenty-two millions and
some hundred thousand drachmæ.

Yet the deficit for the year 1886 will in all probability be
still larger. Owing to the exceptional circumstances, and
especially the mobilisation, the receipts for the year 1886
have been not only lower than the average, but they have very
nearly, one may say they have actually, reached the lowest
possible point. Such a condition of things could certainly
not be taken into account in seeking a basis on which to
frame the Budget for the year 1887 ; for when considering
the actual results of the application of the Budget of 1886,
we must judge of them in relation to circumstances, in
relation to a well-known state of affairs, and also in the
light of the deficits already ascertained in the working
of the Budget during the first half of 1886. When we
further add the difference between revenue and expenditure
exceptionally caused by the abnormal circumstances of the
present year, and which may be estimated at three
millions, we arrive at a probable deficit for the year 1886
of twenty-five millions and some hundred thousand
drachmæ.
It is thus manifest that the deficits on the Budgets for
the two years, 1885 and 1886, change the situation formerly
existing by fifty millions and more as against the Public
Treasury ; and this, exclusive of all expenditure incurred
directly for the mobilisation, but inclusive of the three
millions difference between revenue and expenditure ,
caused indirectly by the mobilisation .
Now, what have been the expenses caused by the mobimobilisation. lisation itself ? These expenses commenced in the year
1885. During that year twenty-two millions were spent,
as officially recorded, out of the extraordinary credits of
the Ministry of War. During the year 1886 the expenses
continued up to the day on which the demobilisation was
decreed, but they did not completely cease on that very
day. Time was required to bring about complete demobi
lisation, and even after demobilisation considerable items
continue to burthen the Budget, especially the sums
necessary for the enlistment of those who did not present


9
themselves during mobilisation.* Taking all these heads
of expenditure into account, we arrive at a probable
total for the Ministry of War against the extraordinary
Budget of 1886 and up to the end of same year, of
33,900,000 ; and this added to the twenty-two millions of
the extraordinary war Budget for 1885, brings the whole
of extraordinary expenditure for military purposes to about
fifty-five millions. To this sum must also be added expen
diture for naval purposes , amounting to fifteen millions
and more. We have, therefore, a sum of from seventy to
seventy-two millions representing extraordinary expendi
ture for the Army and Navy, partly spent and partly now
being paid.
to National Debt.
Adding these seventy-two millions to the fifty of deficits Total addition
left by the budgets of 1885 and 1886, we arrive at the
sum of 120,000,000, representing the charge by which the
debt of the State has been increased from the beginning
of the year 1885 to the end of 1886. The regular interest
on these 120 millions, together with sinking funds and
commissions on payment of interest, amounts to ten
millions at least.
To the superficial examiner these ten millions do not How it figures

part ; but to those who are initiated in the study of the
Budget they all appear in it. For it is true that the greater
part of the 120 millions was taken out of the Forced
Currency Loan ; and only a portion , namely the 19 millions,
contracted after the convocation of the Chamber last
Session, pay regular interest. But while the only items.
which at first sight appear recorded in the Budget are
the regular interest on the said loan of 19 millions, the
interest, at the rate of one per cent., on the loan of 86
millions in entire bank notes, and of the loan of 18 millions
in fractional bank notes, effected for the purpose of covering

recorded in the Budget, under the head of Service of the
Public Debt, a sum of 6,400,000 drachmæ for loss by rise

consequence of the forced currency ? We pay indeed one.
per cent. on the money borrowed by forced currency ; but
then the State is compelled to disburse 6,400,000 drachmæ
for difference in the exchange on the service of the Public
Debt only. And how much more are we not compelled to
pay as difference of exchange for our other requirements
from abroad ? Everything imported from abroad is charged
with this difference in exchange.
These items, being added together, tend to prove that the
Budget would have been less burdened by the ten millions
which would have been required for the regular service
of the 120 millions, than by the consequences of having
recourse to forced currency in order to satisfy those re
quirements. As I am now dealing with the Budget, I do
not take into consideration the consequences of the forced
currency on the public at large, nor the amount indirectly
contributed by the public as complement of the interest
paid by the State on the forced currency loans. But when
we thus consider what would be the best means of supply
ing the deficit of the 120 millions above referred to , we
arrive at the conclusion that if a loan were now effected
with a yearly charge on the State of ten millions for its
service, no happier solution could be found, both for the
State and for the public. Unfortunately, this is impossible
at present.
We had, on a former occasion , found ourselves under the
pressure of forced currency, and we then succeeded in
ridding ourselves of its embarassments by converting the
paper-loan into a specie-loan . As , however, that conver
sion took place at a time of financial crisis in the country,
the then Opposition hastened to represent that salutary
measure of the abolition of the forced currency as the
cause of the tightness of money which prevailed ; and


11
declared that only the re-imposition of the forced currency
could restore public prosperity. Forced currency has been
re-imposed, and is now in full bloom, and its results are
before us . I therefore hope that no one will now ven
ture to say that he who contemplates the abolition of forced
currency is acting with levity.
amount.
The forced currency has now attained a point which Its total
was not reached before. When its abolition was thus
decided, the circulation of paper money had never sur
passed the sum of 109,500,000 drachmæ. The bank notes
now in circulation amount to 128 millions ; but when all the
paper which the Government is by law empowered to dis
pose of for supplying its needs is put in circulation it will
reach the sum of 144 millions . This is certainly a higher
figure than the 109 millions above referred to, but not so
much higher as it would appear ; for it includes the paper
circulation in the new provinces, which was formerly not
included ; it includes, also , the amount for fractional notes
issued for a sum of 18 millions drachmæ. If we exclude
these two items, we come nearer the former total of forced
currency. I make a deduction of these 18 millions, not
because I think that they do not also weigh upon the
money market, but because, in comparing the two situa
tions, I am bound to draw your attention to this difference ;
fractional notes press upon the great mass of the com
munity in a less degree than large notes, and their pressure
comes to be felt when they exceed the amount of the
fractional circulation required by the country. Be that as
it may, forced currency with us has now reached a point,
beyond which it is impossible to go, and in face of which
it is absolutely necessary to take forthwith remedial
measures .

circumstances attending these loans, so that you may have
a summary of the position of the floating and provisional
debt, namely, that of the forced currency, as distinguished
from the redeemable (sinking- fund) debt, to which latter
additions have been made only by the conversion into
redeemable of part of the provisional debt.
At the beginning of the year 1885 the floating debt
amounted to 66,400,000 drachmæ ; to this sum there have
been added 86,800,000 drachmæ, which is the amount
the forced currency loan has now reached, or will soon
reach. We have, further, 18,000,000 of fractional paper
already disposed or to be disposed of, and we have yet the
19,000,000 of specie loan voted by the Chamber during
this Session, which loan, in the form of forced currency,
represents a larger amount ; but I reckon it at 19,000,000
only, its value in specie. We have also the following pro
visional loans contracted during the years 1885 and 1886 ,
namely : With the Bank of Constantinople, 6,000,000 ;
with the National Bank, 1,530,000 ; with the Epiro
Thessalian Bank, 1,500,000 ; with the Bank of Con
stantinople, 875,000 -in
875,000 in all 9,875,000, borrowed on
collateral security of bond of the ( 1884) loan of
170,000,000 . But of these loans there have been repaid
during the same period 1,500,000 to a French bank, and
752,000 to the Epiro-Thessalian Bank. Consequently
there remain 7,622,000 drachmæ added to the floating
debt during the years 1885 and 1886. Thus the pro
visional or non-regulated debt- that which has not been
converted into a consolidated or a redeemable loan , and
which in the beginning of the year 1882 amounted to
66,400,000- has now increased to 200,022,500.
This
debt
of
200
millions

to
undergo
certain
changes
by
reason
of
the
agreements
entered
into
between
the
Government
and
the
parties

made

As
I
have
already

,
these

We

to

some
of
the

bought

for

purpose

to

thus

those
who

of

forming

portion
of
the
loan
of
19,000,000
sanctioned
by
the
law
of
31st
May
,
1886
.
Thus
the
debt

,
formerly
amounting
to
47,343,000
,
is
reduced
to
28,043,000
,

for

By this combination , 33,700 bonds of the ( 1884 ) loan of Reduction of
170 millions are redeemed from pledge ; and these bonds, floating debt.
together with the 7,611 not yet disposed of, can be sold by
the Government against specie for the payment of the
coupons next due, a corresponding amount of the forced cur
rency loan being at the same time cancelled. The amounts
thus deducted from the provisional debt, being added to
another loan of 18,000,000 (the loan for the construction of
roads, of which I make mention simply for the sake of
order) about to be converted into a redeemable loan,
produce the sum of 34,800,000, which are thus deducted
from the category of floating debts, and are transferred to
the province of redeemable loans. By these means the

floating debt, including the forced currency loan , is
limited to 165,000,000. As regards the portion of this
floating debt which accrues from advances made on the
security of bonds of the loan (1884) of 170,000,000, we
have before us, as I have already stated, ample time for
consideration . But as regards the portion accruing from
the forced currency loan, we are not pressed for repayment,
it is true, but we are pressed by the burden of the forced
currency itself, and must take remedial measures as soon
as possible.
Such is the position of the liabilities of the Public
Treasury at this moment, when we are considering what
measures should be taken by forethought with regard to
the future of our finances. These liabilities are payable in
specie ; we are therefore bound to provide specie for what
is required for their service ; we are also bound to make
provision for some financial combination with regard to
the capital, for the re-payment of which we can extend
our efforts through the whole of the ensuing year. Such
a financial combination, however, is inseparably connected
with measures for the liquidation or the reduction of the
forced currency loan ; because, in the present state of the
forced currency, the re-establishment of financial rela
tions on a normal footing becomes very difficult indeed .
But by what means can we succeed in improving the
condition of social money matters, which has become so
critical by reason of the excessive amount of the forced
currency. Several measures have been proposed ; many
have enquired into the causes of the evil and have devised
special means for dealing with a difficulty which they
consider as resulting from abuses practised by individual
combinations, organised with a view to speculative action
independent of, and having no relation with, the existence
of forced currency. The Government have been urged
from many quarters to save the public by adopting
stringent measures against stock exchange gambling, on
the supposition that such measures, which ought always


15
to be taken for the sake of moral considerations, could
bring about an improvement of the present situation . The
evil, however, has its root in forced currency and in the
excessive amount of bank-notes lent to the Government
and already in circulation ; and as long as we do not take
remedial measures with regard to this, it is vain to hope that
by inflicting punishments on speculators we shall bring
about a change for the better.
By what means, therefore, can we limit the amount of Honest
notes in circulation at a time when we are unable, in the finance.
open market, to effect a loan for even 100,000 drachmæ in
specie ? The only way is to prove that we are determined
to live like honest men, by fulfilling our obligation ; that
if we borrow, we do so after considering our ability to pay
the amount required for the service of what we borrow,
and that the loans which we may effect for the conversion
of the paper loans into specie, will have the amounts
required for their service covered by the revenue in the
Budget. When capitalists see that there is an equilibrium
in our Budget, that this Budget, being balanced, includes
also the amounts required for the service of the loans, by
means of which the conversion of paper loans into specie
loans is to be effected, there will be no difficulty to con
tract such loans.
Now, see what has been achieved by honesty in the Its
matter of these provisional loans. Some time previously advantages.
rumours were circulated in the Chamber that it was im
possible to re-establish the finances of the country without
partial bankruptcy : that it was impossible to meet the
demands made upon the Public Treasury without cur
tailing the payments due to our creditors. Ill-timed
debates in the Chamber as to the right of the State to tax
the bondholders of existing loans : untimely discussions
carried on in the press as to bankruptcy being the only
issue left for Greece out of her difficulties-had so severely
shaken the confidence of capitalists abroad that it was
impossible to approach them, whether for permanent

If the Chamber, takes this view of the necessities which
the Chamber. impose upon it the duty of voting the Budget on premises
quite different from those which have prevailed up to the
present time, it will surely be prepared to proceed to the
consideration of the measure which we now submit to it.
The Chamber cannot think differently when it considers
the interests of the State, and when it examines the
special question with which I have just dealt— the question
of the forced currency- which is both of social and of fiscal
importance. The Chamber cannot deliberate in any other


17
sense, it cannot do otherwise than vote the Budget
showing an equilibrium. But should the Chamber decline
to vote this Budget, should the Chamber decline to place
the nation under the obligations which the voting of such
a Budget entails, should the Chamber repel taxation, the
necessity for fresh taxes will impose itself ; with this
difference — that should the Chamber decide to vote a
Budget showing an equilibrium , the taxes will be voted by
the Chamber itself ; but should such a Budget not be voted.
then the taxes will be imposed by the pressure of actual facts .
indispensable.
The means which forced currency afforded us have now Additional
been exhausted, the last note having been put into circu- taxation
lation ; our credit is no less exhausted, and at the present
moment we cannot procure even a hundred thousand
drachmæ, neither through forced currency nor in the open
market. On former occasions both the Chamber and the
nation at large have deliberated on taxation and on the
means of bringing about an equilibrium ; but they were
never pressed by the emergency which the Chamber and
the people find themselves in at the present moment. They
therefore could then afford, in a certain measure, to be mis
taken as unfortunately they were mistaken - without sub
mitting to the consequences which such an error would now
entail. If they then thought that they could re-establish an
equilibrium in the Budget without having recourse to
additional taxation, nay, even by the abolition of certain
taxes ; if they then thought that they could effect in the
Budget economies to the extent of 10 or 15 millions,
whereas facts have proved that those fiscal reforms have
ultimately led to an increase ofthe deficit and the swelling
of the expenditure ; if the outcome of such error, was,
during one year, as in the year 1885, a deficit of 26,000,000 ;
yet the result could not then be immediate ruin, because
the Government could still cover the deficit by means of
foreign loans, whether consolidated , or redeemable, or
provisional ; and in any case the then Government could
B


18
have recourse to the means of supply created by the past,
it could have recourse to forced currency, which other
men had abolished, and by the abolition of which they had
created for the State a reserve fund of 85,000,000 -a basis
upon which the nation could fall back, when its Govern
ment erred with impunity. This basis is now gone and we
can expect nothing neither from forced currency nor from
credit. Whence then do you expect to derive means for
sufficing to your wants, if you erroneously imagine that
we can settle matters without real retrenchment in expen
diture, or without additional taxation. I have already
told you that if you now attempt to have recourse to
former experiments, without being backed as hitherto
by public credit, and without possessing the resources of the
forced currency unexhausted-if you venture upon similar
experiments in order to avoid fresh taxation , when such
taxation is imposed by actual facts, the unavoidable result
is manifest. For, as you cannot procure money to cover
the deficit by means of loans of some sort or other, those
who have to receive from the public treasury will soon
cease to be paid and thus a tax will actually be imposed
on the employés, pensioners, and creditors of the State.
Is this not real taxation-the non-payment of the civil ser
vants, the non-payment of the pensioners, the non-payment
of the holders of Government bonds ? Is this not a taxa
tion which you will impose on the Greek people, so long as
the Greek people are holders of national bonds, so long as
the Greek people are represented in its civil service ? And
do you imagine that you can escape from this circle- that
by inscribing in the Budget a deficit in lieu of taxation,
this deficit will not become taxation, or that it will not
have to be covered all the same by taxation ? It will have
to be covered ; not by those, however, on whom the
Chamber distributes equitably the weight of taxation ,
but by those who will happen to present themselves at the
public treasury when it becomes empty. Taxation is
indispensable if we wish to extricate ourselves from the

Taxation, absolutely considered, is certainly an evil. Tax-bearing
Taxation as now existing in Greece is admittedly not incon- capabilities.
siderable ; but, in order to find an issue out of abnormal
difficulties, sacrifices are necessary ; and having regard to
present circumstances, the taxation now proposed is not
a disproportionate one. At first sight one may be led to
believe that it is impossible to impose new burdens on the
people, without thereby impairing production , the reduction
of which would indirectly lessen the public revenue. Of
course, when the finances of a country reach such a point,
nothing can avail, whether taxation be imposed or
not. It was thought that Greece had reached this point,
and, for this reason, no one was disposed to approach
her, or grant to her the benefits of public credit. It has
been believed, having been bruited about by ourselves, that
Greece is unable to support more burdens, and that any
additional taxation constitutes an impost on production,
and thus reduces the revenue derived therefrom, which
is already far in excess of the amount hoped to be forth
coming from any new taxation. When such things came
to be believed, it was impossible for us to be in touch with
foreign capital, and the word bankruptcy made itself heard.
But I now call upon you to study and to inquire into

.
figures, to search with the knowledge you have of the
past, and, led by the experience you possess of the appli
cation of previous legislation, to say whether it is not
possible to make such re-adjustment of the Budget as will
enable the State to draw upon new resources, and to draw
upon them in a manner that will not impede the develop
ment of production.
In order to proceed with this inquiry, we must begin
in the Budget from the origin of the present situation, and we must
consider what the Budget would have been if we contented
ourselves with scheduling in an Appropriation Bill for the
ensuing year, the credits necessary for carrying on the
Government of the country, according to existing legisla
tion, and if we simply asked you to sanction the taxa
tion as now laid down by law. With this object in view,
we can take no other starting point than the Budget of
the year 1886. In all Budgets we find inscribed in parallel
columns, for purposes of comparison and verification , the
credits for the ensuing year and the credits for the
year elapsed. But since, unfortunately, the credits and
the estimates of our Budgets are very often considerably
distant from actual facts, we ought to have a third column
showing the results in the estimates of the previous
year. Now, as far as we are able to correct the items
inscribed in the Budget for the year 1886 (and in this we
have to be guided by its application), we arrive at
figures which can serve to establish the real situation of
our finances, and to show what the Budget would have
been for the year 1887 , if no provision were made for some
approximation between revenue and expenditure. The
Budget for the year 1886 was voted without showing a
complete equilibrium ; it showed a deficit, if not a very
important one. But the actual application of that Budget
has proved that it was quite an imaginary one. For, with
regard to revenue, facts have proved that most of the
items cannot possibly produce by the end of the year the
amounts estimated ; and, as you will see in the Budget for


21
the year 1887 , based on that for 1886, as corrected, the
column of amended results, which constitutes the Budget
for 1887 , shows n almost every item reductions in revenue.
Thus, in the land-tax we have a reduction of 1,140,000
drachmæ ; in house tax, 700,000 drachmæ ; in tax from
joint- stock companies, 200,000 drachmæ ; in wine tax,
1,240,000 drachmæ ; in customs, 2,000,000 drachmæ ; in
stamp duties, 1,425,000 drachmæ ; in sundry other dues,
510,000 drachmæ ; in playing cards, 150,000 drachmæ ; in
spirits, 250,000 drachmæ ; tobacco, 3,900,000 drachmæ ;
cigarette paper, 500,000 drachmæ ; petroleum monopoly,
400,000 drachmæ ; coinage, 300,000 drachmæ ; metals and
quarries, 110,000 drachmæ ; saltworks, 700,000 drachmæ ;
and other reductions of secondary importance, as on
sundry receipts, 214,000 drachmæ ; deductions from civil
pensions, 50,000 drachmæ, and so forth . The total of the
above amounts constitutes a reduction of 13,920,000
drachmæ. But, on the other hand, we have computed
some additions, amounting in all to 2,176,000 drachmæ ;
therefore, the reductions in the receipts of the Budget, as
verified by facts, amount to 11,743,000 drachmæ . Such
being the difference in the revenue side of the Budget, we
have also some differences in the expenditure-differences
which have also been noted in the expenditure column of
the Budget, and which serve as basis for the estimates of
1887. Thus we find that the amount required for the
service of the public debt has been estimated by 3,166,000
drachmæ less than the actual sum, because no sufficient
provision had been made against a rise in the exchange.
We equally discern that the military expenditure has been
estimated by 2,638,000 drachmæ less than the actual
amount ; but this sum has been covered by the Extra
ordinary Budget, which, being an adjunct of the normal
Budget, could provide for the deficiences thereof.

the year 1886, and this we did . In framing the Budget for


22
Circumstances
affecting Estimates.
1887 we laid down the amended items of revenue and
expenditure for 1886, and the Budget, thus amended,
presents a deficit of 22,270,000. I have already stated
that the deficit for the year 1886 would amount to
25,000,000, because some sources of revenue will most pro
bably be more productive during the year 1887 than was the
case in 1886. I think that in computing this difference at
3,000,000 we have not been extravagant in our estimates ;
and especially as far as ustoms are cconcerned this differ
ence in favour of the ensuing year will, we are confident,
be borne out by facts.
Further we did not think that we ought to found any
expectations as we ourselves have often done on the
probabilities of a good crop ; we must keep in view the
fact that the Budget of Greece differs from the Budgets
of almost all other countries in this- that it is affected most
materially by circumstances of weather and by political
events. The character of our taxation , the manner in
which the public service is carried on with us— all this
contributes to lend to special circumstances a material
influence on the results of our Budgets. If, therefore, we
frame our Estimates after the manner prevailing in other
countries, we run the risk of arriving at inaccurate results.
We cannot inscribe in our Budgets, after the introduction
of a new law, probable results similar to those computed
in other countries ; for, with us, until a new tax be, so
to say, acclimatised and bear its full result, more time
must elapse than is required in other countries. It is true
that new legislation nowhere enters into full play on the
very first year of its application ; but with us this is the
case in a greater measure. More especially, however,
circumstances of weather exercise an important influence
even upon direct taxes, since they affect our products ;
but they also tell seriously on indirect taxes by diminishing
the wealth of the country and the power of consumption.
Of this we have had bitter experience, and for this reason
we must not base our Budgets upon favourable prognosti


23
cations. We ought perhaps not to frame them even on the
basis of simple averages ; we ought rather to draw them.
up after the lowest averages.
Standard of
Estimates for
The Budget for 1887 has been framed on this principle.
We have taken into consideration, as already stated, the 1887.
Estimates of the year immediately preceding, but after
amending these Estimates on the basis of the lowest
average. It was easy to discover this standard in the
year 1886 , for during that year the Budget has worked
on the lowest possible averages, and consequently we had
a safe standard upon which to base our calculations.
These calculations have resulted in the fact that the
Budget for the year 1886, which will leave in all proba
bility a deficit of 25,000,000 , when taken as a basis for
the Budget of 1887, gives for the latter a deficit of
22,000,000 and more.
In face of this deficit we have to consider what is to be Inconve
done. As already stated, if, having thus framed our Budget, niences of unprovided we laid it before the Chamber, and declared that the deficits.
deficit must be covered by degrees, that it is not possible
to wipe it off in one year ; if we had come before the
Chamber and said this , and if the Chamber were per
suaded to vote the Budget without expenditure being
balanced by revenue, we would find ourselves, from the
very first month of its application, in an inextricable
difficulty. It would not be possible to proceed ; we
would enter into the stage of deferred payments ; the
public treasury would be besieged ; and as we know
unfortunately from previous experience - associations
would be formed for the discount of Orders upon the
Treasury, first at the rate of 10, 20, and 50 per cent., and
then on no terms whatever.
against the deficit.
Such would be the effects of passing such a Budget ; Provisions
and for this reason our first impression was that we
would have been justified in imposing a certain sacrifice
upon those who would be the first to reap the benefits of
the equilibrium in the Budget, namely, upon the civil

Promised economies not effected.
Economies
employés. Regular payments by the public treasuries
will be a decided benefit for them, accustomed, as they
unfortunately are, to meet with a very different reception
at those offices. Ready payments, therefore, constitute a
gain on which it appeared to us that it would be permissible in
case of need to levy a certain percentage against the advan
tage of establishing the equilibrium. Fortunately , however,
the further examination of the Budget has convinced us
that we could dispense with this measure, in preference of
other means whereby the equilibrium could be attained.
As regards expenditure, we were bound to consider
whether it was possible to effect reductions otherwise than
by the curtailment of the already inadequate salaries of
public servants.
We had before us the results of the past ; we had before
us the Budgets for the years 1885 and 1886 , framed on
promises of the utmost economy. Had it appeared to us
that those promises were fulfilled, we might have had some
reason to persuade ourselves that it was not possible for
us to do anything further ; since the Budgets for the years
1885 and 1886 would have effected everything promised
by those who had framed those Budgets. But in this
Chamber we must act in the light of truth, and we must
all acknowledge, whatever be our interest to hide truth,
that the Budgets for the years 1886 and 1885 have no more
effected economies than those immediately preceding them.
We had consequently to deal with the question whether
it is possible to introduce some economy in the Budget
for the year 1887 ; for the repetition of illusory economies
could not contribute to the effectual re- establishment of
an equilibrium.
We have, therefore, proceeded to draw up the Budgets
now effected. of the civil departments, earnestly seeking by what means
we could reduce expenditure . Most of these Budgets have
been drawn up with results similar, or little differing from,
those of the Budgets for the years 1886 and 1885. Yet, it
appeared to us that, since it was not possible to obtain


25
from the civil departments any material reduction of ex
penditure, on the basis ofthe existing system, we were bound
to consider whether some economies could not be effected
by means of reorganisation . Consequently we have intro
duced in the Ministry of the Interior certain measures of
reorganisation which have resulted in retrenchment. In
framing the Budget of this department we have proceeded
to abolish the Eparchies ( Sub-prefectures)--a measure
which results in a considerable saving, but which, at the
same time, entails some increase in the expenses of the
Nomarchies (Prefectures). The reduction amounts to
423,720, and the increase to 100,000 drachmæ, and there
fore there is a saving of 323,000 drachmæ. We have
proceeded to amalgamate the postal and telegraph ser
vices, from which measure we obtain a saving of 250,000
drachmæ. We have also taken certain other measures of
secondary importance. The customs steam-cruisers have
been transferred to the Ministry of Marine , which can use
them as originally intended, without therefore adding to
the Estimates a charge equal to that hitherto inserted in
the Budget of the finance department. It is even pro
bable that during the year 1887 there will be no additional
expenditure on this head. We have, besides, incorporated
the telegraph guards with the gendarmerie, without how
ever increasing the strength of the last-named body, and
have thus done away with the appointment of telegraph
guards by recommendation, a practice which impaired
essentially this service. All these measures have produced
an amount which in itself is certainly of no sufficient
importance as affecting the deficit, but which, as an
element of the general effort in that direction, is of some
weight.

but with reductions consequent upon the reorganisations
above stated, there remained for us to inquire into the
expenditure of the military departments. On former

occasions also have I spoken of these departments in the
Chamber, and in all sincerity I stated that if any one was
anxious to effect economies, he might seek them in the
Ministry for War, but not in our marine department ; for
this last-named Ministry is most niggardly provided for in
the Budget. It is in the Ministry for War that one might
find scope for economies, if Greece were minded to change
her policy. And even then this would be open to doubt.
It appears to me, however, that late events, both at home
and abroad, render it useless to inquire whether Greece
meditates a change of policy. This policy, the immediate
consequence of which is the heavy Budget of the war
department, will continue ; consequently we have to con
sider whether we can curtail our military expenditure
while continuing that policy. With regard to the war
department, we had furthermore to consider whether,
after trying for a few years our present military system,
after mobilising more than once, after obtaining satis
factory results from that system-whether it had not
become necessary to revise it thoroughly, not with a view
of rendering it weaker for the sake of economy, but for
the purpose of increasing its strength, while, at the same
time, we secured certain economies.
A vital question in the formation of an army is that of
the length of service. Service in the army constitutes the
heaviest of the taxes paid by the Greek people ; but since
this tax is inseparately connected with our national aspira
tions, much less is thought of this burden than of other
taxes less important ; and nothing brings greater honour
to the Greek people than the importance they attach to
this obligation of serving in the Army. Calculate this
obligation in money ; do not take into account the tax paid
in blood ; reckon its value simply in money, and you will
perceive to what a great burden it corresponds. But this
tax is the primary element of our national action ; and for
this very reason, while it is not permitted to us to impose
an atom more of it than is absolutely necessary, we must


27
be equally careful not to demand it in any lesser degree
than is imperatively needed . In order to regulate this
tax-in order to regulate the length of the service, accord
ing to what is absolutely necessary, it was divided into
two categories, and we thus have in the Army two kinds
of military service-one of longer and one of shorter
duration. But this division has been the source of some
evil. The service limited to one year in the infantry was
fraught with good results for the country at large, the
success of the law of recruitment being due to this yearly
service. If this law had been applied as originally intro
duced, i.e., exacting a service of three years, limited to
two years in the infantry-it would not have worked, since
it imposed simultaneously on the nation the new system of
compulsory military service together with the abolition of
substitution. The enforcement of so important an inno
vation and its successful working was rendered possible.
only by limiting the length of service to one year ; and
this law has worked so satisfactorily, that we have already
reached that stage at which trained men from the reserve
corps enter into the national guard. The reserve corps is
now fully constituted, and is composed of men who have
all passed through the ranks . Our reserve force being
thus constituted, it answers to the first requirement of the
Greek Army, and this to such a degree that the present
organisation of the cadres is not proportionate to the
number of available men ; we have well trained men of
the reserve force, for whom we have not a sufficient
number of cadres. However largely our cadres may be
increased, by virtue of Bills relating to reserve cadres
which we propose submitting to the Chamber during the
present Session, they will still fail to provide for all the
trained men whom we have now in our reserves.

numerical strength. The distinction between the longer
and the shorter service needs revision quite as much as
the Decree, in virtue of which the men enrolled for one
year's service are called upon to join the ranks at two
different epochs of the year, this class of men being
divided for this purpose into two portions. This division
is an inevitable consequence of the short service system,
the result of which, however, is that the cadres, being
continually occupied in training men in the inferior stages
of drill, cannot give sufficient attention to the more
important manoeuvres. A simultaneous enlistment of the
entire class would enable the officers, not to occupy most
of their time in such training, but to apply themselves to
the more general applications of drill. For this reason we,
who at a former time proposed and obtained the sanction
ing of the one year service, being now convinced that the
Army will be strengthened by some amendment of that
law, and being persuaded that, by a suitable legislative
combination, we can effect such an amendment without
overburdening the people, but on the contrary, with the
concession of certain advantages which counterbalance
the extension of service- we have not hesitated to pro
pose to you to equalize the length of service in the
infantry with the time of service now fixed for the technical
corps (two years), circumscribing it, however, by the
several conditions enunciated in the Bill.
Advantages of The principal limitation of the two years' service, which
the two years' is the corner-stone of the new law of recruitment, is
founded on this idea, which we find prevailing in other
countries where economy is deemed of the highest import
ance in the formation of the Army-on the idea, namely,
that the men ought not be retained in the ranks in great
numbers during the season of the year when they cannot
be trained with advantage. As the men are now retained
in the ranks during the summer months, they cannot be
employed in drill owing to the rigour of the climate.
Consequently, according to the scheme now proposed, on


29
the conclusion of the spring exercises all those serving
their second year will be set free, although they will be
enrolled only in the month of October. Thus a deduction of
four months will be made from the two years' obligation,
while, during the first year, all men in succession will be
allowed one month's leave of absence. As regards the
technical corps, the length of service of which is thus
lessened, their efficiency is not impaired by this reduction
when considered in conjunction with the equalization of the
now existing two systems of service ; for, on the one
hand, the reduction of the time of service, of which I have
spoken, coincides with the season during which drill either
ceases or becomes very slack ; but, besides, there is
another counterbalancing advantage in this equalization
of service, namely, that it admits of enrolment by selection
in the technical arms ; it admits of the enrolment in the
cavalry, not of those who have chanced to draw for ser
vice, but of trained horsemen, and in the engineers ' corps
not merely of two years' service men, but of those who
have been mechanics all their lives. The experience
which a trained horseman brings with him on entering the
cavalry is worth more than the time which, according to
the proposed system, is deducted from the two years' ser
vice, when this system is applied also to the cavalry. A
recruit familiar with the management of the horse may be
considered as having already served one or two years,
and the same may be said, as regards the engineers ' corps
of smiths and carpenters , and of those who are trained
in trades answering to the requirements of the arm into
which they are enrolled. By this means the equalisation
of service will be obtained with advantage to the Army,
and with an equal benefit to those who were formerly
enlisted on the two years' system. We lay some burden
upon the men hitherto enrolled for one year, but this
burden is counterbalanced by the reduction of the dura
tion of service during the summer months, and also by
another consideration . The reserve force has now become

so numerous that the execution of the law relating to
reserves becomes impracticable. By this law every man
belonging to the reserve must be called out for drill every
second year. We find it impossible to drill once in two
years 120,000 men , or 60,000 men each year, in addition
to the standing Army ; and for this reason, we have
adopted a system in force with other nations, in virtue of
which the reserves are called out for service only twice
during the time of their liability, and are thereby relieved
of this obligation on two other periods. These advan
tages constitute the counterpoise to the extension of the
one year service now in force ; and this, combined with the
reduction of the service of men enrolled in the technical
corps of the Army-the cavalry excepted-produces, in
all, a national burden equal to that sustained now by the
division of the service into two categories.

the

demands
a

which

But in order to enable ourselves to do away with volun
teers in the Army, we were obliged to revise the organisa


31
tion of our gendarmerie especially, and of our light
infantry (Evzones) . At present about half of the Evzone
regiments are formed of men liable to obligatory service ,
who avoid enrolment in the infantry by voluntary enlist
ment for two years with the Evzones. These men are in
military merit equal to the volunteers— such is the opinion
of competent judges . The great burden which the State
assumes by the addition of volunteers to the yearly con
scription had already been noticed ; and , therefore , the Army
Organisation Act had made enrolment with the Evzones
permissible to those who voluntarily presented themselves
prior to their time of drawing, but on condition of a
two years' service. These voluntary enlistments reduced
by an equal number the men of that year's class who were
enrolled by drawing ; and the public treasury effected an
economy from the pay and rations of as many men.
Furthermore, by means of such enlistments, the number of
men in the Evzones, who did not belong to the classes of
obligatory service, was reduced by about one - half. But
this was not sufficient to circumscribe profuseness in expen
diture . And since it has hitherto been proved that men
under full twenty-one years of age satisfy the require
ments of this particular arm, these requirements will
now be satisfied more readily by men of the age of twenty
two (which is the drawing age) . This will be the more
so since the equalisation of the length of service renders
selection possible. In future, therefore, we shall enrol in the
Evzones men who, from their previous life, are better
adapted to this arm ; and thus selection, which by the pre
sent system could not be obtained otherwise than by volun
tary enlistment, will be secured through the new law, by
means of the opportunity which the equalisation of the
length of service of all the men of one class affords to the
authorities. The Evzone regiments being in future re
cruited in this manner, will be assimilated to the infantry
also as regards pay ; and this again results in a considerable saving.


32
The
Gendarmeric
.
As regards the Gendarmerie, we have also admitted
that the formation of this corps by means of volunteers
constitutes a charge on the Treasury, disproportionate to
the means of the country. If the Gendarmerie was formed
with us as is the case in other countries, where it
constitutes a much smaller proportion to the rest of the
Army-of men who served for many years in the Army,
and were distinguished for good conduct and zeal in the
service, the substitution of volunteers by men belonging to
the obligatory service, would not have impaired the
efficiency of the gendarmerie. But to recruit the gen
darmerie by the voluntary enrolment of men who have
served in the Army for a short space of time, or not at all,
presents no advantage ; and the voluntary enrolment of such
men, who remain for a prolonged time in the ranks of the
Gendarmerie, results in the lowering of the morale of that
body—a fact vouched for by the public conscience of the
nation. It has been noticed that when military action is
required for the maintenance of order, the public usually
demands the presence of infantry or of Evzones in pre
ference to the Gendarmerie. This very thing—which, by
common consent, is now demanded, and which the public
service is compelled to comply with and to admit—that the
results of the employment of infantry on constabulary duty,
although injurious to the military organisation of these
bodies, is nevertheless beneficial to public order— it is
this we would endeavour to regulate effectually ; so that,
instead of sending infantry detachments on constabulary
duty, we may organise a force from the same elements as
those which go to form the infantry, enrolled for an equal
duration of service, but belonging exclusively to the Gen
darmerie. According to this new organisation , which will
be submitted to you, those who are destined to join the
Gendarmerie will be retained in the ranks and drilled as
soldiers during the first eight out of the nineteen months
which constitute obligatory service in the army ; and upon
their acquiring their complete training, they shall be trans


33
ferred to the Gendarmerie, in which they shall serve for
one year. This measure is chiefly dictated by considera
tions of economy ; but it is no less recommended to us by
the very facts we have to deal with. The reorganisation
of the Gendarmerie is now demanded by the country ; and,
having regard to the proportion, such as it exists with us,
of the Gendarmerie to the Regular Army, the basis of such
a reorganisation can be no other than the one I have just
expounded.
In addition to these economies, the equalisation of the
length of service causes an important saving in the
clothing of the infantry. At present a complete outfit is
given to each man for the one year ; while in the case of
enrolments for a longer service, the second year will not
require the same, outlay for clothing as the first year. This
expense will, for the second year, be about one-fourth of
that required for the first year.

The economies thus effected by the reduction in the Economies in

reduction in the cost of clothing, will cause a saving on
the Budget of the Ministry of War. These same economies
will cause a reduction in the Budget of the marine depart
ment also. Because, the same necessity which we found
existing in regard to the land forces, exists also in our
Navy. It is even more apparent in the Navy. When the
one year service was introduced into the land force, it was
not simultaneously applied to the Navy, it having been
deemed impossible to render useful as sailors men who
enlisted for one year only. Other considerations, however,
have since prevailed, and a law on naval recruitment was
voted, whereby service in the Navy was limited to one
year. In reorganising our Navy we have found it abso
lutely necessary to extend the duration of the service ; but
such an extension of naval service would have been most
difficult-the reduction having once been voted- were not
the same measure taken simultaneously with regard to the
land forces. The resolution arrived at for the extension of
с


34

Strength of Cadres.
service in the Army facilitates the solution of the same
question as regards the Navy ; and consequently the
recruitment for both services will now be regulated con
jointly. The recruitment for the Navy will include chiefly seafaring men ; but as this class is insufficient there will
be selected from the class of each year those inhabitants
of the coast lands who are accustomed to the sea, and
thus we shall succeed in recruiting for the Navy the neces
sary number of men, in so far as that number is not made up
purely of seafarers. By these means, while the crews are
kept up to their full strength, a considerable saving is at the
same time effected ; for the difference between the stipend
of those who voluntarily enrol and of those who serve as
conscripts is, in the Navy, even greater than in the land
forces. We have, therefore, effected important economies
in our Navy also, but these we cannot precisely fix. Greece
being a naval power, will, in case of action, rely as much
at least on her Navy as on her Army. Consequently it
is difficult to effect definite economies in the naval force ;
because the increase in the number of men swallows the
benefit derived from the reduction in pay.
From the Budget of the Ministry of Marine another im
portant credit is deducted-that for light-houses, the
administration of the light-houses having been organised
on a different footing. They will still be administered by the
Ministry, but they are to have a separate fund accruing
from special resources now created by law. All these items ,
although they may appear in the Budget of the Ministry of
Marine as making up a considerable saving, do not actually
result in any reduction as regards the general Budget ; for,
the light-houses system, which of course must continue to
exist, will not only be completed, but will have to be
maintained in a more efficient manner than heretofore ,
and the expense for these purposes is recorded elsewhere
in the Budget.
Thus the organisation of our forces has been framed
upon a new basis of recruitment-the law of recruitment


35
being the cornerstone of every army organisation scheme.
Further economies are effected in details independent of
the question of recruitment, it is true, but indirectly relating
to it, as we shall presently see. In the new organisation
of the army, the regimental and battalion cadres have been
retained as they now exist. Their strength is undoubtedly
much in excess of any proportion when compared with the
Army on peace footing of a State having a population of
two million souls. The reduction, however, of these cadres
is inadmissable, because it is impossible to meet the re
quirements of mobilisation by means of reserve cadres.
Therefore, in framing our reorganization scheme, we sought
some means whereby to retain intact in time of peace the
battalion and regimental cadres, without encumbering
the Budget with the expense for men sufficient to fill up the
ranks of all the battalions, and without burdening the
country with the additional recruitment of so large a
number of men. This object has been attained by the
incorporation, for drilling purposes, of two battalions in
each regiment.
The result of these reforms upon the Budget, as it would
have stood had the present Army organisation been applied,
would have produced an economy of two and a-half millions.
Besides these retrenchments, we have effected other Calling out of
economies in the Budget of the ensuing year, which will reserves .
not appear in the Budgets of the years immediately fol
lowing. The first of these economies consists in the
omission of the sum required for the general exercises of
the reserves. The Army organisation law now in force
does not permit of such a credit being recorded in the
Budget, nor will it be allowed by the law substituting the
actual one. The law, as it now stands, permits the calling
out of all the reserves once in two years ; but the reserves
have been set free from their duties only in July last ; and
all reservists who otherwise would have been called out
now, served on that occasion . Therefore it is only in
the year 1888 we shall have power to call out again the

reserves for manoeuvres, and consequently no call can take
place during the year 1887. Only general exercises of the
active Army will then take place, and for these no extra
ordinary expenditure will be required . This expenditure
would have amounted to 800,000 drachmæ.
As regards stores, although in principle no military
requisite may be consumed in time of peace which is not
previously replaced, yet there are certain stores, with
regard to which this principle cannot be applied this year.
It cannot be applied with regard to such descriptions of
clothing as are superfluous. The preservation of stored
clothing is a matter of much difficulty in this climate, and
the preservation of a large quantity of clothing, blankets,
and other such stores would be in reality certain loss. In
a similar manner with regard to remounts, one-seventh or
one-eighth of the regulation number of horses and mules
ought to be purchased each year ; but for the present year
we need not inscribe a credit for this purpose, since the
number of animals is already in excess .
These items taken together, produce an additional saving
of one and a-half million for the year 1887 ; and therefore
there is a total saving of 4,000,000 on the Budget ofthe
Ministry of War. Thus the savings accruing from re
organisation in the Ministry of the Interior amount to
600,000 drachmæ, while those from the reorganisation of
the military services come up to 4,000,000. But we have
still another item in the reduction of expenditure.
On a former occasion, when introducing the Budget to
the Chamber, I stated that, as it occurs with other States
having a public debt, so can we also effect economies by
the conversion of loans, the market price of which exceeds
their nominal value . In such cases the State has the right
to offer to the holders of bonds of such loans the entire
capital, or to propose to them, should they not consent to
accept the capital in liquidation of the debt, to submit to
such terms as the State might consider equitable for the con
tinuance of such loans. At the time I made these remarks

the

are

partial
the suspension of the sinking fund as an alternative of the
liquidation of the debt. And this alternative we hope
they will accept, inasmuch as the application of a sinking
fund, in case of loans the market price of which is above
par, entails a loss to the holders. The majority of such
bondholders would consider the suspension of the sinking
fund as an advantage ; for shortly after such a suspension
these loans will rise considerably in the market, as was
the case formerly ; and in such case a bond which may be
paid off constitutes a loss to the holder. Consequently,
what we now propose is a clear advantage to him.

public treasury which, according to the statutory law
of the loan for 25,000,000, has been improperly introduced.
This loan was subscribed for both in Greece and abroad,
and as at that time forced currency did not exist, the right
was conceded to subscribers abroad to receive the pay
ment of the interest and of the sinking fund abroad. But
at present, when owing to the forced currency the differ
ence in the price of gold is so considerable, holders of
bonds residing in this country send their holdings abroad,
in order that they may receive there in specie the interest
and the sinking fund, after each drawing takes place.
A large business is done in this manner, the brokers
purchasing from the holders the bonds drawn and
the coupons and sending them abroad, that they may be
paid there at a premium of 25 or 30 per cent. To this
improper practice an end is to be put by the conversion
now proposed, and which consists in renewing, instead of
paying off, the bonds of such holders as may agree to the
cessation of the sinking fund, and abandon all claims to
the prevailing practice of payment being made abroad.
Those who decline to accept these two conditions will
receive the nominal amount in liquidation of their bonds.
This mode is the usual one for the conversion of loans,
and is everywhere considered , not only equitable, but in a
manner obligatory upon the State for the protection of
the interests of the taxpayer. Where it is possible to
reduce the burdens of the Budget by means of such con
version, a Government cannot act otherwise ; nor is it
permissible to a Government to derive from taxation the
sums which can be saved by such a combination . This
system , in which we propose to deal with the 25 millions
loan, we propose to apply also to the loans of four millions
and of six millions, but only in so far as the sinking fund
is concerned ; for the improper practice of forced payments
abroad does not prevail in regard to those two loans.
We also propose and ask for leave to put a stop to the
sinking fund added to the loan advanced on condition ofthe

tion. When that Bill was under discussion in the Chamber,
I represented to the Chamber, first, that it was not absolutely
necessary to put into execution the measure of the circu
lation of fractional notes by means of a loan ; but that if
the Government of the day was disposed to prefer this
form, which had also certain advantages, there was no
reason for including in the terms of the loan the payment
of a yearly sinking fund. According to the law, the
amount of sinking fund due this year is 300,000 drachmæ ;
next year, 1887 , for which we are now providing, the
sinking fund due will be 400,000, the following year
500,000, and so on till the sinking fund reaches 900,000
per annum. Now, we should either have forced currency in
full force, as at present, and in that case the amount of
these fractional notes - having been once considered
necessary- continues to be required, or we abolish forced
currency altogether, or we limit it and take measures
ourselves for the gradual reduction of the amount. But
while neither forced currency is abolished, as at present, nor
the amount of the loan contracted in connection with
forced currency is diminished, the State is compelled to
pay yearly out of credits in the Budget 400 or 500 or 900
thousand drachmæ ; and this I consider to be incapable of
any justification. By the means I have thus expounded
a saving of 2,461,000 drachmæ is effected on these three
loans. Such are the amounts which we can obtain by
retrenchment in the expenditure.
There remains now to examine to what extent we can New tax on
add to the revenue of the Budget, so as to obtain, not tobacco.
only an approximate, but an actual equilibrium between
revenue and expenditure. As regards taxation, the first
taxes to which we are compelled to turn our attention are
those very taxes which have lately been abolished . We
had then in full force the tax on tobacco, as well as the
tax on cigarette-paper undiminished. From these taxes,


40
weighing upon the people comparatively less than any
other tax, we derived a reliable revenue, which was
regularly on the increase. When the abolition of the
tobacco tax was decreed, this tax had yielded during a
whole half year more than 80,000 drachmæ per month ; it
had even advanced to 85,000 drachmæ, and a steady in
crease of this source of revenue was assured , had the
Chamber voted the Bill which provided for the prevention
of the abuses observed in the application of the statute, and
which had special reference to the control of tobacco in
uncut leaves. It is not my intention to speak of the
results which we were entitled to expect from the steady
increase of this revenue, nor of the results expected from
the voting and the application of that Bill. I speak only
of the actual outcome of this tax as it had been ascer
tained during the space of six months. There was a
yearly consumption of tobacco of one million of okas
(2,830,000 lbs. ) If we now impose, in proportion to the
increased requirements of the State, a tax of four drachmæ ,
the revenue from the consumption of one million okas will
amount to four million drachmæ, assured and nett ;
because the expenses of cutting and packing are covered
by the 50 centimes charged for cutting and by the dues
for packing, which the bands yield. The charge for
cutting and the band dues -the latter being about 30
centimes per oka-amount together to 80 centimes per
oka ; say to 800,000 drachmæ on one million okas. The
expenses which figure in the Budget for this business of
cutting and packing - which, irrespective of the expenses
of collecting the tax, is the only outlay necessitated by
this system-these expenses amount to 700,000 drachmæ,
and they are, therefore, completely covered by the dues
imposed, leaving also a surplus. Consequently the nett
revenue from the tobacco tax will reach 4,000,000 . Instead
of this, we have the tax now in force, which, according
to the tabulated statement I submit along with the
Budget, brings in 1,100,000 at the most, inclusive of ex


41
penses amounting to 100,000. These being deducted,
leave a nett revenue of one million drachmæ. If, there
fore, we revert to the first system of taxation, the increase
in revenue will amount to three millions drachmæ.
Along with this proposal I lay before you a Bill, in
virtue of which those who bring tobacco to be cut in the
Public Factory are bound to purchase at the same time
the quantity of cigarette paper necessary for each oka of
tobacco, that is twelve books, or 1,200 leaflets for every oka.
These, taken compulsorily at the Tobacco Factories, when
calculated on an ascertained cutting of 1,000,000 okas of
tobacco, will yield to the State 2,400,000 drachmæ. It is
probable that after disposing of so large a quantity at the
Tobacco Factories, there will be no sale to speak of out
side the factories, nor do I reckon upon such a sale. But
basing our calculations of the revenue from cigarette
paper on the quantity so disposed, and deducting the
sum of 500,000, produced by the system now in force, we
obtain from this tax an additional revenue of 1,900,000,
by reimposing this tax on the former scale of 20 cen
times per book of one hundred leaflets, and 10 centimes.

We propose yet another tax connected with revenue Professional
from tobacco. We have considered that those who retail licences.
tobacco ought to be subjected to a professional licence tax
higher than that which they pay at present- not to an
exceptionally high one, but compatible with the limita
tions of classes and categories as defined by statute. We
have considered that those who retail tobacco, as well as
those who retail wine and spirituous liquors, should be
subjected to a special professional tax, substituting or sup
plementing the tax on the consumption. For this purpose we have classed all retail vendors of tobacco or wine
and liquors in the higher category of traders. We have also
modified the professional licence tax, having added another
class where the population is above 20,000. At present the
classes of this tax progress per population up to 20,000 ;

With regard to the tax on wine, as with regard to other
laws voted during the last Session, we adhere to the prin
ciple that it is not advisable, in the present circumstances ,
to meddle with existing legislation, even if it does not
work satisfactorily, unless we are certain of the success of
the proposed modifications . As to the tax on tobacco and
cigarette paper we have this certainty ; but with regard
to the tax on wine, the stamp duties, the building tax, and
especially those taxes on which the progressive system has
been disingenuously applied, we must not have recourse
to innovations at present. At a time when we impose
new and heavy burdens of taxation, we should not disturb
the legislation now in force ; we must wait, before we pro
ceed to experiments , and see how existing legislation will
work after the imposition of these new burdens . Conse
quently, as regards the wine tax, we do not propose to
substitute a new law, but we propose to equalise the
percentages of the tax ; for, as it now stands, it cannot
work ; it is not based on the principles of proportionate
equality. Wine stored at Athens pays two centimes per
oka, whilst wine stored at Heraclion, for the consumption
of Athens, or at Amarousion or Chalandrion , pays half a
centime only. Such classification of taxation surely cannot
continue. Thus, although we do not propose any general
amendment of the law, we submit to your consideration
the equalisation of the percentages of the tax, hoping that
the increase in the revenue from this measure will amount
to 880,000 drachmæ, according to data fully detailed in
the tables accompanying the Budget.
But we cannot rest satisfied with these additions ; for, as
we have seen, the sum to be covered amounts to 22,000,000,
and from this we are still very far off. We have considered


43
that in the present exceptional emergency, while dealing
with a taxation the object of which is not to overburden
the people permanently, but to facilitate their issuing out
of the difficulties now surrounding us, we could advan
tageously revise the tariff of import taxes, by maintaining
the duties which were formerly increased, by restoring
such as were reduced or abolished, and by modifying
certain other duties . And as in matters of tariff legislation
-paying due regard to the public interest no less than
to fair dealing in trade-it is proper that modifications
should be enforced immediately upon their being sub
mitted to the Chamber ; else those who happen to hold
goods in bond import them before the new measure is
sanctioned, to the detriment of the State and of their com
petitors for these reasons, I submit at once for your
approval the Bill for the amendment of the customs tariff,
and I also append the tariff in question. I also submit, by
wish of my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs, a
Bill signed by him, and relating to the ratification of a
commercial treaty with France for the assimilation of the
tariffs respectively applied to goods from each country to
that applied to the most favoured nations. This Bill also
relates to some other tariff regulations of minor importance.

the duty on sugar in Italy, Russia, Holland, or France.
Even after this increase, Greece will come tenth in the
table of European States as regards the duty on sugar.
When a nation is pressed by our present requirements it
cannot hesitate to submit to a taxation which nine other
States have adopted in a still heavier degree, many of
them having no national obligations, no national aspira
tions such as those for which we would be ready to
sacrifice, not only money, but our blood also , as we have
proved on many occasions. From the increase of the
sugar duty, as far as the ascertained data go to show, we
may expect an increase of 1,255,000 in the revenue.
The increase on other duties promise an additional
revenue of 2,169,000 drachmæ, as is shown by the detailed
tables, which will be laid before the Chamber together
with this Bill. From the taxation of goods now free from
duty, we expect a revenue of 556,000 drachmæ , and these
three items added together produce the sum of 3,980,000
drachmæ. But the new tariff contains other modifications
consequent upon the application of the principle we have
followed, namely, that of increasing the duties formerly
reduced, and of voting afresh those that were abolished.
These increased or re-imposed duties are recorded in the
tariff only in conformity with the principle laid down, and
because we shall now for the first time have a distinction
between a general tariff and a treaty tariff ; else , these
duties will not contribute to the public treasury a revenue
worth mentioning, since they can only be applied as if the
present duties were included in the treaty stipulations.
The new or increased duties are, therefore, recorded
in the general tariff as applied only on goods imported
from countries which do not enjoy the advantages of the
treaty tariff.
To the amount, however, of about 4,000,000 , derived
from these tariff modifications which are not provided
against by treaty stipulations, another addition is made
by the obligation now introduced- that all import duties

we have come to the conclusion that, since, according to
the proposed system of additional taxation , everything by
law liable to taxation in the old provinces of the kingdom
will be subject to additional taxation , it would not be
equitable to exempt the Ionian Islands from such propor
tionate additional taxation . They should also be sub
jected to a taxation, which we could not estimate other
wise than in the proportion of the additional taxes which
they do not pay. For the principal taxes on which the
additional percentage is now imposed do not prevail in the Ionian Islands.

TRICOUPIS. - We have come to the conclusion that, since
the taxes in the Ionian Islands are to be collected at the


47
Customs, and since payment is now to be required in gold
or bank notes with an additional 15 per cent. , we have
come to the conclusion that payment in this form may also
be required in the matter of the export duties levied in
the Ionian Islands, and this will result in some degree in
equalisation of taxation .
Before communicating to the Chamber the total results List of Bills of these additional taxes and of others of minor import- submitted.
ance, I will submit the Budget itself and the Bills relating
thereto, which incorporate our present proposals. Together
with the Budget we also submit the Provisional Statement
of Revenue and Expenditure during the year 1885 , and
the definite accounts for the years 1884 and 1883, with
some data relating to the military service, which are
required partly by the Law of Public Accounts, and partly
for the more just appreciation of the Bills now submitted ,
and generally for the discussion of matters relating to the
Army. The Bills now submitted are the following : -
PAPAMICHALOPOULOS. - But you have not told us what
will be the total revenue and total expenditure of the
Budget.
TRICOUPIS .—I have told you that before proceeding to
this communication, I shall submit the Bills of which I
spoke. I now submit the Bill for the Customs Tariff with
the Tariff itself appended to it. These are already in
print, as also the Budget, and they will be distributed this
evening. I submit a Bill for the ratification of the Pro
visional Commercial Convention between Greece and
France ; Bills relating to the loans of the six, twenty-five,
and four millions ; a Bill relating to the loan in fractional
bank-notes of 1 and 2 drachmæ. Along with these Bills I
submit, in conjunction with my colleague the Minister of
Marine, another Bill sanctioning the Convention for the
sale of the two ships " Mykale " and " Sphacteria " to the
Hellenic Steamship Company, and defining the mode of
the disposal of the purchase money. I submit this Bill
along with the Bills relating to the regulation of loans, as


48
the proceeds from this sale and certain other revenues
recorded in the Bill are to be employed in the creation
of a fund for the acquisition of a fleet. I submit a Bill
for the taxation of land products and of cattle for the
year 1877 ; a Bill for the amendment of the law relating
to the taxing of cigarette-paper ; a Bill for the taxation of
tobacco cousumed within the kingdom ; a Bill to modify
and supplement certain dispositions of the law relating to
the taxing of wine ; a Bill to modify certain dispositions
of the law relating to professional licences. As regards
the law relating to the taxation of buildings, we do not
propose, as I have already stated, to amend that law,
although it contains dispositions about progressive taxa
tion, to which we are opposed. We reserve to ourselves
to propose such an amendment at some future time ; at
present we submit to you a Bill relating to another point.
As the original law on the tax on buildings stands at pre
sent, the registration of this tax begins at the end of each
year ; consequently, even if the registration be completed
punctually, the space of time left for the collection of the
tax is of a few months. In order that this tax may be
collected like all other taxes, it is necessary that after
registration a space of time should be allowed for collection
equal to that of other taxes. The Bill I have alluded to
relates to this amendment. I submit further a Bill to restore
force to the abolished dispositions of the law relating to the
stringent collection of public revenue, and a Bill for
establishing branch public treasuries in the sub-prefec
tures, as also for the amendment of certain dispositions of
the law relating to cashiers. I submit a Bill for a credit
to the Ministry of Marine against the Budget of 1886. The
Customs steam-cruisers being transferred to the jurisdic
tion of the Ministry of Marine, I submit a Bill to sanction
this measure . I submit a Bill for the creation of a light
house fund, and another Bill to clear the indebtedness of
public employés and pensioners for sums due in regard to
pensions.


49
I shall now state to the Chamber the sum total of Recapitula
the proposed reductions in the expenditure and additions tion of
Budget.
to the revenue. According to the Budget for 1886 the
ascertained sum total of revenue-as amended by results
already known to us cannot reach to more than
76,580,000 drachmæ. The expenditure, similarly amended ,
will amount to 98,851,000 drachmæ ; and this leaves a
deficit of 22,270,000 drachmæ.

The reductions in expenditure now proposed amount to Expenditure.
2,461,000 drachmæ accruing from the conversion of the
loan ; to 4,633,000 accruing from deductions effected in the
Army and Navy ; and to 1,178,000 accruing from other
reductions in the civil departments . But against these
reductions we have also certain augmentations. As I have
already stated, these reductions include the withdrawal
of the light-house service from the Budgets of the Minis
tries of the Interior and of Marine ; but in another part of
the Budget an amount of 300,000 drachmæ is recorded for.
the endowment of the light-house fund. Reductions are
effected in the expenditure of the Post and Telegraph Offices
by the incorporation of these services, and further reduc
tions are obtained by the abolition of eparchies (sub-prefec
tures) . But against these reductions there figures a certain
increase in expenditure amounting to 1,586,000 drachmæ.
This amount, being deducted from 8,273,000 - sum total of
the above reductions- leaves 6,686,000 as definite reduc
tion in the expenditure, which latter, amounts, as aforesaid,
to 98,891,000 drachmæ. We have, therefore, inscribed
in the Budget an estimated expenditure of 92,164,000
instead of 98,891,000.
The additions to revenue, as already set forth, consist of Receipts.

of the revision and modification of sundry laws relating
to taxation, say 12,555,000 drachmæ ; of the difference
accruing from the payment of the customs duties in
specie, say 4,170,000 . These sums give a total of 20,395,000
drachmæ,

from
this
the

we
have
a
surplus
of
4,008,000
drachmæ
.
Before we deal with this surplus we must examine in
detail whether the surplus is safe. A second question arises
whether the Chamber is willing to vote the measures
whereby a surplus is secured. The chief thing, in my
opinion, is to enquire whether we really achieve such a
result ; this being established , we may listen to protests, but
we do not expect an unfavourable vote from the Chamber.
For protests do not disturb the nation, but a vote un
favorable to these measures would lead to the ruin of the
nation. We are confident of the issue if the results we submit
be reliable. By what means have we arrived at these results ?
We have deducted from the Budget of revenue for 1886
all such estimates as have been shown to be excessive and
we have supplemented in the Budget of expenditure for
1886 all credits which have been proved insufficient. You
have seen that the estimates of the revenue have been
shown excessive by 13,920,000 drachmæ, that some items
of that revenue were under- estimated to the extent of
2,176,000 ; and that, consequently, the difference in excess
amounted to 11,748,000 drachmæ. This sum has been
deducted from the Budget for 1887 , which is submitted to
you; consequently we may rely that during that year,
when the conditions under which the revenue will be
collected are foreshadowed as more favourable than those
of the year 1886- we may rely upon the realisation of the
sums inscribed in the Budget. These sums have been for
the most part , and in relative proportion, already realised
during the current year ; why then should this not be the
case in 1887 ? The estimates will surely be realised , for
they may even be considered as already below the
probable result. The economies on the other hand, which
we have recorded in the Budget of expenditure, cannot be
doubted, nor do they relate to payments which can exceed the credits accorded.


51
taxation.
There remains the question of additional taxation. Defence of Really new taxes are not proposed. The taxes on proposed
tobacco and on cigarette-paper cannot be considered new ;
they constitute a return to the system momentarily
abolished, but now supplemented. In no particular have
we dealt with unknown issues. We propose legislation
which has worked satisfactorily, which is partially still
in force . The direct taxes again, having already yielded
well-defined amounts, will surely not produce less now,
when two additional tenth parts are superadded . If
the other taxes of which I have spoken to you have pro
duced up to the present time the amounts recorded, the
additions made on the basis of proportionate estimate of
revenue after such additions— can be safely reckoned upon ;
for these additional taxes are not such as to alter the con
ditions of production or consumption. Therefore, the
amounts recorded in the Budget are positive.
revenue.
It has often been stated, I know, that Greek Budgets Ascertained
are Budgets of amounts ascertained but never collected, and collected
and that the difference between amounts collected and
amounts ascertained is a large one in Greece . What
we are aiming at now, however, is not to ascertain
large amounts, but to collect the amounts required.
For we may register whatever amounts we please ; but
should the amounts collected fall considerably short
of the amounts needed, we have worked in vain. I
have studied the Budgets of past years, that I might
determine by the experience of the past what is the pro
bable difference on each tax separately, between amounts
ascertained and amounts collected ; and this in reference
to the Budget now submitted. From a table drawn up on
this system it becomes evident that all taxes do not result
in proportionate differences between amounts ascertained
and amounts actually collected. On some taxes the deficits
are large ; on others they are smaller ; thus the deficit from
land tax amounts to 2.67 per cent.; the pasture tax pre
sents a deficit of 31.2 per cent.; the revenue from judicial
costs returnable leaves a deficit of 51.41 per cent. I have


52
Voted and disposed of credits.
Certainty of surplus.
applied each one of these proportions to the present
Budget. I have applied the 2.67 per cent. to the estimated
sum of 8,634,000, and I find a probable deficiency of
230,541 drachmæ. I have applied the proportion of the
deficit of the pasture tax, that is the 31.2 per cent. , to the
sum of 3,600,000, and I find a probable deficiency of
263,880 ; and so forth for each tax. The general result
is that the total proportion of the deficiency on the esti
mates for 1887 amounts to 7.95 per cent.; for the year
1884 to 8.25 per cent. , and for 1883 to 9.49 per cent. This
difference proceeds from the fact that the increased taxa
tion for 1887 is chiefly in taxes upon which the proportion
of the usual deficiency is smaller. This proportion of 7.95
per cent. being applied to the total of the estimated
revenue for the year 1887, amounting to 96,975,390
drachmæ, reduces the amount which we reckon upon
collecting to 89,915,990 drachmæ.
DELIGEORGIS . -Is the proportion based on the estimated
or on the ascertained amounts ?
TRICOUPIS .— Taking the year 1884, the proportion has
been applied to the amounts ascertained. Consequently
the net result, which we can reckon upon, provided there
be no change in the circumstances of past years, is that
the revenue to be actually collected will amount to
89,915,000 drachmæ.
I have applied a similar test to the amounts of credits. I
have inquired to what extent the credits disposed of during
the past year fell short of the amounts voted , and I find
that for the year 1884 they came short by 6.68 per cent.;
in 1883 , by 7.75 ; in 1882, by 9.14 ; in 1878 , by 8.37 ; in
1877, by 8.37 ; in 1870, by 5-74 ; in 1869, by 7 ·15 ; the
general average being 7.60 per cent., which is about the
same as the above-stated average deficit in the collection
of taxes.
We may thus safely reckon upon an actual revenue of
89,915,000, and upon an actual expenditure of 85,160,000,
and, consequently upon a surplus of 4,755,000 drachmæ.
As I have already stated, this surplus will be realised if


53
the ascertained amounts of revenue be collected not under
the average- this average being moderately estimated.
It is quite possible, however, to obtain ascertained receipts
below the average ; but the surplus which revenue will
still show over expenditure will be sufficient to cover any
such a deficiency.
In order to obtain a safely-balanced Budget it is Supplementary necessary that we should inscribe in the Budget credits of credits.
an amount less than the total of the revenue ; and this not
only on other grounds, but because there figure in the
Appropriation Bill credits, the amount of which is not
expressly stated, and which does not appear in the tabular
statement of the Budget-namely, the supplementary
credits. The Appropriation Bill permits expenditure of
money during the absence of the Deputies for certain
supplementary credits specially enumerated. The Budget
should, by right, provide for all these credits in the
tabulated statement ; but such credits are not specifically
included in the total amount of expenditure communicated
to you. It is the usage in other countries to insert under a
special heading in the Budget a sum- determined in
proportion to the total amount of expenditure- against
which sum such expenditure is reckoned, as may be
sanctioned by Royal Decrees, or by special laws for sup
plementary or extraordinary credits. This is not our
practice ; but when a sufficient surplus exists the result
is the same. For the surplus stands against any possible
expenditure of this kind.
With us, however, before we are justified in considering Absolute
a Budget as reliable, an excess of revenue over expenditure necessity of
surplus. is necessary in all circumstances. For in no other State is the
unforeseen so prevalent as with us, both onaccount of imper
fections in our public service and because of the diminutive
ness of the State as compared to its national obligations.
We cannot, therefore, consider the equilibrium safe if there
be no surplus to meet the requirements which may appear
unexpectedly, whether through erroneous calculations or
through defects of the service. It is impossible for our


54
Necessity of sacrifices by taxation .
Comparative weight of taxation.
Budgets to attain to the accuracy of those of some other
countries ; for we do not possess the machinery which else
where produces such accurate estimates. Nevertheless,
a surplus such as the one presented by the Budget for
1887 ensures us against any eventuality, while it covers
also the amounts of possible, or rather of unavoidable
supplementary credits, and answers to any want not pro
vided for in the regular Budget. Only with a Budget
thus framed can we say that we have a Budget showing
an equilibrium.
In order to secure such a well-balanced Budget, we
found it necessary to reorganise many departments of the
public service, resulting in advantage to the service itself.
Both the military reorganisation and that carried out in
the Ministry of the Interior and in other departments,
show considerable savings in expenditure. Yet the addi
tional taxation to which we have been compelled to have
recourse is an evil, we admit, but an evil by means of which
we repel another and a greater evil-that of bankruptcy
and the complete disorganisation of the State. Taxation
can never be considered advantageous ; being imposed by
necessity, it can sometimes contribute to further some
interest, to develop some industry or some branch of
agriculture ; but its evil effects are always deemed to be
in excess of the benefits. No tax is considered good
they are all bad ; the more so when the taxation to which
they are superadded is supposed to be sufficient for the
usual requirements of the State.
It is an indisputable fact that we are not the most
heavily taxed nation ; and this not so much because our
taxation can be said to be light, but because other
nations are overburdened with taxation. The taxation of
production is, perhaps, light in Greece, and it must
continue to be so ; for if our production in its present
infant state were overburdened with taxes, whence could
we hope for the development of this vital element in the
prosperity of the country ? But in order that taxation of
production may continue light, we are compelled to burden


55
consumption. On the whole, however, taxation with us is
not much below the average taxation in other countries ;
but even if in its present condition it were much below
that average, after our proposals are voted it will, we
own, become burdensome, when compared with the indi
vidual wealth of our population, and especially when we
consider that the country is now being regenerated and
needs much for the development of its progressive
elements. These taxes, however, are not proposed as a
permanent burden. Should peace continue for some time,
they certainly will be reduced shortly, they will certainly
disappear, they will certainly open the way to reforms in
our taxation , which reforms will render even the taxes
hitherto prevailing more light for the people to bear.
peace.
But in order to come to this, we must have peace. If Necessity of
peace, however, be disturbed, this taxation will continue.
It will continue to exist , since it is only by means of this
taxation that we shall be enabled to meet the necessities
of the new situation . But for this very reason— that we
take into account such eventualities -we trust these
taxes will be voted by the Chamber. Even if we had in
view a permanently peaceful situation, we would still pro
pose this taxation ; for it is not possible to extricate
ourselves from the present financial difficulties without
such modifications in our taxation. If it were possible to
be assured that the country would not be called upon to
take immediate action, we would perhaps agree with
those who may gainsay and insist that it is not in the
credits for the civil departments, which are not susceptible
of reduction, that curtailment of the expenditure should
be sought, but that it is in the War Budget we should
effect such reduction as to render possible a smaller
addition to existing taxation . But who can be certain
that peace is assured ? and who can pretend that, in
case peace is disturbed, Greece will be able to face
eventualities, if she cannot show a Budget such as the one
now submitted-if the Chamber by its vote on the finances
of the country does not possess the strength of will to

we
are
not
equal
to
circumstances
;
that
we
do
not
keep
pace
with
the
times
.
It
is
during
peace
we
must
prepare
ourselves
.
Only
nations
which
submit
to
sacrifices
during
times
of
peace
are
able
to
figure
in
campaigns
and
undertake
a
successful
war
.
You
have
witnessed
of
late
years
the
events
in
France
and
in
Italy
.
Examine
the
taxation
France
imposed
upon
herself
after
her
suffer
ings
;
study
the
taxation
of
Italy
after
her
struggles
.
In
the
Budgets
of
France
and
Italy
we
are
taught
how
nations
work
when
they
have
a
mission
to
accomplish
.
After
their
struggles
they
did
not
relax
their
efforts
in
times
of
peace
;
but
during
peace
they
devoted
them
selves
to
a
persistent
preparation
for
fresh
struggles
.
Will
Greece
hesitate
to
prepare
during
peace
?
Will
you
by
your
vote
declare
that
the
Greek
nation
is
inferior
to
the
Italian
or
to
the
French
people
?
