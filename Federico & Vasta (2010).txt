Keywords: Italian trade Terms of trade Economic growth Volatility
abstract
The specialization in exporting primary products is frequently deemed harmful for longrun development, because it increases volatility of terms of trade and thus the number and frequency of macroeconomic shocks. One would expect modern economic growth to solve the problem by changing the composition of trade. This paper tests this hypothesis with a new series of Italian terms of trade from 1861 to 1939, a period which spans the first stage of the industrialization of the country. The results do not tally with the hypothesis. The change in composition improved marginally the terms of trade, but it did not help much in terms of volatility. Ó 2010 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction
In a well-known paper, Sachs and Warner (2001) argue that the abundance of natural resources is a ‘‘curse” for LDCs. Their main evidence is a negative correlation between the rate of growth and the share of export of primary products on GDP. Ding and Field (2005) and Brunnschweiler and Nulte (2008) challenge this interpretation: abundance per se is positive, and the ‘‘curse”, if any, is the specialization of exports in primary products. Their view harkens back to a very long-run intellectual tradition. In the 1950s, Prebisch and Singer (Prebisch, 1950, 1959; Singer, 1950) strongly advised exporters of primary products to change their specialization as soon as they could, because their terms of trade were bound to fall and their income to decline for the combination of stagnant productivity and falling demand for their wares. This hypothesis spawned a huge theoretical (Spraos, 1983) and empirical literature. Diakosavvas and Scandizzo (1991) list 54 works published from 1960 to 1990, and Consigliere (2009) adds 26 further references. Yet, the issue has not been convincingly settled. The results differ according to the period, the sample of countries and commodities, the price series and the statistical methods (Lederman and Maloney, 2007a,b; Razzaque et al., 2007a). Almost all these works cover the period after 1900, but the issue has an obvious historical interest. Hadass and Williamson (2003) show that terms of trade have improved in most countries from 1870 to 1913, thanks to fall in transportation costs, and argue that this trend has had (small) positive effect on growth in Core countries and (small) negative effects on the Periphery. Williamson (2008) extends the data-base further back in time and argues that improvement in terms of trade of peripheral countries had negative effects on their long-run growth. The gains from exports of primary products fostered further specialization in agriculture and mining, away from manufacturing which only guaranteed long-run growth – an early instance of the so-called ‘‘Dutch disease” (The Economist, 1977).

A more recent literature shifts the attention from the negative effects of long-term trends in terms of trade on economic growth to the negative effects of their volatility. Macroeconomic shocks are a major drag on economic growth, and volatility of terms of trade is a major source of those shocks in small open economies (cf. e.g. Turnovsky and Chattopadhyay, 2003; Romero-Avila, 2009; Poelhekke and van der Ploeg, 2009). Indeed, terms of trade volatility comes out to be negatively correlated to rate of growth after World War Two (Mendoza, 1997; Turnovsky and Chattopadhyay, 2003) and also before 1939 (Blattman et al., 2007).1 This latter paper finds that the negative effect of volatility on growth was very substantial: a 1% increase in volatility reduced growth rate by 0.08 percentage points. They also argue that the problem was more serious for countries in the Periphery than in the Core. Exports from Core countries were more diversified and consisted mainly in manufactures. Diversification by itself would help even if ‘‘world” prices for all products were equally volatile, provided that prices of different goods were poorly correlated. A specialization in manufacturing would reduce further volatility as prices of industrial products are structurally less volatile than those for primary products (Jacks et al., 2009). In fact, Blattman et al. (2007) find a positive, albeit not very high (0.38), correlation between volatility of terms of trade and the share of primary products on exports in 1870. This result has an important implication. Modern economic growth should trigger a virtuous circle, to the extent that it causes a country to diversify its exports and increase the share of manufactures (Kuznets, 1967). This change in the trade structure would reduce volatility and the decrease in volatility should foster further growth. The positive effects of this virtuous circle cannot be fully appreciated in the multi-country, cross-section approach which prevails in the current literature. One needs to trace the long-run change for a single country. This paper opens up this line of research. The case-study is Italy from its political unification (1861) to the eve of World War Two. In those eighty years, the country experienced the first stage of its modern economic growth, which was to be completed its ‘‘economic miracle” in the 1950s and 1960s (Zamagni, 1993; Cohen and Federico, 2001). As sketched out in Section Two, the GDP per capita rose, the share of primary production on GDP declined and the composition of Italian exports and imports changed substantially. Not by chance, authors find it difficult to nail Italy down in a simple dichotomy between Core and Periphery: Blattman et al. (2007) list it among the Core countries, alongside with the United Kingdom, while Williamson (2008) demotes Italy in European periphery, with Russia and Spain. Which effects had this structural transformation on its terms of trade? Did it improve or worsen them? Did it reduce volatility as expected – thereby fostering economic growth- or not? This paper answers to these questions with a new comprehensive data-base of Italian trade, based on the very detailed official sources (Movimento Commerciale del Regno d’Italia) from 1863 to 1939.2 Section Three provides the basic information about the data-base and the construction of the new index of terms of trade and discusses its long-term changes and volatility. Section Four shows that imports mattered as much as exports both for long-term trends of terms of trade and for their short-term volatility. The role of imports is totally neglected in the current literature, which focuses exclusively on the volatility of exports. Section Five explores the effects of changes in the composition of trade – and thus ultimately of modern economic growth- on trends and volatility. Section Six sums us and draws some lessons of general interest.
2. Trade and modern economic growth in Italy: a long-run view
Over the period 1861–1939, the Italian GDP per-capita more than doubled, growing at the yearly rate of about 1.0%.3 The growth was quite slow after the Unification, accelerated in the 1880s and, after a short set-back in the 1890s, peaked in the 1900s and early 1910s (Graph 1). The war-time boom is obviously spurious, but Italy enjoyed another short spell of high growth in the early 1920s before being hit by the Great Depression. In spite of these short spells of fast growth, Italy’s performance was far from outstanding. As the lower (dotted) line shows, the Italian GDP per capita was about 55% the British one in the 1860s and was still about 55% in the 1930s, after having slid by ten points at the turn of the century. Modern economic growth did bring about a structural transformation of the economy (Graph 2, solid line). In the 1860s, agriculture and mining accounted for about 80% of the Value Added of the production of tradables (and for about a half of the whole GDP). Their share declined very slowly until the 1890s, but afterwards the trend accelerated and went on quite steadily (but for a spurious collapse in war-time) until the late 1930s. By then, production of primary products was down to a half of the production of tradables (and to slightly above a quarter of GDP). Trade increased faster than total GDP, at least until the Great Depression. From the mid 1860s to 1929 peak, exports increased by 6.1 times and imports by 7.3, and the degree of openness (Graph 2, dotted line) almost tripled. The depression did cause trade to fall, but even at their historical minimum in 1936, exports and imports were still 3.6 and 3.2 times higher than seventy years before and the degree of openness was substantially higher.
1 As it is well known, the growth regressions industry suffers of over-determination – too many variables vying for attention. Sala-i-Martin et al. (2004) test the relevance of many of them with a meta-Bayesian approach, but unfortunately volatility of terms of trade is not in their list. The rate of change in terms of trade in the 1960s fares very poorly. 2 This database (Bankit-FTV) was developed by G. Federico, G. Tattara and M. Vasta in a project supported by Banca d’Italia. See for details Federico et al. (in press). 3 Data from Fenoaltea (2005) for 1861–1913 and Ercolani (1969 tab XIII 1.1.A) for 1914-1939. As all rates in the paper, this figure is obtained by running a log-linear regression with time, adjusting when necessary for autocorrelation. The preferred specification includes a dummy for war years 1915–1918. Omitting it does not affect results in a meaningful way.

As expected, this growth in trade was accompanied by a massive change in its composition (Graph 3 and Appendix, Table I).4 Indeed, the hypothesis of equal composition in 1863–1867 and 1935–1939 is soundly rejected.5 Yet, the change did not tally wholly with expectations, especially on the import side. The share of primary products was high in the 1860s because Italy had to import a lot of them – not only colonial wares, oil and cotton, but also all the coal it needed. Since then, the share increased only by few percentage points, in spite of the start of massive imports of wheat in the 1880s and the huge increase in imports of cotton and coal related to industrialization. Modern economic growth affected much more the composition of exports. In the early 1860s, primary products (silk, wine, olive oil, sulphur and so on), accounted for 85% of the total. Italy de

4 The Italian trade statistics reported, for each product (‘‘voce”), price, quantity and value of total trade and of trade with all trading partners (although the data-base covers only the ten main ones and the colonies). Until 1921 prices were determined by an Official Committee, on the basis of a wide-ranging enquiry among businessmen, Chamber of Commerce and other state agencies (see for details Federico et al., in press). The classification of flows has changed several times in the period, with a growing level of detail (up to thousands of different ‘‘voci” since the late 1900s). Thus, they have been re-classified according to the SITC classification (Revision 2) at four-digit level, with one major exception, raw silk. The SITC includes it with other textile fibers in manufactures (class 65), but with the 19th century technology, raw silk was clearly a primary product. The agricultural raw material, the silk cocoons, accounted for about 80% of the sale price (Federico, 1997). Table I, Appendix, reports the shares of one-digit SITC categories: primary products in graph 3 are defined as the classes 0 to 4 plus raw silk. 5 A v2 test (on two-digit SITC categories) rejects the hypothesis for both exports and imports at 0.00%. The hypothesis of constant composition between 1935-1939 and 1963 (the end of the ‘‘economic miracle”) is likewise rejected at 0.00% (data from United Nation, UN Comtrade, http://comtrade.un.org, accessed in May 2009).

pended on primary products as much as the poorest Third World countries in the 1980s and 1990s (Razzaque et al., 2007b). Furthermore ‘‘manufactures” were more often the product of artisanal workshops than of modern factories. The share of manufactures (mostly textile products – cotton yarns and fabrics, silk cloths and so on) started to inch upwards in the 1890s, and the process was fastened by the World War One and the subsequent collapse of German exports. In the late 1930s, manufactures accounted for about half total exports, and Italy succeeded to sell abroad (and to its colonies) also machinery and other more sophisticated products. Thus the composition of Italian exports was converging towards the norm for ‘‘advanced” countries. In 1870 the share of primary products on Italian exports was double the average of Core countries, which included the United States, while by 1939 it was ‘‘only” a third higher (Blattman et al., 2007). The share of primary products declined further after World War One. Since the 1970s manufactures, including substantial quantities of mechanical and engineering products, have accounted for around 85% of total exports (Vasta, 2010). Imports and exports differed also for the level of diversification of trade flows (Table 1). In the 1860s, the most important primary product, silk, accounted for about a quarter of total exports.6 Its share on exports declined steadily since the late 1890s and on the eve of World War Two silk lost its position of main staple to dried fruits, while cotton fabrics became Italy’s most important export, accounting for 4.6% of the total. Even at the beginning of the period, Italian exports were much less concentrated than those of typical peripheral countries: the average Herfindhal–Hirschman index for African countries was 0.48 in 1962 and 0.35 in 1995 (Cashin and Pattilo, 2006: Tab. 2). Primary products have always been the most important single item (with several changes in ranking among them) also on the import side. However, none of them ever exceeded a sixth of total imports and the sum of the top five products accounted for a third. Furthermore, imports do not show any trend towards less concentration. Thus, they were more diversified than exports in the 1860s, but less diversified in the late 1930s. This fact seems important to the extent that concentration in few products, ceteris paribus, increases volatility.

3. The terms of trade: change and volatility
The introduction of new products and the repeated changes in classification of existing ones makes it impossible to single out a sample of products which can be both sufficiently representative and constant over the whole period. Therefore the new index is computed in three stages. In the first stage, we have built Paasche and Laspeyres price micro-indexes for 64 two-digit SITC categories.7 We have used prices of single products or unit values for four-digit SITC categories, aiming at covering a sufficiently high share of the total value of each two-digit SITC category.8 We have been quite successful, as the products we consider account for 60% to 70% of total imports throughout the whole period, while the share for exports ranges between 70% and 80% up to the 1920s, to fall to 50–60% only in the final years. In the second stage, we have obtained Laspeyres and Paasche indexes for the whole trade, weighting the 64 category-specific indexes with the shares of these categories on total trade. Finally, we have computed the final (Fisher) index as a geometric average of aggregate Laspeyres and Paasche indexes. Graph 4 reports the new index alongside with the series by Glazier et al. (1975), which is the standard reference in the international literature, including Blattman et al. (2007) and Williamson (2008).9 The new series is stationary (at 5%) and trendless: the yearly rate of change in log-linear regression with time is 0.15% from 1863 to 1913, 0.83% from 1914 to 1939 and 0.002% over the whole period. None of these coefficients is significant.10 In contrast, the Glazier et al. (1975) index features a steady decline over the period 1863–1913 (at a remarkable 0.45% yearly rate, corresponding to a 20% cumulated change). As the graph shows, trends diverged markedly before 1875. Thereafter longterms rates are very similar, but short-term movements remain very poorly correlated.11 In all likelihood, this divergence between the two indexes reflects technical differences in the coverage and methods.12 In comparative perspective, the Italian

7 Actually, there are only 63 categories at two-digit level in SITC, revision 2. We add raw silk as the 64th category, given its importance in Italian trade. The Paasche and Laspeyres indexes are obtained as:
IPL 1⁄4 P v1it
pi0 pit
100 ILP 1⁄4 X vi0
pit
pi0
100
where vi0 is the share of value of product i on total value at time 0 (base period) and vit is the share of value of product i on total value at time t (the period for which the index is calculated); pi0 is the price of product i at time 0; and pit is the price of product i at time t. 8 Prices of single products usually refer to commodities, such raw silk and olive oil on export side, coal, cotton and wheat on import side. These products account on average for 36.6% and 46.7% respectively of total exports and imports. 9 One should mention a third series of terms of trade (Ercolani 1969), which however does not bring much additional information. Indeed it is essentially flat over the whole period and changes by over 5 percentage points in three years only, all during wartime or its aftermath. Unfortunately, the author only states that they are Laspeyres indexes (pp. 466–467), without any further information. 10 The hypothesis of stationarity is rejected for the period 1914–1939, while it comes very close to be accepted (a t-stat of 2.58, corresponding to a 10.4% significance) for the years 1863–1913. 11 The hypothesis of equal rates of change over the whole period 1863–1913 is rejected at 10%. In 1875–1913, the rates are almost identical ( 0.41% for the Glazier et al. and 0.44% for Federico-Vasta) but the coefficients of correlation are 0.57 for levels and 0.157 for first differences. 12 Glazier et al. (1975) measures British terms of trade with Italy, which differs from (total) Italian terms of trade for a number of reasons. Goods are valued at British ports and thus imports into Italy exclude transportation costs and exports from Italy include them. The composition by product differed: Italy exported to England comparatively little silk (Federico, 1979) and imported no wheat from it, although it did import most of its coal and cotton. Last but not least, until 1904, the British statistics registered imports and exports according to the country of consignment rather than to the actual country of origin and destination (Federico and Tena, 1991). Thus, Italian lemons embarked in Le Havre were registered as import from France.

performance is not impressive. Over the period 1870–1939, most countries of the Hadass–Williamson sample experienced an increase in terms of trade.13 Volatility is usually measured with the standard deviation of yearly changes. These latter can be computed as the first difference from logs of unadjusted series (Jacks et al., 2009) or as residuals from trends. Table 2 reports results from three different methods of extracting trend, a log-linear interpolation and two versions of Hodrick-Prescott filter, unadjusted (k = 100) and adjusted (k = 6.25) for annual data (Ravn and Uhling, 2002). As expected, the volatility of Italian terms of trade comes out to have been higher after than before the war. But how did Italy compare with other countries? Both Blattman et al. (2007) and Williamson (2008) measure volatility with the standard deviation from an adjusted Hodrick-Prescott filter – and thus their data are strictly comparable with the figures in column HP (k = 6.25). Blattman et al. (2007) cover 35 countries over the period 1870–1939. In the same period, volatility exceeds the Italian one (a SD of 4.56) in all countries except Sweden (4.09), but including Germany (4.75) and the United Kingdom (4.83). The standard deviation is about three fifths of the average for the peripheral countries in Europe (including Sweden) and less than half of the average for peripheral countries outside Europe. However this comparison is subject to two conflicting biases. From one hand, Blattman et al. (2007) omit the years 1911–1920, while our series includes them. Terms of trade fluctuated widely during the war, and indeed omitting the 1910s, the Italian volatility falls further to 4.10 – i.e. as low as the Swedish one. On the other hand, for most Peripheral countries, Blattman et al. (2007) have to build their own series of terms of trade, using a common index of import prices and computing country-specific indexes for export prices, which cover only a selected range of commodities. This method is bound to overestimate volatility of terms of trade for countries with fairly diversified exports, if price shocks are not correlated across commodities. Indeed the standard deviation of a ‘‘Blattman-type” index of Italian terms of trade is 6.31 – i.e. 50% higher than the actual one, according to the index.14 However, even in this case, Italian terms of trade would remain less volatile than the average for Peripheral countries. Williamson (2008) uses country-specific sources rather than ad hoc indexes, and reports data for the United Kingdom, as the sole representative of Core countries, and 20 ‘‘peripheral” countries, for the period 1870–1913. The average volatility for these latter is 6.88 – i.e. more than double the Italian one (3.15) in the same years according to the new index. The Italian terms of trade were less volatile than those of any country in Williamson’s sample, but the United Kingdom (2.0). In a nutshell, both comparisons show that Italy did not fit at all with the conventional view of a high-volatility Peripheral country. In the standard framework, as outlined in the Introduction, low volatility is much more beneficial to long-term growth than improving terms of trade. From this point of view, Italy was lucky.
4. Imports: the neglected factor
The whole debate on terms of trade and the ‘‘natural resource curse” focuses almost obsessively on the export side. However, by definition, terms of trade depend as much on price of imports as on price of exports. Terms of trade can improve (worsen) even if export price remain perfectly stable if import prices fall (rise). By definition, imports and exports prices must have changed roughly at the same rate to keep terms of trade stable in the long run (Table 3, third row). However, the rates of changes in prices differ rather substantially between primary products and manufactures on both import and export sides, although differences are never significant. Thus, overall trends in terms of trade differ quite sharply between primary products only (Table 3, first row) and manufactures only (Table 3 second row). The cumulated change over the eighty years corresponds to 20% improvement for terms of trade for primary products and to a massive 60% worsening for manufactures. A similar reasoning holds true for volatility as well.15 Fluctuations in import prices would affect terms of trade as much as fluctuations in export prices of the same width, unless of course import and export prices are correlated. How much did exports and imports contribute to overall volatility? Answering to this question is straightforward if volatility is measured by the standard deviation of differences (Table 2). In almost 80% of cases, prices of imports and exports move in opposite direc

13 The authors thank Jeffrey Williamson for having shared his data with us. 14 The export price index is a weighted average of prices of silk, hemp, olive oil and rice on the London market provided by Blattman (http:// www.chrisblattman.org/, accessed February 2009). These four products accounted for about a half of total Italian exports in the 1860s but then their share declined steadily to less than 10% in the 1930s. Following Blattman et al. (2007), this export price index is then divided by a series of American manufactures export prices. The standard deviation of residuals of the resulting index from a HP filter (k = 6.25) is 6.31. The difference with the volatility of the chained index is significant at 1%. 15 In what follows, unless otherwise stated, volatility is always measured with residuals from a Hodrick–Prescott filter with k = 6.25.

tions (e.g. import price rise and export fall or vice versa) and imports drive 37 out of a total of 76 movements. However, this simple computation may be biased to the extent that the yearly total changes include the effect of long-term trends in imports and exports. Residuals from de-trended series are not subject to this bias, but in this case total volatility is the sum of four components – (i) volatility of residuals of exports from de-trended series; (ii) volatility of residuals of imports from detrended series; (iii) divergence among de-trended series, if filtered separately; (iv) co-variance of residuals. Total volatility is positively related to the first three components and negatively to covariance. As Table 4 shows, imports are significantly more volatile than exports, and the difference reflects mainly the high volatility of prices of imported primary products. They were significantly more volatile than prices of manufactures, as expected, but also than prices of exported commodities. Indeed, prices of the three main imported commodities (wheat, coal and cotton), which jointly accounted on average for about one quarter of total imports, were significantly more volatile than prices of the three main staples (silk, olive oil and wine), which accounted for a similar proportion of exports.16 The contribution of different sources of volatility can be estimated by regressing the squared residual of terms of trade on the squared residuals of imports and exports and co-variance (Table 5). As all series are expressed in the same units, the interpretation of results is straightforward: a 1% increase in volatility of imports or exports, taking into account covariance, augments total volatility by the coefficient. The coefficient for exports is somewhat higher in all three regressions, but the hypothesis of equality is clearly rejected only for manufactures. Furthermore, the lower coefficients for imports are compensated by the greater absolute value of the variable.

Summing up, the lack of resources forced Italy to pick two tickets at the commodity lottery, one for its exports and one for its imports. The latter was fairly good in terms of long-run growth but it was decidedly poor in terms of volatility.
5. The effect of industrialization
As said in the Introduction, the change in composition of trade brought about by modern economic growth should, ceteris paribus, reduce volatility and thus foster further growth. The composition of the Italian trade changed a lot (Section 2): did this change reduce volatility as hypothesized? It is possible to answer by computing counterfactual terms of trade with different sets of (fixed) weights. The underlying price series being always the same, any difference between these counterfactual series would reflect solely the effects of changes in weights – i.e. in the composition of trade and thus ultimately of modern economic growth. The two obvious choices for weights are the first (1863–1867) and the last (1935–1939) years of the period. We add also the five years 1909–1913 at the end of the longest and fastest spell of industrial growth in the whole period. The rates of change come out substantially different (Table 6). The null hypothesis of rates equal to the chained index is rejected at 5% for counterfactual estimates with 1863–1867 and 1909–1913 weights, but not for the 1935–1939 one. Given the difference in lengths between the two periods (50 versus 25 years), the extent of the changes can be better understood if the rates are cumulated over the three periods (Table 7).17 The first row reports, for sake of comparison, the cumulated change of the chained index. As already said, the terms of trade worsened somewhat in the period to World War One and improved substantially in the period after 1914. If the composition had remained constant since the Unification (‘‘weights 1863–1867”), they would have improved by 11% before 1913. This implies that the share of products whose relative prices were declining has increased on the export side and/or has decreased on the import side. In fact, the deterioration in terms of trade would have been even greater if, by some miracle, Italy had had the pre-war structure of trade since the 1860s (‘‘weights 1909–1913”). If the latter composition had remained constant up to the end of the period, the terms of trade would have declined by a further 5%. Luckily for Italy, this did not happen, and the change in composition after World War One helped to reverse the downward trend. Indeed the 1935–1939 composition (‘‘weights 19351939”) proved to be the most favorable of all three sets. The terms of trade would have improved by 41% after 1914 and by almost a tenth since Unification.18 The difference between the fall in terms of trade with 1863–1867 weights and the improvement with the 1935–1939 ones is a crude estimate of the effect of modern economic growth.19 In contrast, industrialization did not reduce volatility, as hypothesized in the Introduction. The volatility comes out at least 80% higher, and possibly more than double, if computed with the 1935–39 weights than if computed with the 1863–1867 ones (Table 8). This increase does not depend on changes in volatility of residuals, as Table 9 shows. For both aggregate imports and exports, the volatility of residuals is not higher with 1935–1939 weights than with the 1863–1867 ones. The volatility of prices of imported commodities did increase by a fifth, but this rise was not large enough to affect overall variability of imports. The table shows no change at all on the export side, in spite of the massive change in specialization and the very substantial diversification (Graph 2 and Table 1). By default, the increase in volatility in terms of trade must reflect greater fluctuations of the filtered series and/or a lower co-variance between the residuals of import and exports. Both effects have the right sign. The volatility of ratio of filtered series of exports to imports is 5% higher and covariance is 12% lower with the 1935–1939 weights than with 1863–1867 ones. The decrease in covariance reflects mostly the growing divergence between the composition of imports and exports.20 The coefficient of correlation between the shares of 2-digit SITC groups in imports and exports was as high as 0.40 in 1863–1867 and it more than halved to 0.17 in the late 1930s. The analysis so far lump together all changes in composition of trade, most notably including the growing diversification of exports. It is nevertheless possible to show how much diversification reduced volatility by computing the terms of trade, under the alternative assumption that Italy exported only four products. To minimize any potential selection bias, we have considered the four most important products in 1863–1867, 1935–1939 and on the average over the whole period (Table 10). As expected, volatility would have been significantly greater if Italian trade had been highly concentrated, and this result is robust to differences in the set of products. Italy avoided the worst effects of the commodity lottery because it could draw several tickets, both on import and export side, rather than one or two.
17 The figures are obtained as [(exp(r n) 1)] 100, where r is the rate of change from Table 6 over the relevant period and n is the number of years. The sum of cumulated changes in 1863-1913 and 1914-1939 differ from the total 1863-1939 because the rates are obtained with a stochastic procedure. All series with fixed weights can be found in Appendix, Tables V-VIII of Federico and Vasta (2009). 18 Terms of trade with the 1925–1929 weights would have increased from 1914 to 1939 by 21% – midway between the fall with the 1909–1913 weights and the rise with the 1935–1939 ones. This suggests that the change unfolded over the whole period 1914–1939. 19 The estimates would measure accurately the gains if: (i) all price changes were exogenous (Italy was a small country) and (ii) all changes in composition of trade could be attributed to modern economic growth. The first condition is surely met, while the second is of course debatable. 20 One cannot attribute all changes in co-variance between imports and exports to differences in composition because they might reflect also different shortterm movement in prices for the 2-digit SITC categories. Prices of individual products sometimes differed between imports and exports and, above all, the micro-indexes for 2-digit SITC categories have often been computed with different products, which have been selected in order to maximize the coverage of these indexes.

6. Conclusion
This paper is the first outcome of a large research project on Italian trade. It has provided some basic information about long-term trends and focuses on terms of trade. Its results can be summed in a single sentence. The change in trade composition improved the Italian terms of trade, but it did not reduce volatility. In contrast with expectations, this latter was

very low when Italy was a poor and backward country, but it doubled during the first stage of its process of modern economic growth. This latter forced Italy to import a growing amount of basic commodities, whose prices are usually more volatile, at a time when prices in international markets were becoming more volatile. As a result, in volatility terms, Italy moved from the Core to the (low rank) of Peripheral countries. This result implies just the opposite of the virtuous circle hypothesized in the Introduction. If conventional wisdom about the harmfulness of high volatility is right, we have to conclude that low volatility should have helped modern economic growth at its beginning but it harmed it afterwards. If this was the case, the actual 1% yearly growth rate in GDP per capita would appear under a rather different light – as a quite good performance in spite of not-so-good odds. The case of Italy suggests three important qualifications to the conventional wisdom:
(i) Timing matters. An exogenous increase (decline) in price volatility on international markets can augment (reduce) the volatility of terms of trade, with positive (negative) effects on modern economic growth. This statement, of course, holds true only if the country is a price-taker, but this was by far the most common case. (ii) Imports matter. Long-term changes and short-term volatility depend as much on import side as on export side, and on the co-variance between the two. Imports can be a major source of macroeconomic shocks if they feature a high proportion of highly volatile commodities. Abundance of natural resources would reduce, ceteris paribus, this risk, although it may have other negative consequences including the Dutch disease. In contrast, development per se would not help much, although it is likely to increase the capacity of a country to withstand a given shock. (iii) Diversification matters. The more diversified trade is, the lower the impact of fluctuations of prices of any specific commodity on imports or export prices and thus the lower volatility of terms of trade. Furthermore, the more similar imports and exports are in terms of product composition, and thus the higher the covariance of their prices is, the lower overall volatility must be. In other words, all estimates of import and export prices (and hence of terms of trade) based on partial product coverage are likely to overestimate volatility (Bidarkota and Crucini, 2000). By definition, ceteris paribus, the bias is bound to be greater the lower the share of covered products on total trade is.
In short, modern economic growth does not necessarily reduce volatility. The changes in composition of trade flows may reduce the covariance in prices between import and exports and thus increase volatility. Furthermore, industrialization may increase volatility by forcing a resource-poor country to import growing quantities of highly volatile raw materials and agricultural products, possibly compensating the decline in volatility from changes of composition of exports. Volatility of terms of trade is likely to fall permanently only when both import and export consist mainly of manufactures. This case has become much more common as of late, with the great increase in intra-industry trade and, quite recently, of outsourcing of industrial processing. None of these qualifications rules out the possibility that conventional wisdom could be true in some cases, or perhaps in the majority. However, they suggest the need for additional empirical work before drawing inferences.
