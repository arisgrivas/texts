Introduction
From the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 until the onset of World War I in 1914, the regions of Central, Eastern, and Southeastern Europe (CESEE) experienced slow but rising integration with the economies of Western Europe and the rest of the global economy. This process occurred fitfully, both over time and across the three Empires – Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman (and the subsequent Balkan states of Greece, Romania, Serbia, and Bulgaria), and Russian – that dominated the region. Despite an incomplete quantitative record, it appears that trade, capital, and population flows between CESEE and the rest of the world saw largely positive growth over the period. Telegraph and railroad lines slowly spread across the region, educational and cultural connections deepened, and technological transfers occurred. Overall, these parts of Europe became less peripheral to the rest of the global economy, as the region participated in the wave of economic globalization over the long 19th century. The economies of CESEE grew slowly more connected to the rest of the world, but the effects of these developments are less clear, as convergence with Western European economies remained partial at best (cf. Chapter 3). With the exception of parts of the Habsburg lands, exports from the region were largely primary and semi-processed commodities, while imports were overwhelmingly manufactured goods produced in Western European factories. As Williamson (2011) points out, the European periphery (including Russia) saw rising terms of trade (export prices over import prices) over the first half of the “long 19th century” (1800–1914) before stagnation and even slow decline up to the first World War. The initial rise in the terms of trade for CESEE reinforced de-industrialization in some parts of the region. The eventual leveling off of the terms of trade was associated with declining trade costs, the rapid increase in agricultural competition from the Americas since

the 1870s, and falling primary commodity prices, leading to adverse consequences for agriculture throughout CESEE. The long-run secular decline in industrial import prices caused initial movements towards trade liberalization to give way to higher levels of protectionism, although political pressures from Western Europe partially limited such barriers. Overall, these trade developments slowed the onset of modern industrial development in the region, and CESEE remained essentially agricultural through the onset of World War I. Capital flows acted as another channel of integration with the global economy. The 19th century saw the CESEE economies attract immense capital inflows, as Western companies and investors (largely European but a few American) sought out high returns, encouraged in part by policies and implicit political guarantees of CESEE states. Imperial Russia became the largest net borrower in the world over the period, while the rest of the region also saw significant levels of foreign investment. These capital flows came in all forms, from sovereign debt purchases, to direct investments, to the acquisition of equity shares floated domestically or on exchanges abroad. Foreign capital was particularly critical in the construction of railroads and other infrastructure projects, as well as in the initial stages of modern industrial activity. Underpinning these capital inflows were the growing presence of Western European banks in the region, the integration and cross-listing of securities in CESEE and Western exchanges, and, towards the end of the period, the adoption of the gold standard by all countries in the region. Although capital inflows generated additional investment and enabled the transfer of modern transportation and industrial technologies, dependence on such flows generated large payment outflows while possibly fueling macroeconomic instability. Finally, CESEE labor markets were increasingly integrated with those of Western Europe and the rest of the global economy, especially after 1870. Although low incomes, high transportation costs, and various institutional restrictions limited labor mobility over much of the century, the slow easing of these constraints allowed for rising temporary and permanent domestic, regional, and international flows of workers and households. Rural migrants fueled urban growth in CESEE cities and came to constitute a large share of the seasonal agricultural labor force in Western Europe. Intercontinental emigration from Austria-Hungary, Russia (approximately half of whom were Jews from the Pale of Settlement), and Greece grew after 1870, making them some of the largest migrant-sending countries to the Americas by the onset of World War I. By contrast, Bulgaria, Romania, and Serbia generated insignificant numbers of emigrants during the same period (for reasons that are not entirely understood). While those who moved to exploit opportunities elsewhere likely experienced substantial welfare gains (often including greater political and religious rights), this conjecture is based on imperfect information regarding migrant selection, relative living standards in sending and receiving locations, remittance patterns, and net flows. Moreover, the available wage evidence implies a relative stagnation of income levels in the region, suggesting that CESEE labor flows in the “Age of Mass Migrations” were not sufficient to generate significant

convergence processes with global economic leaders in the face of persistent and substantial internal and external impediments. This chapter explores the growing connections between the CESEE region and the economies of Western Europe (and the rest of the world) over the long 19th century. We cover Austria(-Hungary), Imperial Russia, and the emerging Balkan countries which obtained autonomy and, eventually, political independence in a drawn-out process (Serbia: 1817/1878; Greece: 1821/1832; Romania: 1859/1878; and Bulgaria: 1878/1908). We also include the Ottoman Empire, if and when the relevant data and sources allow us to distinguish the European part from the rest of the empire. Where appropriate, we borrow language from an open-economy, general equilibrium framework based on fixed (geographic endowments) and mobile (labor and capital) productive factors (e.g. O’Rourke and Williamson, 1999). Such a structure informs our discussion of whether trade, capital flows, and labor mobility, in the context of specific institutional, technological, and policy-related changes in CESEE, generated forces for economic convergence within the region and with the global economic leaders. In doing this, we link national processes of factor and goods market integration with regional and international ones. We begin by describing the underlying technological, institutional, and policy context within CESEE over the long 19th century. We then analyze commonalities and points of variation across the region in how internal and external trade, capital, and labor market integration took place. The focus is on the region as a whole, but our evidence is often pulled from national statistical sources and country-specific research, which necessarily weighs our discussion towards parts of CESEE with better empirical information on particular topics in different time periods. The concluding section considers some general issues of the welfare consequences of the growing economic ties between CESEE and the rest of the world.
The institutional, infrastructure, and policy context
Between the Congress of Vienna (1815) and World War I, CESEE was politically divided among three Empires – the Russian, the Ottoman, and the Austrian (since 1867 the Austro-Hungarian Empire, conferring equal status to Hungary within the monarchy) – and four comparatively small Balkan countries which managed to first gain de facto and then de jure independence. The three empires maintained spheres of economic and political influence that grew, contracted, and overlapped over the century. A long series of military conflicts and subsequent peace treaties marked the steady detachment of the Ottoman Empire from Southeastern Europe; a vacuum filled in the 17th and 18th centuries by Austria but in the 19th century by the emergence of the Balkan states. The Russian Empire frequently interfered in the region, both formally and informally, often under a Pan-Slavic banner. At the same time, Russian colonial efforts in Central Asia and the Caucasus advanced, while political and economic engagement in East Asia grew. These developments generated increasingly complicated relationships and growing tensions among the


100 Steven Nafziger and Matthias Morys
empires and between CESEE and external powers, culminating in the Crimean War (1853–1856), the Balkan Crisis (1875–1878)/Russo-Turkish war of 18771878, the Russo-Japanese War (1905) and, eventually, World War I. Underlying the growing interactions of CESEE with Western Europe and the rest of the global economy were technological improvements in communications and transportation. Telegraph lines were built from Western Europe to Istanbul via Bucharest and Black Sea cables during the Crimean War, and the subsequent decades saw the density of lines increase throughout the region before the conversion to telephone began in the 1880s (Ehrlich, 1985; Russia, Ministerstvo, 1875). The building of communication lines tended to parallel the construction of the railways, which began slowly but then grew across the region. Beginning in the 1870s, rail lines connected the industrialized regions of Western Europe to St. Petersburg, Moscow, Warsaw, Bucharest, and Istanbul. The construction of trunk lines was followed by the slow filling in of the networks, with significant implications for internal market integration and the creation of linkages between CESEE’s agricultural hinterlands and global markets (Good, 1984, pp. 99–104; Lampe and Jackson, 1982, Ch. 6; Goodwin, 1998; Metzger, 1974; Turnock, 2006, Ch. 3). Advances in technology also enabled a significant expansion of steamship lines, which played an essential role in reducing riverine (Volga, Dnieper, Danube, and other basins) and oceanic (Baltic, Black, Mediterranean, and the Atlantic) transportation costs (Williamson, 2011, p. 15). Table 5.1 reports the growth of the region’s rail networks and the number of telegrams sent over the period. Austria-Hungary experienced steady rail and communication growth (with levels approaching those of Germany), while Russia saw a delayed but rapid acceleration of its network building beginning in the 1870s. Overall, the Balkans experienced a slower expansion of rail and telegraph lines. Canal building was important in parts of European Russia, as evidenced by successfully connecting the Baltic and the Caspian Seas by means of the Volga-Baltic Waterway, while the advent of steam and rail made even longer trade routes cost-effective to transverse. Finally, the 19th century saw regional and international shipping, shipbuilding, and merchant trading expand, especially in Greece and among Greek-expatriate populations in the region (Harlaftis and Kostelenos, 2012). Such ethnic networks (including Jewish ones) functioned as a means to lower transaction costs in the absence of fully secure governmental arrangements (or low-cost maritime insurance) for international trade across the region. In writing about Eastern Europe, Alexander Gerschenkron (1962) emphasized the role that state policies could play in overcoming economic backwardness by substituting for other prerequisites of economic growth. As discussed by Pammer and Tuncer in Chapter 4 of this volume, the long 19th century saw slow but evident improvements in state capacity within much of CESEE, with rising tax collections and public service provision, especially after 1900. The very creation of new nation-states – Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia, and Romania – may have generated some momentum in this direction, although they often found it difficult to

knit together effective government services in their formative years (Becker et al., 2016). The Russian Empire and other polities in the region began to slowly engage in proactive economic development policies, from building, running, and subsidizing transportation and communication networks, to providing credit towards specific sectors, to undertaking health and educational initiatives in urban and rural areas. However, it is important not to overstate these achievements, for by the 20th century the CESEE regimes were still far from the emerging social welfare states of Western Europe (Lindert, 2004). Domestic policies created the groundwork for agricultural exports and the first steps towards industrial development in the region. Although protectionism and political tensions eventually emerged (from the late 1870s onwards) in response to cheap foreign manufactures, the states of CESEE largely evolved open policies with respect to capital and labor flows (see below and Chapter 4 in this volume) – a set of policies helped by the movement towards currency policies to maintain gold convertibility. Although external influences also played a role, CESEE domestic policies were critical for moving the region away from peripheral status and towards integration with the Western European and global economies (Gregory, 1994; Lains, 2002; Williamson, 2011). The CESEE’s experience of economic integration with Western Europe and the rest of the global economy took place amidst this backdrop of institutional development, infrastructure building, and policymaking. Moreover, the rising

economic weight of the region in European and global affairs led to growing external involvement – expressed in military and diplomatic terms – in CESEE. This was true despite the relatively low level and slow pace of income growth throughout the period (cf. Chapter 3). The generally poor record of CESEE growth during the long 19th century suggests that despite growing integration with the global economy, the region saw limited convergence with the advanced industrial nations. Thus despite some localized industrial growth in Austria, Russia, and elsewhere in the region, particularly right before World War I, the overall story is arguably one of CESEE falling behind during the 19th century (cf. Chapter 3 by Kopsidis and Schulze). Marx, Lenin, Gerschenkron, and other writers have blamed exploitative military and economic policies of Western powers, backward institutions, and other factors for the lagging performance of CESEE. In the following, we argue that the various processes of integration with the rest of the global economy were not always smooth even though on balance they were helpful. In exploring three channels – trade flows, capital market integration, and labor migration that increasingly connected CESEE to the rest of the global economy, the rest of the chapter interprets the region’s experience as part of the broader globalization debate.
Trade
Amidst prevailing mercantilist policies, Imperial Russia, the Ottoman lands, and the Habsburg Empire were all engaged in trade with each other and with Western Europe well before 1800 (Attman, 1981; Good, 1984; Kahan, 1985; Lampe and Jackson, 1982). Furs, lumber, agricultural products, handicraft textiles, and a variety of other commodities were traded through Baltic, Mediterranean, and Black Sea ports, as well as over land and riverine routes. Ottoman traders interfaced between East and West. Russian merchants traveled east into Central Asia and Siberia, while thick Greek, Jewish, and Serbian trading networks developed (Stoianovich, 1960). Trade expansion was sometimes helped by imperial conquest. By the end of the 18th century, Russia’s control of the Black Sea coast was firmly established, leading to the further development of Odessa and other ports, providing easier access to the agricultural riches of Ukraine and the Volga basin (Herlihy, 1986). Yet it required substantial improvements in transportation and policy interventions to enable the growth in trade in the 19th century, and after 1870 in particular. The rise in international trade flows emerged out of the growing domestic integration of the CESEE economies. Domestic and international trade expansion were largely due to the same transportation and communication improvements, but domestic political factors and policy choices also played a significant role. Railroad network expansion since the 1840s and the formation of a customs union between Austria and Hungary in 1848 increased internal trade in the Hapsburg Empire (Good, 1984; Komlos, 1983). Mid-century reforms ended most internal trade taxes in Imperial Russia, while state funding and bond guarantees for railways supported the deepening of the transportation network after 1870. These factors not only


Economic integration with Western Europe 103
helped knit internal Russian markets together, but they also enabled the transportation of grain and other primary commodities for export via the Baltic and emerging Black Sea ports (Falkus, 1966; Goodwin and Grennes, 1998; Metzger, 1974; Mironov, 1985). Yet trade integration was not without obstacles. Trade along ethnic lines imposed persistent friction in market integration in the late Habsburg Empire (Schulze and Wolf, 2012), and the political disintegration of the Ottoman Empire on the Balkan Peninsula counteracted infrastructure-driven trade improvements, with overall effects mired in controversy (Palairet, 1997; Morys and Ivanov, 2015). Trade growth and pro-trade policies often reinforced each other. Starting in the 1890s, all countries in the region began stabilizing their currencies vis-à-vis gold and were able to maintain relatively stable exchange rates to their main trading partners, notably Britain, France, and Germany (Drummond, 1976; Morys, 2017). This probably boosted trade further (Lopez-Cordova and Meissner, 2003), but it is also true that earlier trade improvements had been a vital component of joining the gold standard in the first place. How much and with whom did the CESEE economies trade? Tables 5.2 and 5.3 provide information on trade openness and trade shares over the 1870–1913 period for which we have relatively good data both for gross domestic product (GDP) and trade. Table 5.2 also provides data for the European core countries as well as other economies on the European periphery. Our measure of trade openness – exports plus imports as share of GDP provides a straightforward indicator for how strongly a country interacts with the rest of the world in terms of trade. In periods of strong trade integration, trade is expected to grow faster than GDP. Table 5.2 documents this association for the core economies, Southern Europe, and the Nordic countries, in line with our general understanding of the so-called First Age of Globalisation (Daudin et al., 2010): all countries were more open in 1913 than in 1870, often by a considerable margin (cf. Belgium and Spain). The CESEE experience was more mixed. While some countries became more open over time (notably Russia and Romania, which had established themselves as the largest and fourth-largest wheat exporter globally by 1913), others moved in the opposite direction (Greece, Serbia). Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, for their part, hardly changed at all. The CESEE countries exhibited the lowest openness ratios of all European countries at the beginning of our period in 1870. In the case of Russia, the sheer size of the domestic market accounts for the low openness ratio in 1870; and the almost fivefold increases until 1913 (from 3.1% to 14.3%) are testimony to successfully developing the country’s export potential. Yet in other cases, a stagnating openness ratio suggests that not all CESEE economies fully took part in the First Age of Globalisation. Some were potentially held back by insufficient improvements in infrastructure, as documented for some Balkan countries such as Bulgaria (Morys and Ivanov, 2015, pp. 399–400). Table 5.3 provides trade shares for all CESEE economies except for the Ottoman Empire, where the data do not allow for a decomposition for the European part of the empire. Austria-Hungary and Russia conducted more than 60% of their


104 Steven Nafziger and Matthias Morys
trade with Britain, France, and Germany alone. There was some trade between the two empires, but numbers pale in comparison to their relationship with the Western European core economies. Russia, for its part, traded very little with the Ottoman Empire and the Balkan countries. These numbers document trade along the lines of comparative advantage. Western Europe – Britain and Germany in particular – dominated as suppliers of largely manufactured imports and as destinations for mostly primary commodity and semi-processed exports from the region (Bairoch, 1974; Khromov, 1950; Lampe and Jackson, 1982; Pamuk, 1987).

rationale also explains the almost complete absence of regional trade: the economic structures of the CESEE economies were too similar to generate a meaningful level of intra-CESEE trade. The same pattern can be observed for the much smaller economies of Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Serbia. Trade orientation vis-à-vis Western Europe appears marginally smaller, but such perspective neglects the importance – and the structure – of trade with Austria-Hungary. The dual monarchy remained an important trading partner to the four countries, largely exporting manufactured goods from its advanced regions of Lower Austria and Bohemia (Paskalleva, 1981; Preshlenova, 1994). Combining the data for Britain, France, Germany, and AustriaHungary shows again trade shares between 55% and 65% for the Balkan countries. Trade with the Ottoman Empire and Russia was negligible. What does the evidence on trade openness, trade shares, and price integration suggest about the broader economic experience of CESEE in the first wave of globalization? As Britain, Germany, and other industrial economies saw their growth accelerate from early in the 19th century onward, the CESEE economies experienced rising demand for primary commodities and semi-processed goods. At the same time, the slow increase in incomes across the region generated demand for rapidly cheapening Western manufactures. Together, these resulted in rising terms of trade for CESEE over the first two-thirds of the period, followed by


Economic integration with Western Europe 107
stabilization, and then a slow decline from roughly 1870 to World War I. This early rise in the terms of trade generated some momentum towards de-industrialization through the middle of the century, with traditional handicraft industries in particular coming under pressure from cheap imported manufactures. The later downward trajectory in the terms of trade was primarily driven by the so-called European Grain Invasion, namely the arrival of cheap agricultural produce from the Western hemisphere (and the United States in particular) in the markets of industrial Western Europe (O’Rourke, 1997). With New World and Eastern European agricultural producers increasingly competing with each other, terms of trade fell for the CESEE economies (and correspondingly rose for the industrialized core countries) (Pamuk and Williamson, 2011; Williamson, 2011). From the mid-1880s, the movements in relative prices supported the onset of industrialization in parts of the region, with a particular emphasis on light manufactures and processed agricultural and natural resources for domestic consumption and export. Yet this process, which has been shown econometrically for Austria, Hungary, and Russia (Benetrix et al., 2015), should not be overstated. As Chapter 3 documents, the primary sector remained more important until 1913 and drove overall GDP growth more strongly in the 1870–1913 period, in all CESEE economies bar Austria. Were the open economy forces behind the late development of industrialization helped or hindered by regional trade policies that turned increasingly protectionist in the 1880s and 1890s? In the absence of statistical evidence similar to that provided by Lehmann and O’Rourke (2011) for more advanced economies of the time, we are left with little more than conjectures regarding the effects of tariffs on growth and industrialization in CESEE. Following a window of relatively liberalized bilateral trade relations in the middle of the century, protectionism rose across much of Europe from the 1870s to the early years of the 20th century. This was particularly true for much of the CESEE, where tariffs rose to levels well above the European core (Table 5.4; Williamson, 2011). Such was the case for Russia, where average nominal tariffs rose from 13% to 35% between 1870 and 1890, remaining at a relatively high level until World War I. Similar developments took place in the Balkan countries, albeit slightly later and mildly less protectionist. Only Austria-Hungary resisted the trend (Good, 1984). Yet there appears to be important differences across countries. In the Russian case, there were elements of infant industry protection, with high tariffs applied selectively to some higher valued final manufacturing goods (i.e. railway equipment), although, simultaneously, many imported industrial inputs and agricultural commodities also faced substantial duties, often for fiscal and strategic reasons (Barnett, 2004; Crisp, 1976). In the Balkans, by contrast, tariffs on agricultural produce were typically higher than on industrial items, and the associated trade conflicts were typically with the neighbouring countries (Lampe and Jackson, 1982, pp. 264–269; Preshlenova, 1994). From the available statistical evidence it is probably only safe to conclude that the exceptionally high tariffs by the 1890s were an additional factor why the CESEE openness ratios remained low in international comparison (cf. above).

Capital flows
Foreign capital flows into the region, particularly over the three and a half decades prior to World War I, were an important factor in the early stages of economic modernization and industrialization in CESEE. This was particularly the case in Imperial Russia, which became, on some accounts (Falkus, 1979, p. 5), the largest net recipient of foreign investment in the world by the early 20th century. But foreign capital also played a key role in the economic development of AustriaHungary, the Ottoman Empire, and the emerging Balkan states. The main benefit of the vast capital flows was to supplement limited domestic savings, thereby allowing capital stock increases commensurate with the economic needs of the backward CESEE economies. Yet capital inflows to the region often embodied technological, managerial, and financial knowledge from more advanced economies, thus lending some support towards economic catch-up. As opposed to trade, capital overwhelmingly flowed one way: from the Western European economies (and from Britain, France, and Germany in particular) to the region. There were hardly any capital outflows1 and only very limited cross-border investments within the region (mainly Habsburg and Russian investments in the Balkans). On an economic level, capital flows were a force for good. In line with economic logic, they flowed from the capital intensive Western European economies

to the capital-scarce Eastern European economies, helping CESEE to catch up and providing investors with returns higher than they could have expected at home. Yet they also created vulnerabilities of both an economic and a political nature. The CESEE economies became dependent, to some degree, on the capital flow cycle set by the core economies: push factors (i.e. why core countries wanted to export capital) sometimes dominated pull factors (i.e. what made a particular CESEE country attractive for foreign investment). The debt defaults of Greece and Serbia in the 1890s, for instance, were mostly the result of poor macroeconomic management, yet these episodes also reflected a much reduced willingness of the core countries to lend overseas in the wake of the 1890 Baring financial crisis, an event totally unrelated to the region. In both cases, default eventually resulted in financial supervision, by which foreign creditor governments effectively took control of the countries’ fiscal policies. These were extreme cases of “foreign intrusion”, partly helped by the small size of the countries. But even in the Russian case, capital imports were seen as a mixed blessing at the time – spurring growth and cementing the emerging political alliance with France (where most of the capital came from), but also creating economic and political dependencies in the process. The severe banking crisis of 1899–1902 is a case in point, when money market turbulence in Western Europe generated profound consequences for Russian banks and industrial production (Lychakov, 2018). Foreign investments took different forms, namely sovereign lending, portfolio investments into corporate securities (bonds and stocks), and foreign direct investment (acquiring direct control over foreign-based companies as opposed to holding merely a financial stake). Only with the first item are we in a position to establish numbers with sufficient accuracy and make meaningful comparisons across countries, and even here only for the period after 1880. Table 5.5 summarizes in columns 2 to 7 the amount of public debt – in total and the share held abroad – and compares it to nominal GDP (debt-to-GDP and foreign debt-to-GDP). For the SEE countries, the statistical material does not allow to distinguish between total government debt and government debt held abroad. The sources we rely on suggest2 that essentially all government debt was held abroad or, at a minimum, at least placed abroad initially (there is some evidence of later debt repatriations closer to 1914). With this caveat in mind, we treat all SEE government debt as foreign-held. Four key findings emerge from Table 5.5. First, almost 80% of foreign investment into CESEE government debt went to two countries alone, with more than half to Russia and approximately a quarter to Austria-Hungary (column 5). This is roughly in line with the size of their economies and populations (161.7 million and 50.7 million in 1913, respectively, versus fewer than 5 million on average for the four Balkan countries). Probably more surprising is the large share of Romania, accounting for 8.4% of foreign investment by 1913. Romania was the only Balkan country which had achieved some industrialization by then (cf. Chapter 3 of this volume), and was perceived as a more promising and safer investment destination (including for government debt). Second, foreign lending began at different points in time for the six countries. In the cases of the Balkan countries, achieving

political independence (Romania and Serbia in 1878 at the Congress of Berlin), or at least obtaining wide-ranging autonomy (Bulgaria in 1878), and reaching a debt compromise with foreign creditors (Greece in 1878) became important political pre-conditions for the 1880s lending boom; with the exception of Greece in the 1820s and 1830s, there had been hardly any foreign lending to SEE before. Only Austria-Hungary and Russia had a history of foreign lending stretching further back in time. Engaged in imperial expansion and consolidation, the Russian government first took out foreign loans in the 18th century and became a serial borrower – both domestic and externally – by the 1820s, with debt issues floated in various Western European markets (Russia, Ministersvo, 1902). The dual monarchy had received substantial amounts of foreign capital in the 1850s and 1860s, often connected to railway construction (railways at the time were privately built but later taken over by the government, hence falling under government debt). Third, capital repatriations over time occurred in some cases. Almost 40% of Austro-Hungarian debt held abroad in 1892 was repatriated by 1913 (Morys, 2006, p. 176). This is probably best understood as a process in which a rapidly growing economy generated sufficient private savings to buy back debt initially placed abroad. The statistical evidence for Austria-Hungary is very robust, but the same phenomenon probably occurred in other parts of CESEE as well. It has even been argued that such debt repatriations created the need for local trading platforms, giving rise to stock exchanges in Belgrade and Sofia in the early 20th century (Battilossi and Morys, 2011).

Fourth, debt levels, including levels of foreign debt, were high across the region, but with pronounced differences between countries. Russia, AustriaHungary, and Romania fell in one camp: they never experienced debt repayment issues, even though debt-to-GDP on occasions rose above 70%. Such levels were deemed high at the time, as the government’s ability to tax was much lower than today (tax revenue to GDP was between 10% and 15%, roughly a third of today). Bulgaria, Greece, Serbia, and the Ottoman Empire (which we include here for illustrative purposes) fell in the other camp. Greece and Serbia accumulated vast amounts of debt in the 1880s, partly to finance ambitious infrastructure projects, partly for military build-up in an increasingly fragile Balkan environment, and partly to cover chronic budget shortfalls. Losing control over their debts in the process, they defaulted in 1893 and 1895, respectively, and subsequently agreed to financial supervision in an attempt to regain access to international capital markets. In so doing, they followed the example set by the Ottoman Empire in 1881, and foreshadowed the “pre-emptive” financial supervision of Bulgaria in 1902, when the country agreed to financial oversight over its finances in exchange for an international loan. All four cases together are at the origin of the region’s reputation for recurring cycles of overborrowing, debt default, and financial supervision (Tuncer, 2015). Foreign purchases of CESEE sovereign debt were part of broader portfolios that included corporate bonds and stocks traded on exchanges across Europe. Such purchases began shortly after large-scale sovereign debt issuance had taken off in the middle of the century. Railroad securities were of particular importance early on. While they typically constituted investments into private companies, they often enjoyed certain state guarantees such as minimum returns or protection in case of bankruptcy. This made them particularly attractive to foreign investors, and railroad securities came to form a considerable share of all securities purchased by foreign investors (cf. Solov’eva, 1989 for Russia and Lampe and Jackson, 1982 for the Balkan countries).3 Foreign portfolios diversified later on, taking important stakes in particular in mining, metallurgy, commercial banks, and textile and chemical production (cf. Moulton and Pasvolsky, 1924, p. 183 for the case of Russia). How important was portfolio investment compared to foreign holdings of government debt? Based on relatively robust data for Russia and Austria-Hungary, it appears that portfolio investment constituted approximately one-third of capital inflows at the end of our period. Less reliable data for Romania and Bulgaria suggest a lower number for these two economies, probably not even reaching 5% of total foreign investment (no comparable data are available for Greece and Serbia). Comparing the 1892 and 1913 spot estimates for Austria-Hungary suggests that portfolio investment increased over time both in absolute numbers and as a percentage of total foreign investment (13.1% in 1890 vs. 31.3% in 1913). Despite their inevitable flaws, these data deliver a consistent story across the region and point to informational asymmetries as a key determinant. In the early stages, foreign investors preferred government debt, where monitoring was easier; as they began to understand the CESEE economies better over time, they increasingly


Economic integration with Western Europe 113
shifted into more profitable portfolio investment, reaching up to one-third of total investment in the two large economies of Russia and Austria-Hungary on the eve of World War I. Last but not least, foreigners also invested directly in affiliates and set up standalone enterprises in CESEE from early in the period. These included corporations active in a variety of sectors, from finance to machinery to mining and oil extraction. The “free-standing” company founded by foreigners (particularly the British and French) emerged as a central feature of numerous Russian sectors, including the more advanced ones. A famous example was the Nobel Company, founded by the Swedish Nobel brothers and other investors in the late 1870s in Baku, which specialized in oil production and refinement. Such foreign direct investment (FDI) often entailed direct technological transfers from foreign firms to local actors, creating the possibility for knowledge spillovers within or across industries. The scale of such direct investment was probably quite large by the early 20th century, as Geyikdagi (2011) and Pamuk (1987) have documented for the Ottoman Empire, Falkus (1979) and McKay (1970) for Imperial Russia, Komlos (1983) for AustriaHungary, and Lampe and Jackson (1982) for the Balkans, even though exact numbers are difficult to establish by the very nature of this particular investment type. A considerable amount of sovereign lending, portfolio flows, and foreign direct investment occurred through banks. To the extent that bank financing was particularly important in the context of relatively thin securities markets (Gerschenkron, 1962), connections between foreign and CESEE banking systems were critical for the region’s experience of capital market integration. Many of the early commercial banks in the region were established as majority-owned affiliates of British, French, and German firms, with foreign owners providing much of the initial capitalization.4 Such banks aided foreign firms operating directly in the CESEE and engaged in the underwriting of corporate and sovereign securities for Western exchanges. By addressing information asymmetries, these banking networks played a fundamental role in linking CESEE securities markets and investment opportunities to Western European investors. Another perspective on capital market integration between the CESEE and the rest of the world is provided by considering the role of the region in the aggregate foreign investment portfolios of important external economies. For example, in examining the distribution of foreign investment across regions by Britain, France, and Germany in 1913–1914, Clemens and Williamson (2004) note that Eastern Europe (including Austria-Hungary but excluding the Ottoman areas) was of relatively limited importance to Britain (3.6%) in comparison to France (35.5%) and Germany (27.7%). Falkus (1979, pp. 20–32) notes that Russia was the largest recipient of French capital exports, with its share rising from about 17% in 1890 to 25% in 1900 before falling slightly, as France’s aggregate share of total foreign investment in Russia slowly declined from a height of over 50% in the 1890s to approximately 40% in 1914.5 Parent and Rault (2004) consider slightly different sources on the distribution of French assets abroad and estimate that the CESEE countries constituted roughly 40% of the aggregate portfolio by 1900 (with Russian


114 Steven Nafziger and Matthias Morys
assets approximately two-thirds of that amount).6 Relying on yet a different set of underlying sources, Tilly (1994) finds that roughly 80% of German foreign portfolio investment went to the CESEE, and to Austria-Hungary in particular (over 50% on its own). Although these numbers are isolated observations from the end of the period, it is clear that CESEE was the primary destination for much of Western European capital investment abroad, with only Britain turning more to opportunities in the Western hemisphere and its empire. It is worth noting that Austria-Hungary was an important investor in the Balkan countries (Lampe and Jackson, 1982). What accounts best for the very large capital inflows obtained by the CESEE countries over the course of the long 19th century? On some level, it could be argued, they merely took part in the First Age of Globalization, in which the Western core countries made substantial amounts of domestic savings available for foreign investment. Britain committed on average a third of its savings, or 4% of GDP, for a full four decades to foreign investment, resulting in a 42% share of global foreign investment by 1913 (Daudin et al., 2010, p. 10). From the perspective of an investor in a core country, the relative scarcity of capital in parts of the world such as CESEE meant higher returns. Yet there were also specific steps that the CESEE countries took to attract foreign investment. In particular, towards the end of the 19th century, they all tried to establish gold convertibility – that is, exchanging bank notes into physical gold – thereby ensuring fixed exchange rates to the core economies (all of which were on gold by that time). Maintaining convertibility implied restrictive monetary and fiscal policies, and served as a “Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval” for foreign investors (Bordo and Kydland, 1995; Bordo and Rockoff, 1996). This was a policy pursued throughout the region and often pushed by reform-minded politicians such as Finance Minister Sergei Witte in Russia (von Laue, 1963) and Prime Minister Trikoupis in Greece (Morys, 2016). But getting there was not easy. Austria-Hungary, for instance, required a full 37 years between 1859 and 1896 to stabilize its exchange rate. Romania and Russia adopted the gold standard in the 1890s (1891 and 1896, respectively), with Bulgaria, Serbia, and Greece following in the next decade (1906, 1909 and 1910, respectively). By the early 1910s, all CESEE countries had adopted the gold standard (Morys, 2017). Adopting the gold standard was only one element of a larger reform process in the region (cf. Chapter 4). On some level, the gold standard can even be seen as the final building block, which explains why the actual adoption came so late in CESEE but was then condensed into a 20-year window for all six countries. As with trade and labor flows, attracting foreign capital built upon domestic market development – financial in this case – and improved institutions and state capacity (Crisp, 1976; Good, 1984; South-Eastern, 2014). Governments developed modern finance ministries and central banks, which in turn fostered connections with Western banks and governments. At the same time, countries in the region established and reformed their banking systems by expanding state-owned institutions, chartering commercial banks, and permitting foreign banks to provide capital and guidance to domestic intermediaries.7 Stock exchanges emerged or expanded in


Economic integration with Western Europe 115
Imperial Russia (St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kiev, Kharkov, Odessa, Riga, and Warsaw), Austria-Hungary (Vienna and Budapest), the Ottoman Empire (Istanbul, Salonica), and, eventually, the Balkans (Athens, Belgrade, Bucharest, Sofia and Zagreb).8 By the last decades of the period, the developing CESEE and established Western financial systems were increasingly interconnected in ways that facilitated the flow of capital eastward. The increasing degree of integration has also been assessed quantitatively. Borodkin and Konovalova (2010) find Russian stocks traded at essentially identical prices on domestic and Western European exchanges (Brussels, Berlin, and Paris) in the last two decades of our period, suggesting that equity markets were highly integrated. The evidence compiled by Tilly (1994) on the co-movement of CESEE stock prices traded on German exchanges has similar implications. In this line of research, prices for one and the same security are compared across space, as previously existing arbitrage opportunities between stock exchanges were eliminated by telegraph and telephone (just like in other parts of the world). A different – and more pessimistic – perspective on capital market integration is provided by econometric research comparing key interest rates across countries (or other country-specific indicators such as returns on corporate securities). While such research typically finds convergence over time for the late 19th century (Flandreau and Zumer, 2004; Morys, 2013; South-Eastern, 2014, there were persistent rate differences between CESEE and the rest of Europe. For instance, both shortterm and long-term interest rates came down substantially in CESEE between 1870 and 1914, in line with global and pan-European trends. Yet even at the end of the period, both indicators remain substantially elevated compared not only to the core countries but also to Mediterranean and Nordic countries. The high interest rates charged to the CESEE governments point to deeper institutional problems of the CESEE economies. Even if Russia, Hungary, and Romania retained an uncheckered record of debt payments, they were seen as less trustworthy borrowers by international financial markets; only Austria (which issued its debt separate from Hungary) escaped the “regional surcharge”. Capital market integration helped reduce this problem but could not overcome it. On some level, the high interest rate environment even demonstrated to the outside world that the CESEE economies operated very differently from the rest of Europe. Moreover, in documenting the various ways that the CESEE accessed foreign capital markets over the long 19th century, it is clear that some national sovereignty was transferred to outside powers. The establishment of foreign financial supervision in four out of the seven countries studied here represents particularly tangible cases; yet the detailed analysis of foreign lending into CESEE by Feis (1930) is full of examples where lenders attempted to gain economic, political, or even military advantage from the receiving country. Some have even argued that the CESEE’s experience fit into the continuum of “colonialism” imposed by European powers on much of the rest of the world, with demands made upon governments and populations in return for access to credit. These may have been reasonable calls for capacity building, policy clarity, and modernizing reforms, but the degree of


116 Steven Nafziger and Matthias Morys
foreign involvement in several of the CESEE economies by the early 20th century – particularly Imperial Russia (Malik, 2018) and the Balkan states (Tooze and Ivanov, 2011) – arguably led to heated domestic debates and contributed to the build-up of tensions prior to World War I.
Labor flows
Labor migration was another important linkage between CESEE, Western Europe, and the rest of the global economy. The international mobility of labor emerged relatively late, growing out of the slow integration of domestic markets. In conjunction with trade and capital flows, these population movements further connected the low-income economies of CESEE with more advanced ones. At the same time, several smaller, reverse migratory flows over the long 19th century entailed the transfer of human capital and productive knowledge eastward. However, in the aggregate, international labor migration took place alongside limited convergence in wages or incomes to Western levels. Prior to the 19th century, political conflict, religious strife, and a long history of porous and shifting borders, combined with active settlement policies by various Russian and Austrian rulers, generated a greater degree of ethnic, linguistic, and religious diversity in CESEE relative to anywhere in Western Europe. The early modern period saw the slow movement of Jews eastward into what became the Pale of Settlement; the intermingling of Polish, Ukrainian, Belarusian and Russian populations over much of what is now modern Poland, Ukraine and Belarus; the spread of the Ottoman military and administrators into the Balkans; and the rise of Greek merchant communities throughout the Eastern Mediterranean and Black Sea. Russian settlement also spread eastward into Siberia and Central Asia, while German-speaking colonists moved into the Balkans and southern Russian territories. Many of these movements took place under imperial expansionist or semi-colonial policies (Bartlett, 1979). This heterogeneity did not in itself constitute “labour mobility”, yet it became an important factor in how labour mobility unfolded during the long 19th century. In fact, labor markets were poorly integrated before the 19th century by all accounts. The late spread of steam and rail lines in the context of poor road networks kept travel costs relatively high. The long life of the second serfdom, coupled with the persistence of other, quasi-feudal or ethnic restrictions on occupational and residential choice, generated considerable constraints on the mobility of workers and households. Labor market interactions were local, and long-distance migration out of CESEE was confined to the last three or four decades before World War I. An important step was the eventual end to serfdom which, for the entirety of their territories, was achieved only in 1848 for Austria-Hungary, 1861 in the Russian Empire, and 1864 in Romania (the other Balkan countries experienced less formalized forms of labor coercion). Yet constraints on peasant and worker mobility often persisted into the 20th century (Blum, 1978; Niederhauser, [1962]


Economic integration with Western Europe 117
2004), and ethnic, religious, and linguistic divisions continued to generate impediments to mobility. Restrictions in land markets – such as peasant communal property rights – were prevalent and impeded mobility out of agriculture (for Russian examples, see Chernina et al., 2014). Travel passports, urban residency permits, occupational restrictions, and explicit legal prohibitions on where certain groups were allowed to live (most obviously for Russian Jews in the Pale of Settlement and the Roma throughout the region) were common in Eastern Europe. Yet despite these significant labor market impediments, intra-regional mobility in CESEE became more evident over the 19th century, especially as transportation improved. Studies such as Borodkin et al. (2008), Crisp (1978), and Nafziger (2010) have argued that there was substantial rural-urban and inter-regional labor mobility within European Russia in the latter half of the 19th century (although this did not necessarily lead to much within-country wage convergence). Permanent migration within the empire also entailed growing urbanization, which was particularly prominent among Jews within and outside the Pale of Settlement, setting the stage for emigration (Boustan, 2007). Russian settlers and labourers continued to move east, southeast, and south into Central Asia, the Caucasus, and southern parts of what is now the Ukraine. This process was fueled by the expansion of the railway network, particularly with the construction of various components of the TransSiberian railroad, connections to the Caucasus, and the growing density of the network in European Russia (Kessler, 2014).9 The latter decades of the long 19th century saw growing numbers of seasonal migrants from the Balkans, Austria-Hungary, and the Polish and Ukrainian provinces of the Russian Empire move further north and westward. This was largely seasonal agricultural migration, particularly to parts of Germany, Denmark, and Southern Sweden. By the early 20th century, hundreds of thousands of Austrians, Galicians, Czechs, Poles, Hungarians, Ukrainians, Russians, and other groups were moving every year (Olsson, 1996; Willcox, ed., 1929–1931). Olsson (1996) argues that this short-term migration was part of a very competitive cross-border market for agricultural labor that stretched from Russia west into Germany and beyond. Eventually, migrants increasingly turned to more permanent moves (and into industrial occupations), as economic growth in the West raised the demand for labor across sectors. Western European censuses of the 1900s and 1910s show perhaps a million people born in parts of CESEE, although such an impressionistic number should be interpreted with caution.10 Overall, these flows not only acted to slowly knit the labor markets of CESEE with the rest of Europe, but they served as an initial step towards longer distance, intercontinental moves. CESEE was eventually a major participant in the large-scale international flows of the “Age of Mass Migration” (Hatton and Williamson, 1998).11 Such migration from Austria-Hungary and Russia (and the Polish parts of both empires in particular) annually numbered in the low thousands into the 1870s, but then took off over the following four decades, especially after 1890. According to these totals, gross emigration was over 4 and 3 million from the Austro-Hungarian and Russian Empires, respectively, between 1870 and 1914. From the SEE countries, only


118 Steven Nafziger and Matthias Morys
Mediterranean Greece took part in the Age of Mass Migration. Starting late in the 1890s, approximately 400,000 had emigrated overseas by World War I. As a percent of the resident population, this made Greece (with a population of 4.8 million in 1913) one of the largest participants in overseas migration in Europe, alongside Ireland, Norway, and Italy (Hatton and Williamson, 1998). By contrast, landlocked Serbia as well as Bulgaria and Romania – both facing the Black Sea but with inadequate ports – hardly took part in intercontinental migration (Brunnbauer, 2016; Ivanov and Tooze, 2007; Kabuzan, 1998). The eventual scale of outflows was likely linked to relatively high rates of population growth in the region, coupled with slowly rising incomes, a fall in the costs of migration as chain migration took hold, and persistently high labor demand in recipient countries (Boustan, 2007; Hatton and Williamson, 1998). Precise numbers are controversial, but the broad pattern is well documented and beyond doubt. Last but not least, a considerable proportion of emigrants – perhaps up to one-third (Bandiera et al., 2013; Morys, 2006) returned to CESEE, typically after staying overseas for periods ranging from one season to five years. This suggests a fairly high degree of labor market integration between CESEE and the rest of the world by the onset of the 20th century. A considerable number of the wave of CESEE emigrants after 1870 were Jews up to 1.5 million from the Russian Empire alone (i.e. 50% of total Russian overseas emigration, cf. above).12 While sparked, in part, by discriminatory policies and pogroms, these migrants were also seeking out better economic opportunities abroad, with the magnitude of emigrant flows linked to the business cycle in the United States (Boustan, 2007; Spitzer, 2015). As with streams of emigrants from Western Europe and other parts of CESEE, Jewish migrants moved within chained networks, with communities abroad aiding and informing those that came later. This lowered the costs of migration, which helped integrate Jews from CESEE into global labor markets. What were the economic consequences of migration between CESEE and the rest of the world? Unfortunately, there is little econometric work comparable to the studies of Hatton and Williamson (1998) on Western Europe and intercontinental migration. If emigrants were relatively more positively selected than the streams from Western and Northern Europe, this may have generated some amount of brain drain, reducing the effective level of human capital in CESEE and impeding productivity growth. Hard evidence on this point is, unfortunately, lacking, although country-specific accounts in the Willcox compilation emphasize that most migrants had agricultural roots, despite ongoing urbanization in the region. On the other hand, some of the likely gains received by migrants were returned back to the region in the form of remittances (or as the savings of returned migrants). Based, among others, on the experience of Austria-Hungary between 1880 and 1913, Esteves and Khoudour-Casteras (2009) show that such migrant remittances were key in enabling current account adjustments under the gold standard, which limited the occurrence and costs of sudden stops in capital flows. Such streams were typically less volatile than capital inflows, which could have ameliorated some of the instability inherent in the large-scale foreign investments

in the region. A complete assessment of how CESEE was affected by the first wave of globalization should consider the likely intertwining of labor and capital flows. Perhaps the most telling indicator of the net effect of the migration of labor out of the CESEE is the pace and scale of real wage convergence. In the case of better researched emigration countries such as Ireland and Sweden (Hatton and Williamson, 1998), studies have found strong wage convergence (i.e. that wages declined in the receiving country but rose in the sending country). Yet Chapter 3 of this volume shows that convergence was limited even in the late 19th century and remained confined to a small set of CESEE countries. Taking all the evidence together, the (highly limited) state of research suggests that CESEE benefited less from the Age of Mass Migration than the better researched cases of Western Europe and Italy.
Conclusion
The evidence on factor and trade flows during the long 19th century suggests a slow but persistent process of economic integration between CESEE, Western Europe, and the rest of the global economy. While this characterization applies to the entire region, there was a gradient of experiences, from the western parts of the Hapsburg Empire, which were closely connected to the German economy, to the relatively more autarkic areas of the Balkans and eastern parts of European Russia. Transportation improvements, political developments, and macroeconomic policies leveled this gradient over time to some degree, as even peripheral parts of the region came to be connected to the rest of the world economy. In this chapter, we have drawn on trade patterns, capital flows, and labor mobility to substantiate our main point of growing integration over time. Other research points to the same conclusion; for instance, recent work on business cycles in South-East Europe suggests that the constituent economies were increasingly synchronized with those of Western Europe (Morys and Ivanov, 2015). Yet it is far from clear whether these new levels of economic integration generated extra income gains for the average resident of the region. While the forces of integration might not have resulted in measurable economic improvements for many, the experience of globalization did lead to gains for some sub-regions, sectors, and capital owners in CESEE. Emigration and internal labor mobility led to better economic outcomes for those able to move, with some positive consequences for stayers in terms of remittances and the reduction of subsequent migration costs. Underpinned by improving macroeconomic policymaking in the gold standard era, trade in capital goods, FDI, and portfolio investment generated flows of technological knowledge that improved agricultural productivity, enabled transportation development, and supported some industrial growth in the region to take advantage of overall low labor costs. As summarized in the chapters of O’Rourke and Williamson (2017), the last decades of this period did see the early stages of modern industrial development in the region, a process that was firmly linked to the influx of foreign capital and technology.


120 Steven Nafziger and Matthias Morys
At the same time, the region remained, with the possible exception of Austria, comprised of “emerging markets,” in which trade, capital flows, and labor migration generated both positive and negative effects. Trade openness fostered de-industrialization in some areas, while capital flows were volatile and led to factor payments going abroad. The loss of substantial human capital (even if negatively selected) over the period limited the overall welfare benefits of CESEE’s integration with the global economy. And while this chapter has compartmentalized three different aspects of globalization as applied to CESEE, the flows of trade, capital, and labor were intertwined in complicated ways, with various political economy implications. Thus, the net effects of 19th-century globalization for the region remain hard to identify, particularly if consequences that are more difficult to quantify are included – such as cultural and intellectual linkages, knowledge flows, health and demographic effects, and potential risk for military and political conflict. While the processes remained incomplete by 1914, growing tensions among the CESEE countries, and between the CESEE countries and the Western European powers, were to some degree an outcome of the long-run factor and trade relations between them. France’s vast capital investments into Russia, for instance, underpinned the emerging political and military alliance between the two countries. Simmering conflicts culminated in World War I, which brought CESEE into the heart of European and global politics. The war led to a fundamental reordering of the connections that had developed between Russia and the rest of the world, the end of any meaningful Ottoman influence in southeastern Europe, and the emergence and consolidation of new nation-states in the Baltics, the former Hapsburg lands, and the Balkans. Restructured trade, capital, and labor flows slowly re-linked much of the region to the outside world in the interwar period, even as the Soviet Union shifted towards relative autarky. The subsequent consolidation of Communist control of the Eastern Bloc, the formation of COMECON, and the development of Soviet economic relations with friendly regimes reconfigured but never entirely eliminated the connections between the CESEE and the wider world created over the long 19th century.
Notes
1 There were minor Russian investments in Finland, East Asia, and the Middle East, along with some limited involvement of Austrian firms in Western Europe. 2 Cf. the data descriptions of the four contributions we rely on for Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, and Serbia as well as Feis (1930, Ch. 12). Reinhart and Trebesch (2015), based on different sources, come to the same result for the case of Greece. 3 See Lampe and Jackson (1982) and Geyikdagi (2011) for a discussion of the role of foreign capital in the construction of railroads in the Balkans and Ottoman Empire, respectively. 4 The early Balkan banks were especially dominated by Western European capital, particularly French, German, and Austro-Hungarian (Kostis, ed., 1999; Tilly, 1994). For foreign – particularly French and German – involvement in Russian banking, see Anan’ich and Bovykin (1991), Crisp (1976), and Hertner (1997). On the role played by banks in linking foreign savings to domestic investments in the Ottoman Empire, see Geyikdagi (2011) and Thobie (2008).

5 French investments in Russia can be disaggregated easily into investments into governments bonds and investments into private securities. For all other countries, we have data only for the latter. These data suggest that by World War I, French investment in Russian private capital was roughly two times the German and over 20% more than the British (Ol’, 1922, p. 301). 6 In other studies, the importance of Russia for French foreign investment portfolios looms even larger – see Crisp (1976). 7 The relevant literatures on banking history in CESEE are quite large. Useful summaries may be found in Crisp (1976), Lampe and Jackson (1982), Kostis, ed. (1999), and the chapters on Serbia and Austria in Cameron, ed. (1972). On the international connections of CESEE banking in the pre-1914 period, see the chapters in Cameron and Bovykin, eds. (1991) and Kostis, ed. (1999). 8 On the establishment and expansion of domestic financial markets in CESEE, see Borodkin and Konovalova (2010), Lampe and Jackson (1982); South-Eastern (2014), and Toprak (2008). 9 There is comparatively little scholarship on internal migration within the Balkans or within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, likely due to the relative lack of quantitative sources. Some limited evidence of fairly small-scale cross-border flows within (e.g. Serbia to Bulgaria) and between these regions is provided in Jackson (1985) and Palairet (1997). 10 Our estimate of “1 million” CESEE-born residents in Western Europe was generated from the relevant chapters of Willcox, ed. (1929–1931). 11 The primary quantitative resource on international migration in this period is Willcox, ed. (1929–1931), which drew on a wealth of national-level statistical materials, departure records from German and other port cities, and immigration reports of the United States and elsewhere. In providing the following quantitative information on aggregate emigration flows from CESEE, we draw on Willcox, ed., cross-checked against a number of the country-specific studies cited here, and validated against the revised numbers published in Carter (2006). In general, these data do not cover the large return population flows back to the region, and they likely miss considerable migration occurring through less visible channels (on these, see Bandiera et al., 2013). 12 According to Tudorianu (1986), 41% of the 2.4 million migrants from the Russian Empire between 1899 and 1913 were Jews, while 29% were officially Polish (these may also have included Jews to some degree).
