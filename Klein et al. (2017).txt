4 How Peripheral was the Periphery? Industrialization in East Central Europe since 1870 
Alexander Klein, Max-Stephan Schulze, Tamás Vonyó
This chapter explores the timing, pace, and spatial di usion of modern industry in the former
Habsburg Empire and its successor states. The regions adjacent to Western Europe, Alpine Austria, and
the Czech lands shifted from proto-industrial to modern manufacturing rst, followed by the western
parts of Hungary. Though well advanced in the western and northwestern regions, industry di used
only slowly to the east and southeast, with profound implications for East Central European economies
throughout the twentieth century. It is argued that this part of Europe stepped into the industrial age
before most of the global periphery; that economic growth was mainly driven by industry from the late
nineteenth century to the collapse of state socialism; and that the contribution of industry to aggregate
value added was associated with a growing share of ‘modern’ manufacturing in industrial production.
However, post-war interventionist policies failed to erase relative backwardness in East Central
Europe.
4.1 Introduction
The origins of industrialization in Central and East Central Europe reach back into the eighteenth century
(Good, 1984; Komlos 1983, 1989). Much of this part of Europe was under Habsburg rule until the demise of
the Austro-Hungarian Empire at the end of the First World War. The Habsburg realm’s geographical
location at the crossroads of Europe’s west and east meant that the timing and spatial di usion of
industrialization mirrored the broader European experience. It was in the regions adjacent to western

Europe, Alpine Austria and the Czech lands that ‘the growth impulses from England and of the continental
northwest found fertile ground rst’ (Good, 1984, p. 15), and where the shift from proto-industrial to
modern forms of manufacturing began in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
By the early 1870s, Austrian industrialization was well beyond the transitional phase that according to
Komlos (1983) lasted to the mid-1820s, and was thus well into the ‘machine-industrial phase’ proper.
However, as elsewhere in Europe, industrialization in the Habsburg lands, its timing and pace, was a
process characterized by pronounced regional di erences (Pollard, 1986). These gaps initially widened over
the course of the nineteenth century, as industrial activity in Alpine Austria and the Czech lands gathered
momentum. The western parts of Hungary followed signi cantly later with a rst wave of industrial
expansion in the late 1860s and early 1870s. Industrialization, though by 1913 well advanced in the western
and northwestern regions of the empire, di used only slowly to its most eastern and southeastern regions.
This had profound implications for the structure and growth of the East Central European economies
throughout the late nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It is the stark unevenness in the extent of
industrial activity across the regions of East Central Europe that prompts the question of how peripheral
this periphery was. We suggest that, at least in a European context, the imaginary line between the ‘core’
and ‘the periphery’ ran through the Habsburg economy—from the west/northwest to the east/southeast,
re ecting the pattern of di usion of modern economic growth emphasized in the historiography (Good,
1984; Pollard, 1986). The empire’s unique position—being both close to and at the same time far away from
the European industrial core—is, on the one hand, demonstrated by its prominent rank among the world’s
leading machinery producers: by 1913, Austria-Hungary’s mechanical engineering industry, located mainly
around Vienna and in the Czech lands, was in terms of output surpassed only by the United States, Britain,
and Germany (Schulze, 1996). Yet, on the other hand, the Habsburg economy included large, populous
regions in the east where industrialization had made little, if any, headway by the time of the First World
War. Galicia, for example, accounted for about 28 per cent of Imperial Austria’s population in 1910, but
contributed less than 6 per cent of manufacturing output.

In the early nineteenth century, the western half of the Habsburg Empire was economically in as promising
a position as the territories of Germany proper (Freudenberger, 2003). Around 1820, per capita GDP was
about 7 per cent higher than in Germany; the comparative income lead was even larger for the regions that
form present-day Austria. That lead, though, was to disappear fast over the following decades. In this
sense, then, the evidence lends some support to Alexander Gerschenkron’s pessimistic assessment of
nineteenth-century Austria as a case of ‘failure’ (Gerschenkron, 1977, p. 54). Table 4.1 reports GDP per
capita for Central Europe, expressed in percentages of the German level. Four initial, general observations
stand out. First, in the late nineteenth century, the Habsburg Empire, especially its Austrian half, became
considerably poorer in terms of per capita income than its newly uni ed German neighbour. To a large
extent, this falling-behind was an outcome of lower output and productivity growth in Cisleithanian
industry which, in turn, was linked to signi cantly lower levels of human capital than in Germany (Schulze,
2007a). Second, for the late nineteenth century, there is a large development gap between Imperial Austria
and Imperial Hungary (in pre-1918 borders) on the one hand, and the empire’s economically most advanced
regions located in what today constitute Austria and the Czech Republic, on the other. This is a re ection of
the comparatively late onset of industrialization in Hungary and the eastern regions of the empire. Third,
there is some evidence of modest intra-empire catching-up before 1914: the income gap between
Cisleithania and Transleithania declined and so did the di erentials between the territories of modern
Austria, Czechoslovakia, and Hungary. Fourth, over the long run there is a remarkable absence of signi cant
changes in the relative levels of economic development within the broader region that we study,
including Poland for comparison. Though her initial income lead turned into a lag between 1870 and 1913,
Austria was broadly on a par in level terms with the German economy (in its 1990 borders) throughout most
of the modern era, with the notable exception of the disastrous episode of the 1930s. The East Central
European economies, on the other hand, lagged behind both Germany and Austria and, although the size of
this developmental gap did not remain constant over time, it is today astonishingly similar to what it was
more than a hundred years ago.

If there is one message to take away from studying the economic history of East Central Europe in the era of
modern economic growth, then it is this absence of cross-country convergence in levels of economic
development over the long run. East Central Europe had begun to industrialize before the rest of the global
periphery, and thus it is better described as ‘half-periphery’. However, it has remained a half-periphery and
has failed to catch up to, or even signi cantly narrow the gap vis-à-vis, the European core of advanced
economies. East Central Europe thus failed to take advantage of its relative economic backwardness
(Gerschenkron, 1962) and to exploit its catch-up potential (Abramovitz, 1986). After the collapse of the
Soviet bloc and the following sharp depression that lasted into the mid-1990s, the income gap began to
decline gradually, but so far this convergence has only just su ced to make up for the ground lost during
the socialist era.
While some of the general patterns we describe prevailed in the wider region of East Central Europe, the
geographical focus is limited to the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy and its three main successor states, whose
post-1918 territory remained entirely within the borders of the Habsburg Empire. The aim here is to
quantify the level, structure, and trajectory of industrial development between 1870 and 2005 within, as far
as possible, the borders of current-day Austria, Hungary, and the Czech and Slovak Republics. The latter two
will be referred to, for the most part, as Czechoslovakia. Throughout the chapter, industry is de ned as the
sum of mining, manufacturing, and public utilities, except when otherwise stated. For the inter-war period,
in particular, currently available data do not allow us to separate manufacturing from the rest of the
industrial sector. For the years between 1950 and 1989, substantial di erences in industry classi cation
between the three countries make such distinction similarly di cult. However, it is not just classi cation
issues that pose a problem when it comes to setting out long-term patterns of industrial development: state
borders changed after the First World War and with the formation of the three main successor states. In
most cases, the new state-level borders were not drawn along pre-war region boundaries that typically
identify the contemporary statistical units of observation.
p. 66
Quantitatively, we have three speci c aims. First, we present near-complete time series on industrial
production and compare them to the growth of gross domestic product (GDP). Second, we account for the
level of industrialization by establishing the share of industry and other major sectors of economic activity
in the labour force. Third, we gather evidence on the changing composition of industrial output to show how
the role of modern manufacturing industries evolved over time. In this third task, we have to rely on data
not entirely consistent between the pre-1914, inter-war, and post-1950 periods. This limitation is
determined by post-1918 border changes, inter-temporal changes in industry classi cations, and, in
general, by the extent to which disaggregated data on industrial production are available. Our discussion of
the evidence is, therefore, structured chronologically focusing on three main periods: 1870–1914, 1920–38,
and 1950–89. In the nal section we brie y consider the years following the fall of Communism and draw
general conclusions about the achievements of industrialization in East Central Europe.

4.2 Industrialization in the Habsburg Empire: Di usion and Concentration in the Late Nineteenth Century
The process of industrialization in the Habsburg lands after 1870 evolved within the context of an empire
wide customs and monetary union and against the background of the 1867 constitutional settlement that
established the Dual Monarchy. An increasingly dense railway network connected the regional centres of
economic activity, stretching from the empire’s western border with Switzerland to its eastern border with
Russia, and from its northern border with Germany to the Mediterranean. The sheer geographical expanse
of the empire brought with it a large degree of regional di erence in broadly conceived resource
endowments and in access to both domestic and foreign markets. These di erences had a major impact on
the location of industry and manufacturing in the empire and, by extension, its successor states. The
broader outlines of the spatial pattern of industrial activity that came to characterize the second half of the
nineteenth century emerged over the previous hundred years or so. Four factors, in particular, shaped this
regional pattern and its concomitant di erentials in manufacturing activity. First, the western and
northwestern regions of the empire, i.e. those broadly corresponding with the territories of modern Austria
and the Czech Republic, experienced the weakening of feudal institutions earlier than the more eastern
regions, creating room for the rise of non-agricultural activity. It was here that domestic industry took hold
rst, that an entrepreneurial class emerged comparatively early, that foreign capital and expertise was
attracted to, and where, eventually, modern forms of manufacturing began to develop (Good, 1984, pp. 14
24). In 1790, 280 manufacturing rms were counted in the empire (excluding Galicia, Vorarlberg, and
Tyrol). Of these, 50 per cent were located in Lower Austria and 30 per cent in Bohemia (ibid.)
foreshadowing the two regions’ pre-eminence in Austro-Hungarian manufacturing through to 1914,
notwithstanding the changing composition of regional output over time. Second, at the time of initial
industrialization the western and northwestern regions of the empire were already signi cantly more
urbanized than the rest of the country (ibid.), entailing agglomeration economies that were to intensify over
the course of the nineteenth century. Third, by 1870 the Alpine and Czech lands had a huge lead in the stock
of human capital, built up over the preceding decades: new estimates suggest that the di erence in average
years of schooling compared to the least advanced regions in the empire was equivalent to about two and a
half years, or 60 (75) per cent of the average years of schooling for Imperial Austria (Hungary) as a whole.
Finally, access to domestic and foreign purchasing power was crucial for the development of
manufacturing, and in this respect, too, industry in Alpine Austria and the Czech lands held an advantage
over the more remote regions in the empire’s east.

Manufacturing in both halves of the empire expanded at signi cantly higher rates than the aggregate
economy. Table 4.2 shows that by 1913, almost one-quarter of Imperial Austria’s GDP was generated in
manufacturing, while in Imperial Hungary the proportion more than doubled from less than 7 per cent in
1870 to 14 per cent in 1913. This rise in manufacturing’s relative importance was the outcome of an uneven
process of accelerations and decelerations in industrial activity and investment as well as changes in the
output composition broadly in favour of ‘modern’ sectors such as metal-making, engineering, and (petro-)
chemicals. Between 1870 and 1913, manufacturing output in Austria grew by about 2.3 per cent per
annum compared with 4.0 per cent for the much less industrialized Hungary. Yet the growth rates of
manufacturing (or, more broadly, industrial) output in Austria and Hungary were out of phase with one
another over the period (Table 4.3): this had to do with the e ects of the 1873 Vienna stock market crash.
The crash led to an out ow of Austrian capital to Hungary and was a key factor in prolonging sluggish
growth in Austria whilst stimulating the rst major wave of industrialization in the Hungarian lands
(Komlos, 1983). The repatriation of capital to Austria in the early 1890s sustained the resumption of
manufacturing and aggregate growth there and was associated with a slowdown in the Hungarian half of
the empire. This pattern of deceleration and acceleration was closely associated with changes in investment
demand for plant and equipment, which are apparent in the temporal evolution of domestic machinery
output and changes in the gross stock of machinery (Schulze, 1997, 2007a).

The pre-1873 upswing in Habsburg manufacturing was fuelled by an expansion in the money supply to
nance the wars with Prussia and Italy and a record Hungarian harvest in 1867/8 coming at a time of poor
harvests elsewhere in Europe (Matis, 1972, pp. 153–61). Buoyant cereal and our exports initiated a
dramatic expansion in the empire’s railway network, providing a major stimulus to the domestic producer
and capital goods industries that had developed in the western and northwestern regions since the late
eighteenth century. These industries—engineering and iron and steel, in particular—were located primarily
in Alpine Austria and the Czech lands. As rural incomes rose in response to increasing grain and land prices,
demand for consumer goods expanded and led to the installation of new productive capacity in
manufacturing. The associated growth in empire-wide demand for machinery provided a llip not just to
Austrian producers but also to Budapest’s nascent engineering industry.

Austrian manufacturing output peaked in 1871. Yet what started out as the downswing following the
expansionary phase of a regular business cycle was transformed into a major recession in industry by the
impact of the 1873 crash, which changed longer-term expectations and investment decisions. From the late
1870s Austrian investors, seeking safe assets, engaged in large-scale purchases of new Hungarian debt. The
Hungarian government was thus able to nance its regular expenditure and investment in infrastructure
without crowding out private domestic investors (as much of the new debt was held in Austria). Further, the
growth in Hungarian disposable incomes and in consumer demand was not constrained as the government
was able to meet its scal targets without recourse to excessive taxation. This provided a major stimulus to
both consumer and capital goods producers in a still largely agricultural economy. Hence, in Hungary the
signs of depression were almost absent (despite a modest dip in activity in the 1870s). In Austria, though,
the e ects were rather di erent: ‘the diminished stock of venture capital had a negative impact on
industrial production until the 1890s. By attracting large amounts of Austrian capital, the Hungarian
economy was therefore in uential in prolonging the depression in Austria’ (Komlos, 1983, p. 218). The
overall outcome was a painfully sluggish recovery in Austrian manufacturing from the 1873 trough through
to the mid-1880s and rapid expansion in Hungarian manufacturing into the late 1880s and early 1890s
(Schulze, 2000).
7
As domestic demand began to pick up again in the second half of the 1880s, Austrian industrialists started
installing new capacity again, going beyond mere replacement investment which had been characteristic of
the preceding decade and a half. The beginning of this upturn in the late 1880s and early 1890s coincided
with the reversal of intra-empire capital ows. Austrian investors turned to domestic industrial equity
again (Somary, 1902, Table II, p. 39) and investment in industrial machinery was aided by a fall in Austrian
long-term interest rates (Schulze, 1997). While the repatriation of Austrian capital was associated with a
signi cant increase in Austrian manufacturing (GDP) growth of about 1.5 (1.1) percentage points over 1871
95, Hungary ‘su ered less’ than ‘Austria gained’: growth in manufacturing declined by less than 1
percentage point and the observed decrease in GDP growth is probably within the margin of error (0.2
percentage points). We hypothesize that this had to do with, rst, a much deeper and more sophisticated
Hungarian domestic capital market than there had been in the early 1870s, as a result of signi cantly higher
per capita incomes after more than twenty years of relatively fast economic growth; second, a shift into
higher value-added manufacturing branches; and, third, comparatively high productivity growth in
agriculture that sustained disposable income growth and demand for manufactured goods in a still largely
agricultural economy. Throughout the late nineteenth century, agriculture in Hungary had a substantial
revealed comparative advantage in crop production. The sector bene ted from ready access to the higher
income markets in Austria that were largely uncontested by foreign importers due to the Habsburg customs
union’s external tari (Katus, 1970; Komlos, 1983). In addition, not only did crop production lend itself
more readily to mechanization and machinery investment in Hungary than in most parts of the overall more
mountainous and rugged Austria, but Hungary ran a trade surplus in both crops and livestock products with
her customs union partner (Eddie, 1989).

While textiles and iron were at the centre of early industrialization in the Alpine and Czech lands, the
process of industrialization in Hungary was driven initially by the agricultural processing industries,
especially our milling (Good, 1984, pp. 125–48), which drew on a productive domestic rural sector as the
main source of its inputs. Yet the structure of manufacturing changed signi cantly in the later decades of
the century in both parts of the empire and became more diversi ed. This raises the question of to what
extent shifts to ‘modern’ industries were associated with changes in overall manufacturing growth. Here we
consider iron and steel production, engineering (including mechanical and electrical engineering as well as
transport equipment) and chemicals as representative of the ‘modern sector’. Of course, this is a
simpli cation—technical change, product and process innovations occurred in other sectors, too. Table 4.4
sets out the comparative growth rates and the relative contributions to manufacturing growth made by the
‘modern sector’ compared to other manufacturing branches. Three observations can be made. First, the
‘modern sector’ grew signi cantly faster than the rest of manufacturing in both Austria and Hungary.
Second, this held over both periods under review. Third, the evidence for Austria-Hungary conforms
broadly with the general nding that industrialization typically involved a growing share not only of
manufacturing in aggregate output, but also of a rising weight of the ‘modern sectors’ in manufacturing as
a whole. In Austria, the proportion of manufacturing growth attributable to the rise of the ‘modern sectors’
went up from less than 23 per cent (1871–95) to almost 40 per cent at a time of overall accelerating
manufacturing growth. For Hungary, the corresponding gures are 17 per cent and 25 per cent, re ecting
the overall less advanced state and structure of manufacturing in Transleithania.

Table 4.5 reveals some key structural characteristics of the Habsburg economy. First, throughout the period
under review the empire as a whole remained a largely agricultural economy, especially so in its eastern,
Hungarian half. In comparison, less than half of the labour force in Germany was employed in agriculture in
1871 and by 1910 this proportion had fallen to less than 36 per cent, while manufacturing’s share had risen
to more than 29 per cent (Ho mann, 1965). Note, however, that Imperial Austria had a signi cantly
higher share of manufacturing (or, more broadly, industrial) employment in 1870 than its southern
neighbour Italy and maintained a slight lead until the First World War (cf. Chapter 6, Table 6.2). Second,
the picture looks distinctly di erent if the focus is on those territories that after the First World War became
parts of either the Austrian Republic or Czechoslovakia. Here the shares of industry and manufacturing in
total employment were far higher than on average across the empire, on a par with those prevalent in
Germany and well above the corresponding gures for Italy. These data, then, con rm the notion of the
Alpine and Czech regions as the industrial heartlands of the empire and as regions of industrial activity
close to the European core.

The level di erences in manufacturing and industrial employment shares within Austria-Hungary re ect
the regional di erentials in the timing and sectoral basis of industrialization across the empire. Hungary
—whether in its imperial or modern guise—came late to the game. Here, industrialization in earnest had
started only during the 1860s and 1870s, aided by the in ow of Austrian funds after the 1873 stock market
crash. Budapest (in the central Danube–Tisza Basin), in particular, but also the Hungarian regions on the
Danube Left and Right Banks as well as the Tisza Right Bank became progressively more engaged in
manufacturing over time. However, compared to Austria or Czechoslovakia, and even Imperial Austria as a
whole, manufacturing played a markedly less prominent role in the Hungarian economy right up to the First
World War. This is borne out by the evidence on both regional shares in manufacturing output and regional
manufacturing output per head (Table 4.6).

Clearly, the spatial distribution of manufacturing across the Habsburg Empire changed over time, broadly in
line with the gradual intra-empire catching-up of the Hungarian on the Austrian economy. By 1910,
Budapest was rmly on the map as a major manufacturing location. Yet just as striking as this is
persistence: in terms of manufacturing output per capita, the most industrialized regions in 1910 were still,
by a large margin, Lower Austria and the Czech lands—just as they had been forty years earlier. In absolute
terms, the per capita output lead of the established manufacturing regions over the others increased, even if
it had marginally declined in percentage terms. Following New Economic Geography reasoning, regions’
access to domestic and foreign markets (here: transport and tari -cost weighted GDPs of main trading
partners) is a central candidate factor accounting for a good deal of inter-regional di erences in
manufacturing activity. Habsburg regions’ manufacturing output per head over 1870 to 1910 is indeed
strongly associated with access to the home and European markets. Further, regional di erences in
human capital endowments (average years of schooling) are strongly associated with regional di erences in
manufacturing output per head. The critical issue here is the interaction between the two. The evidence
suggests that those regions that were comparatively well endowed with human capital were in a
signi cantly better position to exploit their market potential, i.e. to realize bene ts of economies of scale
and specialization related to market size. The regions in the landlocked and remote east of the empire (e.g.
Galicia, the Bukovina or Transylvania) were not only disadvantaged in terms of their limited access to
Habsburg or foreign markets, but also constrained by previous generations’ lack of investment in schooling.
The southern coastal regions had a large market potential because of their cost advantages of sea
transportation to growing foreign markets but, in the case of Dalmatia or Croatia–Slavonia, su ered from a
poorly educated labour force. There was, then, little incentive for manufacturers to locate in these regions
despite their favourable position in terms of market access. Where the human capital stock was higher, the
response to the opportunities a orded by better market access was stronger, as demonstrated by the
region around Trieste (Littoral). Although enrolment rates rose faster in the least developed parts of the
empire than in the more advanced regions (where levels were, by Habsburg standards, already relatively
high), it took considerable time before this fed into increases in average years of schooling. Those parts of
the Habsburg Empire that were characterized by initially high levels of schooling, Alpine Austria and the
Czech lands, were still well in the lead by 1910. Stark inter-regional di erences in education investment
prior to the 1870s had a lasting impact on regions’ relative performance in manufacturing up to the First
World War.

4.3 Industrialization on Hold: Central Europe Between the Wars
If John Maynard Keynes was correct in arguing that the economic consequences of the peace after the First
World War were detrimental for Germany, then their impact beyond Germany’s eastern borders can be
branded catastrophic. Unlike the territory of post-war Poland, Austria, Czechoslovakia and Hungary
witnessed little, if any, destruction due to war activity. The only exception is the brief con ict between the
short-lived Bolshevik regime in Hungary and the Petite Entente formed by Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and
Romania, that ended with the Romanian occupation of most of Hungary in 1920. Still, the post-war
settlement dislocated the economies of Central Europe. The dissolution of the Habsburg Empire severely
limited access to markets and resources for industrial rms both within and beyond the pre-1914 borders
(Teichova, 1985, pp. 223–7).

Di erent regions of the empire di ered not only in their level of industrialization, but also in what branches
of manufacturing they had specialized in. Thus the new borders, coupled with the animosity of the new
nation states towards their neighbours, implied much-reduced market potential for many industries and
the breakdown of crucial input–output linkages between rms. The milling industry of Budapest, the textile
and clothing industry in Austria, or machine-tool producers in Bohemia and Moravia not only faced
di culties in accessing their once most important markets, but also in securing necessary intermediate
inputs. While recent research has revealed that the negative impact of economic nationalism on market
integration was already felt before the First World War, it became devastating after 1918 (Schulze and Wolf,
2011, pp. 652–73). As shown in Table A.4.2 in the appendix, the decline in industrial output across the war
was comparable to, and in the case of Austria was even greater than, that of GDP—in a period when the rate
of industrialization was on the rise in rest of the global periphery.
Between the wars, industrial expansion was very moderate in Central Europe, following a path quite similar
to that of Germany and most of the advanced Western economies. Following a relatively successful
stabilization that brought an end to hyperin ation in Austria and Hungary and restored state nances by
1924, all three countries recovered quickly up until 1929. Industrial production grew by 4.5 per cent annually
in Austria, and by 8 per cent in Czechoslovakia and Hungary. However, approximately half of this growth
was lost during the Great Depression, which in both Austria and Czechoslovakia a ected the manufacturing
sector more strongly than the rest of the economy. In both countries, political forces prolonged the slump.
While extreme political fractionalization leading to civil war tormented Austria, the government in Prague
tried policies of import substitution while maintaining the gold standard, which continued to have a
de ationary e ect until the mid-1930s. Furthermore, the export-oriented nature of Czech industry, and its
relative success during the 1920s in replacing exports to the former empire with exports to other markets,
made it more susceptible to international trade shocks (Drabek, 1985, pp. 408, 429–30). Czech industry was
hit hard by the rising tari s and administrative trade barriers that emerged across Europe during and after
the Great Depression (Pryor et al., 1971, pp. 35–59; Drabek, 1985, pp. 432–33). As a result, industrial output
remained well below 1929 levels until 1937.
p. 75
Between 1938 and 1943, the expansion of the Nazi war economy gave a large impetus to industrial growth in
Central Europe, particularly in the territories annexed by Hitler in 1938. In the rst two years after the
Anschluss, the Austrian economy grew by more than 30 per cent, and industry by more than a half,
re ecting the priority given to war preparations (Butschek, 1978, p. 65). After the announcement of
rearmament in 1938, Hungary also experienced a growth spurt driven by industrial expansion. While total
employment in the economy remained constant until 1943, it climbed from 330,000 to 451,000 in
manufacturing, leading to a 37 per cent increase in industrial production (Ránki, 1964, p. 225; Berend and
Ránki, 1960, p. 140). Recent research has revealed the staggering growth of German imports from the region
after 1939, with particularly large increases from Austria and the annexed Czech lands (Scherner, 2011, pp.
79–113). Consequently, wartime industrial expansion focused primarily on mining and the primary metal
industries as well as machinery and armaments.
In terms of structural development, the region did not witness much action during the inter-war period.
Industrialization was put on hold; the occupational distribution of the labour force remained almost
unchanged in all three countries, as reported in Table 4.7. The most important factor holding back
structural modernization was the fact that agricultural productivity remained very modest, due to the lack
of technological innovation, the slow spread of chemical fertilizers, and low mechanization. Thus, the
farming sector had only a limited potential to release labour, which was further aggravated by the pro
agrarian political radicalization of the 1930s.

The literature, however, has pointed to several other constraints on industrial expansion. Teichova
emphasized the shortage of skilled labour, which was a crucial factor limiting manufacturing growth in a
period when European industry still relied heavily on craft production methods (Teichova, 1988, pp. 21–2).
Eckstein stressed the decline in capital investment from the pre-1914 period, and more so after 1929, which
increased the technological lag vis-à-vis advanced Western nations (Eckstein, 1955, p. 220). As shown in
Figs 4.1 and 4.2 respectively, without su cient investment in new equipment the main drivers of
technological modernization in the inter-war period, electri cation and motorization, made very little
progress in Central Europe. This relative backwardness was noticeable in comparison not only with the
United States, but also with Germany, and it became more pronounced during the 1930s.

In an environment increasingly characterized by resource scarcity and trade protectionism,
industrialization had several common features across Central Europe: industrial concentration to achieve
economies of scale, cartelization to secure preferential access to markets and foreign technology, and
product specialization to exploit market potential in niche areas. Both in Czechoslovakia and Hungary, the
growth of industrial production was driven by the expansion of large-scale enterprise in primary metals,
chemicals, and engineering. The three largest metallurgical companies in Czechoslovakia increased their
share in steel production from 65 per cent in 1921 to 90 per cent by 1936, and owned all the export quotas
allocated to the country in the International Steel Cartel (Teichova, 1988, pp. 40–1). In Hungary, the leading
rms in the electro-technical industry and railway engineering managed to increase their global market
share despite shrinking domestic demand. They achieved this by integrating into German-led international
cartels and by concentrating on very specialized products, such as lamp and radio parts, or diesel multiple
units used on small railways in remote regions around the world (Hidvégi and Vonyó, 2012, pp. 61–2). By
contrast, the more traditional branches of manufacturing, such as the milling industry in Hungary, or the
sugar industry in Bohemia, faced relative decline. Between 1924 and 1937, the share of metals, chemicals,
and engineering products in total industrial output in Czechoslovakia increased from 22.6 per cent to 31.7
per cent (Teichova, 1988, p. 34). The same level of disaggregation is not possible for Hungary, but the
statistical evidence shows that while the contribution of mining, smelting, handicraft production, and
construction to national product did not change between 1924 and 1938, the share of manufacturing (which
did not
include metallurgy or construction materials) increased from 15.5 per cent to 21.4 per cent (Eckstein, 1955,
p. 171).
p. 77
p. 78
Despite the overall sluggish industrialization of East Central Europe, the region recorded some examples of
the implementation of modern productivity-enhancing technologies, though these were exceptions rather
than the general rule. The best-known case is the Baťa works in Zlín, the leading concern in the
Czechoslovak shoe-making industry. The introduction of advanced American mass production techniques
between 1924 and 1927 achieved a dramatic productivity increase that lasted into the early 1930s. Shoe
production jumped from 8.9 million pairs in 1926 to 15.2 million pairs in 1927, while employment expanded
by ‘only’ 35 per cent in the same year. Between 1930 and 1933, average weekly output per worker increased
from 37 to 48 pairs and Czechoslovakia became one of the world’s leading exporters of footwear (Teichova,
1985, pp. 275–6).

4.4 Planned Industrialization in a State-Managed Economy
If the consequences of the First World War were catastrophic for Central Europe, the impact of the Second
World War was apocalyptic. Hostilities on the eastern front brought unprecedented destruction. The
temporary demise of the German economy and the East–West tensions emerging from the post-war
settlement untied the input–output linkages between the region’s industries. These were still partially the
legacy of industrial development in the Habsburg Empire before 1914, but even more so the product of Nazi
economic imperialism. From the mid-1930s, German foreign policy considered the region as its natural
backwater and increasingly tied its economies to the Third Reich via bilateral trade agreements. The
economic dependence on Germany increased further during the war, especially for the territories
temporarily annexed by the Third Reich. By late 1945, in Austria and Hungary, industrial production
plummeted to levels that had already been surpassed by 1900 (see Tables A4.1 and A4.2 in the appendix).
However, the most detrimental economic outcome of the war was the immense loss it caused in human
resources. Besides the innumerable military and civilian casualties, more than a million Jews who had
resided in the three countries before 1939 perished in the Holocaust. Lastly, one needs to account for the
expulsion of minority Germans from East and Central Europe after 1945, in accordance with the Potsdam
Agreement. Of the 16 million who voluntarily ed or were uprooted between 1944 and 1950, 3 million were
expelled from Czechoslovakia and 210,000 from Hungary. Most of the expellees were deported to post-war
Germany, many dying in the process, and 370,000 settled in Austria (Reichling, 1989, p. 26).
15
While these deportations have featured prominently in the literature on the post-war West German
economy, their impact has been largely ignored in the economic history of Eastern Europe. The combined
e ect of wartime casualties, including the permanently wounded and the mentally debilitated, and the
post-war settlement, was enormous. Austria and Hungary witnessed practically no population growth
between 1939 and 1950. During the same period the population of Czechoslovakia within its post-1945
borders declined from 14.7 million to 12.4 million (Maddison, 2006, pp. 416, 474–5). The Sudetenland was
largely depopulated, and important industrial districts thus lost a vast share of their pre-war labour force.
Across Central Europe, the war had left behind an ill-balanced demographic structure with a notable
shortage of able-bodied young and middle-aged men, who traditionally constituted the backbone of the
industrial workforce. The Holocaust and the expulsion of minority Germans, in particular, together with
substantial emigration among the bourgeois middle class, bequeathed to the tormented nations of Central
Europe a plethora of industrial and commercial assets without owners, and without the necessary skills and
entrepreneurial know-how to operate them.
p. 79
16
To rebuild and re-organize the war-shattered and dislocated economies required state management, which
already materialized under the national-unity governments during the late 1940s, and under Allied military
occupation in Austria. Popular land reforms were followed by large-scale nationalization in industry. By
1948, all large enterprises and most middle-size rms were brought under state control; private property
only continued to prevail in handicraft production. The state-managed economy operated with xed prices
and wages, and the centralized allocation of resources, including both material inputs and investment. Even
in Austria, most assets in heavy industry, public transport, and utilities were publicly owned, and the rest of
the economy was subjected to tremendous red tape. From the immediate post-war years, governments in all
three countries pursued autarkic industrialization policies with extensive planning. While central planning
was never introduced in Austria, she served as the canonical example of a managed mixed economy
(Berend, 1997, pp. 72–82; Seidel, 2005).

In many ways, during the early post-war period Central Europe followed a similar path to that of Latin
American countries during their irtation with import-substituting industrialization. In Austria, multiple
exchange rates and targeted industrial subsidies were used to improve the competitiveness of domestic
manufacturing. Although forced industrialization in socialist command economies applied other tools to
steer economic development that often re ected military-strategic motives, it also aimed at creating
industrial self-su ciency and accelerating the process of structural change. However, from the late 1950s,
industrialization in Central Europe owed much less to the East–West arms race than was the case in the
Soviet Union. According to data published by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI),
military spending in Czechoslovakia and Hungary rarely surpassed 3 per cent of GDP between 1957 and
1989.17
In establishing the quantitative record of socialist industrialization we need to treat o cial output data with
more than a modicum of suspicion. Government statistics were distorted to a large but non-quanti able
extent. Physical output indicators are considered comparatively trustworthy, but aggregates expressed in
value terms re ect unrealistic producer prices, incorrect weighting inasmuch as industry was always
attributed a higher than actual share in net material product, and inappropriate methods employed in the
computation of index numbers. Thankfully, independent Western research revised o cial gures using
data on physical output indicators exclusively, and applying Western accounting standards. The most
substantial work was carried out by the Research Project on National Income in East Central Europe under the
leadership of Thad P. Alton. A long series of publications report index numbers on GNP by sector of origin of
product, and industrial value added, for six countries including Czechoslovakia and Hungary. We use these
data to determine the composition of gross value added and of industrial production using the same
industry classi cations and compare these results with statistics for Austria and Germany.
p. 80
18
Economic growth in Central Europe after 1945 was industry-driven. From its post-war nadir, industrial
production recovered to pre-1939 levels by 1950 and grew rapidly for another two decades, signi cantly
faster than the rest of the economy. In all three countries, industrial value added measured in constant
prices doubled during the 1950s and tripled between 1950 and 1970 (see Table A4.2 in the appendix). In fact,
industrialization reached its peak only in the 1960s and 1970s when industry and construction employed
well over 40 per cent of the labour force. By contrast, the share of agricultural employment declined to less
than half of its initial level during the post-war golden age. In Czechoslovakia and Hungary, industry
remained the largest sector of the economy until the late 1980s.
Table 4.8 demonstrates the impact of forced industrialization in the 1950s and early 1960s in a comparative
perspective. The share of industrial value added in GDP increased signi cantly faster in Czechoslovakia and
Hungary than in Austria and Germany (GDR and Federal Republic combined). After 1968, when moderate
economic reforms relaxed authoritarian controls and introduced greater exibility for enterprise
management, industrial growth slowed down considerably. However, while the rate of industrialization was
declining in Germany after the oil shocks, it continued to increase until the mid-1980s in Central Europe.
East of the Iron Curtain, this was largely the consequence of the slow development of the service sector. In
Austria, it re ected more the overheating of industrial growth by ever-increasing state subsidies that began
to rock the federal budget by the 1980s and forced the government to begin privatizing state assets.

Post-war data give us a deeper insight into the structural development of the economy and the nature of
industrialization than what we have been able to establish for earlier periods. Table 4.9 shows that the share
of heavy industry and of modern manufacturing in gross industrial value added was similar across the
region, but mining and the production of basic materials remained more important in Czechoslovakia and
Hungary than in Austria and Germany. Whereas the share of modern manufacturing increased throughout
the period in Austria and Germany, it stagnated in the two socialist countries from the late 1960s onward.
This accords with the existing evidence pointing towards a growing technological lag between Western
nations and centrally planned economies after the golden age. This pattern is commonly attributed to
ine cient resource allocation and the ideologically driven preference for material production over
services. Additionally, the austerity policies introduced to combat the budgetary e ects of rising oil prices
and the debt crises that emerged in the 1980s (as a consequence of lavish borrowing during the 1970s and
the worsening terms of trade after 1980) also led to a reduction in investment levels, particularly
investment in new machinery.

In terms of growth, Central European economies performed similarly to other peripheral regions in Europe,
with some notable exceptions. As in Southern Europe and as in other countries within the Soviet bloc, the
growth of industrial production slowed considerably from the 1970s and was disrupted by a temporary
slump in the early 1980s. From the 1960s onwards, Central Europe was lagging behind Southern Europe in
terms of average growth rates, and from the mid-1970s Austria was also pulling away from Hungary and
Czechoslovakia. During the golden age, average rates of industrial expansion were also lower than in
Southeast Europe, which provides evidence for convergence within the Soviet bloc. After 1980, however, this
process of convergence broke down: typically the most advanced socialist economies performed best, in
terms of both aggregate growth and industrial development.

In Russia (not the whole Soviet Union), the increased price of hydrocarbons created new opportunities for
growth in heavy industry, not least thanks to investment in natural gas exploration and in new
transcontinental pipelines. In Czechoslovakia and Hungary, growth could be maintained because the
relatively more advanced economic structure of both countries made them more resistant to (although by
no means una ected by) the exogenous shocks of the early 1980s. Given that modern branches of
manufacturing, such as electrical engineering, and services accounted for a relatively larger share of their
GDP, they were hit less severely by the oil shocks than the less developed socialist economies.
Czechoslovakia and Hungary were also much less a ected by the debt crises of the 1980s than Poland or
Southeast Europe. Since, unlike virtually every other socialist country, Czechoslovakia did not borrow
extensively during the 1970s, it did not need to tighten the belt after borrowing costs rocketed following the
second oil shock. Hungary would have had to, but joined the IMF in 1982 (in a secret operation without the
prior knowledge of the Soviet leadership), which improved her position as a debtor. By contrast, Poland
and Romania su ered prolonged depressions under severe austerity imposed by the repressive
governments of General Jaruzelski and Nicolae Ceaușescu respectively; and, even if to a lesser extent,
austerity also had harsh economic consequences in Bulgaria and Yugoslavia.

4.5 The Legacy of Industrialization: Central Europe A er 1990
The collapse of the Soviet bloc and the socialist economic system caused a major depression in Eastern
Europe, a ecting both Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Between 1987 and 1992, industrial production declined
by 37 per cent and 28 per cent in the two countries respectively. In Czechoslovakia, the reduction in value
added was more than twice as large in mining and manufacturing as in the entire economy. Austrian
industry initially received a boost from the opening of Eastern markets and German reuni cation, in
particular, but this boom was short lived and turned into recession in 1991. From the mid-1990s, Central
Europe enjoyed strong growth that, not unlike in earlier periods, was propelled by industrial expansion (see
Table A4.2 in the appendix).
p. 83
Transition to a market economy delivered rst a killer blow to and then a blessing on Central European
industry. The liberalization of markets, the removal of import restrictions, and the introduction of hard
budget constraints nally exposed the ine ciency of state industries, leading to a sharp fall in output and
employment. In subsequent years, however, privatization and a massive in ow of foreign direct investment
(FDI) led to technological modernization and the rationalization of production. Industry-level data reported
by the EU KLEMS project shows that productivity growth since 1995 has stemmed largely from modern
manufacturing, the strongly export-oriented engineering industries in particular, where most FDI has been
concentrated. Since the launching of the euro, comparative advantage in manufacturing has shifted from
Southern to Central Europe. The growth impact of FDI was most noticeable in the automobile industry and
electrical engineering, in which the Czech and Slovak Republics as well as Hungary emerged as major
exporters within just a few years.

The quantitative evidence on structural change also reveals the relative importance of manufacturing in the
growth of Central European economies. Albeit declining since the late 1980s, the share of industry in the
labour force has remained considerably higher in the former Czechoslovakia and Hungary than in Austria
(see Table 4.7). As shown in Table 4.8, industry’s share in gross value added even increased in Hungary,
where privatization and the liberalization of capital markets was completed much faster than in the Czech
and Slovak Republics. The latter pursued more gradual reform programmes, and thus did not attract as
much manufacturing FDI before the late 1990s. In recent years, Central Europe has experienced a period of
re-industrialization and, in fact, has become proportionally more industrialized than Germany. Table 4.9
also reveals the impact of shifting comparative advantages on the structure of industrial production. The
share of heavy industry and, to a lesser extent, of modern manufacturing in gross industrial value added
declined sharply following the fall of Communism. By 2005, these shares had recovered, or even surpassed,
their highest previous levels; nevertheless the share of modern manufacturing in Central Europe has
continued to lag behind Germany.
Although transition to a market economy radically improved the development prospects of manufacturing
in both Hungary and the former Czechoslovakia, the countries are still tormented by various legacies of
socialism. The weakness of domestic small and medium-sized enterprises remains the main problem for
industrial policy. Whereas FDI helped modernize, restructure, and often reposition large rms, small
companies have had limited access to credit to nance investment in new equipment, and lack both the
technical and industry-speci c entrepreneurial know-how necessary to face up to the challenges of a newly
globalized market environment. The legacy of state management has also been manifest in the typical
responses of governments to this key problem. Tax concessions and direct subsidies to small enterprises,
alongside strategic agreements with foreign multinationals o ering indirect subsidies in exchange for self
imposed limitations on the share of imported inputs, did not reduce the technological backwardness and
lack of know-how that still limit the growth potential of domestic rms.

Nevertheless, Central European economies weathered the storms of the transition shock more successfully
than most other post-socialist countries, particularly the former Soviet and Yugoslav Republics. This can be
explained by the con uence of several factors. Both their geographical vicinity to core European markets,
particularly Germany, and their relatively rich endowments of skilled labour, but also their strong
commitments to market reforms from the early 1990s, made Central European countries initially more
attractive to Western investors than East and Southeast Europe. Czechoslovakia and Hungary, together with
Poland, had already been way ahead of most other socialist countries in terms of economic reforms during
the 1970s and 1980s. However, the comparatively much larger negative impact that the disintegration of the
Soviet Union and the violent break-up of the former Yugoslavia had on Eastern and Southeast Europe
during the early 1990s cannot be overlooked.

The quantitative evidence presented in this chapter allows us to derive several conclusions about the history
of industrialization in Central Europe. First, the region stepped into the industrial age before most of the
global periphery, but has not been able to narrow the developmental gap vis-à-vis the West European core.
Second, economic growth in the region has been and still is industry-driven: periods of strong growth were
marked by even faster industrial expansion, whereas the major calamities of the twentieth century, the
world wars and the collapse of state socialism, dislocated industry more than other sectors of economic
activity. Economic development in Central European countries during the last one hundred years has been
shaped by these major calamities, and their response was always strongly linked to industrialization and
industrial modernization. Third, growth in the contribution of industry to gross value added was strongly
correlated with a rising share of heavy industry, and especially modern manufacturing, in industrial
production. Finally, industrialization has always been characterized by more direct state involvement in
Central Europe than in the most advanced Western economies. In this respect, Gerschenkron was right:
under relative backwardness the state had to substitute for the lacking prerequisites. However,
interventionist policies did not help Central European nations exploit the advantages of their relative
backwardness. Falling behind the European core, not catching-up, was the experience during periods of
strong state management.

We use the labels Imperial Austria (or Cisleithania) and Imperial Hungary (or Transleithania) to distinguish the two main constituent parts of the Habsburg state a er the 1867 constitutional compromise from the far smaller, post-1918 successor states of Austria and Hungary in their new borders. Following Good (1984, pp. 15–17), the labels Alpine Austria (including the regions of Lower Austria, Upper Austria, Styria, Salzburg, Carinthia, Tyrol, and Vorarlberg) and Czech lands (Bohemia, Moravia, Silesia) are frequently used to identify the western and northwestern parts of the Habsburg Empire that were the most industrialized. Despite post-1918 border changes, these latter groupings correspond broadly with modern-day Austria and the Czech Republic.
1
Building on the estimates in Schulze (2000), Imperial Austriaʼs GDP was extrapolated backward from its 1870 level, drawing on rates of change in agriculture and services from Kausel (1979) and in industry from Komlos (1983). Likewise for modern Austria, with the exception of industry, which is projected backward using Kauselʼs rates of change.
2
By the eighteenth century, Bohemia and Moravia had become centres of the textiles (linen, woollen) and glass industries, while an internationally significant mining and metallurgy sector was located in Styria, Upper Austria, and Carinthia. In the 1760s, for instance, Styria alone produced as much pig iron as England (Good, 1984, pp. 20–1). The production of textiles in the Alpine lands was in the main located in and around Vienna, Upper Austria, and Vorarlberg.
3
By 1880 (1910), the proportion of the population resident in towns with more than 10,000 inhabitants had reached 47 (61) per cent in Lower Austria (including Vienna) and 10 (19) per cent in Bohemia (including Prague) compared to an average of 8 (14) per cent for the rest of Cisleithania; for the broader regions of Alpine Austria and the Czech lands, the figures are 23 (34) and (10) 18 per cent, respectively. From the 1860s, Budapest became the major centre of Hungarian manufacturing. Here, too, a high initial degree of urbanization is observable: in 1870, the capital city alone accounted for 14 per cent of the Danube–Tisza Basin regionʼs population; by 1910, this proportion had increased to 29 per cent (BologneseLeuchtenmüller, 1978, Table 14, pp. 40–1; MSE, 1895, 1913).

coe icients from a regression of aggregate average years of schooling in Imperial Austria and Imperial Hungary on aggregate lagged enrolment; see Schulze and Fernandes (2009) for underlying data, methods, and sources. 6 See Schulze (1996) on the development of Hungaryʼs machine-building industry. According to Komlosʼ (1983, Table E.4) index, Austrian manufacturing grew by 8.7 per cent per annum during 1867–71 and 1.8 per cent during 1871–84. Whilst also showing a peak in 1871, the more comprehensive index documented in Table A.4.1 in the appendix increases by less than 1 per cent over the period.
7
8 Cf. Schulze (2007a) on comparative sectoral productivity growth. The category of non-engineering ʻmetal-workingʼ industries, ranging from the production of nails and screws to metal furniture, has been excluded.
9
Note that Ho mannʼs (1965) figures refer to Germany in its pre-First World War rather than its post-1990 boundaries. In 1910, manufacturing (including cra s as for the Habsburg Empire) accounted for 29.1 per cent, mining for 2.8 per cent, utilities for 0.3 per cent, and construction for 5.2 per cent of the total labour force.
10
This assessment is grounded in new estimates for the successor states. They are based on the regional data underlying the reconstructed labour force estimates for Imperial Austria and Imperial Hungary and border adjustments; for sources and methods, see Appendix A in Schulze (2007a). For modern Austria and Czechoslovakia, the share of the labour force in manufacturing moves from c.22 per cent in 1870 to about 28 per cent in 1910; for Hungary, it moves from less than 9 to almost 15 per cent. Note that the 1910 figures deviate slightly from those presented in Table 4.7; this is mainly due to corrections in the estimated agricultural labour force for 1870–1910.

The border region with Germany produced about 55 per cent of Czechoslovak hard coal, 93 per cent of brown coal, 61 per cent of textiles, 38 per cent of chemicals, 45 per cent of stone and clay products, and 30 per cent of engineering products.
