Keywords: Crisis Recovery Growth Tariff Terms of trade Policy
abstract
What drives recoveries after financial crises? I address this question for the 1870–1913 “first era of globalization,” focusing on whether trade policy changes or positive movements in commodity prices played a bigger role in stimulating output growth after financial crises in peripheral economies. At this time before governments had modern fiscal and monetary policy tools to use while responding to crises protectionism was one of the few national-level policy options available for shaping economic activity. Improving terms of trade is another major factor that could influence output growth in the commodity-exporting countries included in this analysis. While previous studies of this period have looked at longer-run associations between these explanatory variables and economic growth, I focus on the aftermath of crises, and find that tariff rate increases had a positive impact on GDP per capita growth, while positive terms of trade changes did not have a significant effect on output growth. This suggests that governments played a substantial role in shaping post-crisis recoveries during this period.
“To excuse an indifference towards the control of depressions because the latter are always followed by revival is, indeed, tantamount to saying that we should not seek to abolish or lessen wars because they, too, are always followed by a period of peace.” Paul Douglas (U.S. Senator and economist) (1935, pp. 80–81)
1. Introduction
How do economies recover from financial crises? There are different answers to this question across history. In a recent study of advanced economies during the postwar period, Romer and Romer (2018) assess the impact that macroeconomic policy responses played in the recoveries from financial crises. I extend that analysis further back in time, focusing on recoveries from banking crises during the globalized 1870–1913 period, when crises were more frequent. Focusing on peripheral economies, I assess whether renewed post-crisis growth was driven more by changes to trade policies or changes in the terms of trade.1 In general, governments played a less active role in managing economies during this period than they do today.2 Fiscal policy was not implemented as a response to economic crises the way it is today. The gold standard constrained monetary responses to crises (but it could be suspended temporarily to allow for short-term discretionary policy actions; see Bordo and Rockoff, 1996, p. 394;

Support for people suffering during economic downturns came from local charities or municipalities rather than from the federal government (Closson, 1894).

Eichengreen and Bordo, 2002). Tariffs were one of the few economic policy tools available for responding to crises. Additionally, peripheral economies at this time were highly dependent on commodity exports for generating income. Positive changes to commodity export prices could help propel an economy out of a recession. I focus on these two explanatory variables – protectionist policies and positive changes to the terms of trade – to analyze the key factors that drove economic recovery after banking crises around the turn of the twentieth century.3 One strand of the literature on historical recoveries from financial crises focuses on summarizing trends that recoveries have followed over the long-run. Reinhart and Rogoff (2014), for example, present a comprehensive overview of the available historical data on recoveries. They measure the number of years for business cycle peaks-to-troughs and peaks-to-recoveries over 100 crisis periods from 1857–2013.4 While that research is very useful for getting a long-run overview of the duration and depth of crises, it does not offer an in-depth analysis of the factors that drove recoveries. Other historical studies of recoveries tend to be more narrowly focused on specific periods, especially the Great Depression.5 The cross-country study in this paper contributes to these two veins of the research on historical recoveries by testing which economic variables were most strongly associated with renewed post-crisis growth. And by focusing on the globally interconnected and macroeconomically volatile 1870–1913 period, this analysis extends the types of studies that have been undertaken for the 1930s further back in history. This also builds on the recent finding from Xu (2020) that nineteenth century banking crises had persistent negative impacts on trade. By focusing on tariffs and terms of trade changes, I examine how the trade environment impacted broader macroeconomic recoveries from crises. To test how these factors were associated with recoveries, I set GDP per capita as the dependent variable and use a treatment effects methodology that estimates the difference in output growth between two alternative cases: (1) that all countries experience positive changes to tariffs or the terms of trade in the aftermath of a banking crisis, and (2) that no countries experience positive changes to these variables after a crisis. The difference between these two cases is the average treatment effect, or the average impact that these changes had on post-crisis output growth. The main result is that higher tariff rates were positively associated with higher post-crisis GDP per capita growth, while positive terms of trade changes had a small and negative impact on growth. If all countries experienced positive tariff rate changes during a recession, the average output growth rate would be 3.4%, compared to an average growth rate of 1.2% if no countries had higher tariff rates during a recession.6 This finding – that protectionist policies were associated with recoveries around the globalized and volatile turn of the 20th century – suggests that governments played more of a role in shaping recoveries than is typically appreciated for this relatively laissez-faire period.7
2. Tariffs, terms of trade, and economic growth
2.1. Growth literature
Tariffs can spur economic growth by supporting development through infant industry protection (List, 1909[1841]; Amsden, 1989; Juhász, 2018). Protectionism can also encourage growth when import-competing sectors have positive production externalities, or when especially technologically dynamic industries are protected (Rodríguez and Rodrik, 2000, p. 268), and protectionist policies can boost output in the protected sectors. Also, “the world [trade policy] environment matters” – the negative correlation between tariffs and growth later in the twentieth century might have been diminished or even reversed if average tariffs had been higher across trading partners (Clemens and Williamson, 2004, p. 5) as was the case at the turn of the twentieth century. Previous studies spanning the turn of the twentieth century analyze the longer-run connections between average tariff rates and economic growth (Clemens and Williamson, 2004; Irwin, 2002; Jacks, 2019; O’Rourke, 2000; Schularick and Solomou, 2011; TenaJunguito, 2010; Vamvakidis, 2002). While early studies (Clemens and Williamson, 2004; O’Rourke, 2000) found that the overall relationship between tariffs and growth was positive for the late nineteenth century, increasingly the evidence suggests that this relationship is “complex, time-varying and may display significant heterogeneity” (Schularick and Solomou, 2011, p. 35). To address this heterogeneity, other research has focused on tariffs across different categories of products (Lehmann and O’Rourke, 2011). Additionally, more recent analyses have employed time series and case study methodologies to study the impact of tariffs across individual countries. For example, using annual data (Lampe and Sharp, 2013) find that while the relationship between tariffs and
3 Tariff rates are measured as total government revenue from imports over the value of imports to a given country in a given year. Terms of trade is the ratio of export to import prices. 4 Related studies of the recoveries from financial crises include (Baldacci et al., 2009; Cerra and Saxena, 2008; Fatás and Mihov, 2013; Ha and Kang, 2015; Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009a; Reinhart and Rogoff, 2009b). Also see the research on whether recoveries occur as “Phoenix Miracles” (when recoveries happen without a reliance on credit): Calvo et al. (2006), Biggs et al. (2010). Additionally, (Brunnermeier and Schnabel, 2016) study 400 years of bubbles, crises, and recoveries, looking at central banks’ roles through each of these business cycle phases. 5 Economic studies of the interwar period are too numerous to cite here in full, but several more recent studies that focus on recovery during the 1930s include (Chouliarakis and Gwiazdowski, 2017; Eggertsson, 2012; Hausman et al., 2017; Jalil and Rua, 2016; Payne and Uren, 2014; Quincy, 2018; Taylor and Neumann, 2016), and (Jacobson et al., 2019). A contemporary study focusing on the question of recovery during the Great Depression is Brown et al.(1968 [1934]). 6 These should be understood as partial equilibrium results, capturing the average short-run positive impacts that tariff rate increases would have on output during the aftermath of a crisis. 7 Letwin (1989) summarizes how different periods of U.S. history, for example, have been characterized as either laissez-faire or “welfare state,” with the turn of the twentieth century being more laissez-faire. The “laissez-faire” description of this period has been challenged by Novak (1996, 2008) and Palen (2015).

income differed by country, for most countries the overall relationship between tariffs and income was negative. And focusing just on Switzerland from 1886–1913, (Charles, 2017) finds that “moderate and selective” protectionism was associated with increased exports from new industries, lending weight to the infant industry argument for protectionism. While national governments in peripheral countries mostly took a hands-off approach to their economies over the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, tariff policies were one of the tools used by governments to directly impact economic activity.8 Additionally, at this time tariffs were a main source of government revenue, and stabilizing the political and economic system through balancing the budget was a stated aim of protectionists.9 In the analysis below, a measure of a positive change in average tariff rates is one of the two main explanatory variables, to estimate the impact that raising tariff rates in the aftermath of a financial crisis could have on driving renewed output growth. Improving terms of trade is another factor that has been shown to be associated with higher output growth over this period, as the ratio of export prices to import prices moves in country’s favor.10 Even transient, positive terms of trade shocks have been shown to permanently raise both the level and the average growth rate of output (Basu and Mcleod, 1992). In the other direction, downward swings in commodity prices have often been followed by broader economic downturns, and sometimes financial crises and sovereign defaults (Davis et al., 2009; Reinhart et al., 2016). Early studies of this period focused on the impact that changes in the terms of trade had on the severity of economic downturns. For example, it has been argued that Argentina’s recovery after the 1890 Baring Crisis was prolonged in part because of depressed prices for Argentina’s export commodities (Ford, 1956). It has also been argued that recovery in the United States after the 1893 panic was boosted when commodity prices increased in 1897 (after a double-dip recession occurred in 1896) (White, 1939). In the empirical analysis below, I test whether such relationships between commodity price movements and post-crisis recoveries existed across peripheral countries over this period.
2.2. Brief case study: the United States during the 1890s
The recovery from the 1890s depression in the United States illustrates how changes in average tariff rates and the terms of trade aligned with broader output movements in the aftermath of financial crises. This highlights the debate around whether changes in tariffs or the terms of trade had more of an impact on recoveries from crises at this time. The subsequent cross-country econometric analysis tests which of these factors was associated with recoveries across a wide range of peripheral countries during this period. As detailed above, the turn of the twentieth century has often been characterized as the historical zenith of laissez-faire capitalism, before the rise of the Progressive Era and the New Deal. But it has also been argued that governments took a more active role in shaping economic outcomes during this time than is typically appreciated.11 The trade policy debates in the United States after the panic of 1893 offer an example of the debates that were taking place about whether governments should employ policy measures to respond to crises. A Democratic presidency overlapped with the mid-1890s depression and the implementation of more liberalized trade policies from 1894–97. This allowed protectionist-minded Republicans to assert that free trade policies prolonged the depression. They argued that protectionist policies would renew confidence in domestic industry and balance the federal budget through increased tariff revenues. After the Republican William McKinley assumed the presidency in 1897, tariff rates were raised to some of the highest levels ever seen in the United States. In that same year, the economy also began to recover from the mid-1890s depression (the most severe depression through that point in U.S. history). This allowed protectionists to claim that their higher tariff rates were indeed effective for spurring renewed output growth and bringing the depression to an end. The empirical analysis below tests protectionists claims that higher tariff rates would stabilize expectations and promote investment and growth after crises. Early studies of this period also highlighted the role that terms of trade movements played in impacting the severity of economic downturns, and generating recoveries. For example, White (1939) argued that recovery in the United States after the 1893 panic was strengthened when commodity prices increased in 1897. Along these same lines, Andrew (1906) argued that for the turn of the century U.S. “[a]n unusually large harvest in this country, if accompanied by small harvests abroad, obviously means prosperity for the American farmers, means large exports and high prices, tends to mean incoming gold and expanding credit.” (1906, p. 329). Thus “the beginnings of every movement toward business prosperity...were closely connected with the out-turn of crops (ibid., p. 351).” These changes in international commodity market conditions are captured by the terms of trade, and improving terms of trade in the late 1890s coincided with the recovery from depression. The turning-points in the economic output data for the 1890s are shown in middle of panel (a) in Fig. 1, along with the average tariff rate and terms of trade data for the United States across this period: Vertical lines mark the 1893 panic, and the year that sustained recovery began, 1897 (the GDP and GDP per capita data are presented in panel (b)). The broader economic recovery coincides with an increase in average tariff rates and improved terms of trade, and contemporaries argued in favor of both protectionism and higher commodity prices as supporting that recovery. The empirical analysis below tests more formally which of these variables – higher tariff rates or improved terms of trade – was more instrumental for driving recoveries across a range of peripheral economies at this time.

Protectionism was also implemented during later crises, such as the Great Depression (Eichengreen and Irwin, 2010). 9 Noyes (1909), p. 269; Savage (1988), pp. 140–141. 10 See Blattman et al.

3. Empirical evidence
3.1. Data: tariffs, terms of trade, and recessions
The main variables used in this analysis are annual average tariff rates, terms of trade, and GDP per capita estimates for 35 countries for the years 1870–1913.12 The output, tariff, and terms of trade data are from the Blattman et al. (2007) database.13 Tariff rates are calculated as total government revenue from imports over the value of imports to that country in that year, and terms of trade is the ratio of export to import prices. The main explanatory variables are whether or not there were positive changes in average tariff rates or the terms of trade during crises or subsequent recessions.14 Measures of changes to these variables are derived from the Hamilton (2018) filter. Hamilton’s filter is a regression-based method of separating the cyclical components from trends in time series, without generating new relationships in the data (which is a shortcoming of the Hodrick–Prescott filtering method). For each country, if the Hamilton filter’s cyclical component of the tariff or terms of trade data is greater than or equal to one standard deviation of the underlying series then that is coded as a major positive change to these variables (following Mendoza and Terrones, 2008, p. 5). I then create a new variable, which equals 1 if the first year of a positive change (based on the Hamilton filter cyclical component) to the tariff or the terms of trade occurred during a crisis year or subsequent recession. These new variables are the main explanatory variables focused on in the analysis below. A country is coded as being in a recession if its post-crisis GDP per capita is below its pre-crisis peak. The definition of recoveries from financial crises is generally consistent across the existing literature. Bordo and Meissner (2016, pp. 40–41), for example, define recovery as “the number of years until the level of real GDP per capita attains the prior peak it reached.” Such peak-to-trough-to-peak frameworks are also adopted by Reinhart and Rogoff (2014), Bivens (2016), and others. Since these are annual data, and a positive change in tariff rates in January could be connected with a country’s output attaining a new peak later that year, I set the post-crisis indicator variable equal to 1 if positive changes to the tariff or terms of trade variables begin during the first year of a crisis, the subsequent recession, or the year that post-crisis GDP per capita has reached its pre-crisis peak.
12 The empirical analysis below is limited to the subsample of peripheral economies that experienced banking crises during this period, shown in Table 1. 13 The tariff rates in this data set were compiled by Clemens and Williamson (2004). The terms of trade data are constructed by Blattman et al. (2007, p. 163) from commodity price series (updated for Williamson, 2011). The GDP per capita series from this database is mostly from Maddison (1995) but is supplemented with other data series when available. I am grateful to Jeffrey Williamson for sharing an updated version of this database with me in September 2016. 14 Tariff changes are more likely to be anticipated than changes to the terms of trade, as tariff rates are determined politically (Williamson, 2006, p.199). The empirical literature on trade restrictions accounts for tariff “shocks” as well as gradual changes in tariff rates (Auernheimer and George, 1997; Malakellis, 1998). Sometimes governments deliberately phase in tariffs gradually in order to reduce the shock effect (Irwin, 2014, p. 8). While some tariff policy changes are anticipated and/or gradual, treating tariff changes as shocks is common practice in the empirical trade literature (Lanclos and Hertel, 1995; Spearot, 2016). In the analysis below, it is sufficient to measure positive tariff rate and terms of trade changes above a particular threshold, without requiring these positive changes to be interpretted as “shocks.”

Notes: Output growth, tariff, and terms of trade are averages of the annual data series for these variables, from 1870-1913. Output growth is the annual growth (%) of GDP per capita. Crises and recessions: the dates displayed in this table mark banking crisis years, and/or years when GDP per capita has not reached pre-crisis peak again after a banking crisis. Sources: The GDP per capita, tariff, and terms of trade data are from the (Blattman et al., 2007) database, and the banking crisis dates are from Reinhart and Rogoff (2009b).
The averages of annual GDP per capita, tariff rate, and terms of trade data series are shown in Table 1, which divides the sample into core and peripheral economies. Banking crises and recessions are also shown in this table. The dates mark banking crisis years, and any subsequent years when GDP per capita had not yet returned to its pre-crisis peak.
3.2. Analysis: treatment effects
To test the impact that positive changes to tariff rates and the terms of trade had on post-crisis economic growth, I employ a treatment effects methodology.15 The estimation technique offers a counterfactual method that estimates the average impact that a binary “treatment” has on a dependent variable. If a treatment is not randomly distributed across a population, a treatment effect methodology can be used post hoc to estimate what the average impact of the treatment would be on the dependent variable if every subject were to receive the treatment, versus the average impact if no subject received the treatment. In this analysis, the subjects are the countries in the sample, the treatments are the positive changes to tariffs and the terms of trade (based on the Hamilton filter outcomes described above) during post-crisis periods, and the outcome variable is GDP per capita growth.

The general formula for calculating average treatment effects is
AT E = 1
N
N ∑
i
y1(i) − y0(i) (1)
with y1(i) being the “treated” case, or the output growth of a country (i) that did experience higher tariff rates or improved terms of trade in the aftermath of a crisis, and y0(i) being the “not treated” case, or the output growth of a country that did not experience higher tariff rates or terms of trade after a crisis. An issue with observational data, such as the historical economic data used here, is that its treatment assignment is not purely random, in the way that it could be in an experimental setting. An additional issue is that only one potential outcome is actually observed (and the other potential outcome is missing). When dealing with tariff policy changes, for example, it is not likely that the missing outcomes are random. In this counterfactual analysis, a positive change to tariffs or the terms of trade either occurred or did not occur in a particular country during a particular year. For individual countries, it is not possible to actually observe all potential outcomes, because either one scenario happened or the other did. For example, in 1897, the average tariff rate began increasing in the United States. We cannot simultaneously have data for a world in which tariff rates did not begin increasing in 1897 in the United States. Instead, we have to estimate the average treatment effects of the potential outcomes, or the expected effect of treatment on a randomly selected country. To account for these issues, I use an inverse-probability-weighted (IPW) estimator to estimate the treatment effects. IPW estimators model the probability of treatment, by weighting observations on the outcome variable by the inverse of the probability that it is observed. These inverse probability weights are used to estimate the weighted averages, or potential outcome means, for each treatment. The other component of this estimation process is the treatment model. I use a probit version of the treatment model, which is simply a probit model that has the treatment (whether or not a post-crisis change in tariff rates or terms of trade occurred) as the dependent variable, and standard growth regression control variables as the independent variables (logged initial GDP per capita, the proportion of the population with primary schooling, and population growth) to account for other factors that could shape the growth trajectories of these countries.16 The IPW estimator, with y as the observed outcome variable (potential outcomes: y0 and y1) and t ε {0, 1} being the treatment variable, is: 1

∑N i=1

p(xi) for E(y1). p(xi) is the probability that the treatment occurs (ti = 1), and xi are the covariates. Both the inverse probability weighting and the treatment model are estimated simultaneously, yielding the average treatment effects.17 The results from these treatment effects IPW estimations are shown in Table 2. The first three columns focus on the tariff case, and columns 4-6 focus on the terms of trade case. For each of these sets of results, the potential outcome means (the GDP per capita growth rates) are shown for the scenarios when all countries in the sample are subject to a positive change in the treatment variables and when none of the countries experience such a change. Then the average treatment effect is shown for each case. Again, these average treatment effects are the difference between the potential outcome means, yielding an estimated impact of a treatment on output growth. The main results are presented in row (a) of Table 2. Again, the main explanatory variables of interest are whether or not there was a positive change to tariffs or terms of trade during a post-crisis period. The sample is limited to the peripheral economies, defined above. The potential outcome mean in column 1 is the estimation that the average GDP per capita growth rate would be 3.4% if all countries experienced a positive tariff rate change after a crisis. In contrast, if no country experienced a positive tariff change (column 2), GDP per capita would have only increased 1.2%. The average treatment effect (column 3) is the difference between these potential outcome means, in this case 2.2%. So if all countries experienced an increase in tariffs during the aftermath of a financial crisis, those countries would have output growth rates a full two percentage points higher than if none of the countries experienced such a change. By focusing only on the aftermath of financial crises, these results align with theories that suggest the short-term impact of tariffs would be positive (by protecting domestic industry and encouraging investment), but that the long-run impact could be negative (as firms grew complacent and inefficient as a result of being protected from competition, for example, and/or through deadweight losses).18 Additionally, there are particular short-run concerns that are heightened in the aftermath of crises, namely the desire to promote stability and manage expectations by assuring firms and investors that the government has a plan for what trade policies will be implemented. As the mayor of New York City complained in 1897, it is “constant and repeated changes [in tariff rates] that unsettle the business of this country” (“Dingley Bill Discussed”). Tariff policies were one of the few options available for governments in these countries to intervene in their economies at this time, and these results suggest that such policies were associated with renewed output growth after financial crises. Columns 4 and 5 of row (a) show the estimates of post-crisis output growth for the case when all countries experience a positive terms of trade change (column 4) versus when none of them experience such a change (column 5). The GDP per capita growth rate would be lower (0.05%) if all countries experienced a positive terms of trade change compared to the case where they did not (1.2%). The average treatment effect (column 6), then, indicates that the positive terms of trade change would be associated with output growth being −0.7 lower. This negative relationship between post-crisis terms of trade changes and output growth aligns

Number of observations: 1,246 in rows a, b, c, d, e, and f; 258 in row g. Notes: This analysis uses treatment effect estimation methods to test the impact on GDP per capita growth when there was a positive change in tariffs or terms of trade during the first year of a banking crisis and any following years of recession (years when GDP per capita was below the pre-crisis peak), compared to estimates of output per capita growth had such changes not occurred. The treatment effect estimation method used is a probit version of an inverse probability weighting estimator. Columns 1–3 are the tariff case, columns 4–6 are the terms of trade case. The columns labeled “POM” present the potential outcome means, and the columns “ATE” present the average treatment effect. Each row in the table presents results from different IPW tests, which are described in detail in the main body of this paper but summarized here: (a) baseline results, with the main explanatory variables being whether or not there was a positive change to tariffs or terms of trade during a post-crisis period; (b) focusing on the five years preceding a financial crisis rather than post-crisis periods; (c) including positive changes to the explanatory variables that occurred at any time from 1870–1913; (d) controlling for countries that had above-average tariff rates across the sample period; (e) including both the tariff and terms of trade positive change indicators in the treatment model; (f) including the original continuous tariff and terms of trade variables (as opposed to the positive change indicator variables) as controls; (g) limiting the sample to core rather than peripheral countries. Robust standard errors in parentheses. The additional controls are logged initial GDP per capita, the proportion of the population with primary schooling, and population growth. The sample in rows (a)-(f) is limited to the peripheral countries for which data are available, and the sample in row (g) is limited to the core countries (as specified in Table 1). ∗ p<0.10, ∗∗ p<0.05, ∗∗∗ p<0.01.
with the findings from Blattman et al. (2007), for example, as they argue that terms of trade volatility was associated with negative output growth in peripheral economies during this period, because terms of trade volatility made countries less attractive destinations for foreign capital inflows. Terms of trade volatility during the aftermath of a crisis would yield a particularly unattractive foreign investment environment. There are several key ways that this initial analysis can be strengthened. First, I test whether post-crisis periods really are unique – that a similar positive and significant association between tariff increases and higher output growth was not seen for other subsamples of these data. To test this, row (b) displays the results from running the same estimations used in row (a), but now focusing on the five years preceding a financial crisis. There were not enough episodes of positive tariff changes during pre-crisis periods for estimates to be generated. And for the terms of trade case (row (b), columns 4–6) there was no difference in output growth rates whether or not there was a pre-crisis positive change in this variable. Similarly, I then re-run the baseline estimation (from row (a)) but now including positive changes to the explanatory variables that occurred at any time from 1870-1913 (as opposed to focusing more narrowly on changes that occurred during post-crisis periods). These ATE results (row (c), column 3) show that, in general across the whole sample period, GDP per capita growth rates were no higher whether there was or was not a tariff increase. This highlights the particular impact that tariff increases had on output growth in post-crisis periods. Across the whole sample period, terms of trade increases, however, were associated with average output rates of 0.2%, compared to 0.12% for the case where such changes did not occur (row (c), columns 4 and 5). Thus positive terms of trade movements could have a stimulating impact in general across this period. Another concern is that countries that already had relatively high tariff rates on average would be the countries most comfortable with protectionism, and that those countries would be more likely to raise tariff rates as a response to a crisis. To account for this, I add an indicator variable to control for countries that had above-average tariff rates across the sample period. These results (row (d)) generally align with the baseline results, though the difference between the positive tariff change case and the case where tariffs did change is no longer statistically significant. Rows (e) and (f) present results from alternative versions of the main IPW estimation. The row (e) version of the estimation includes both the tariff and terms of trade positive change indicators in the treatment model. For example, the treatment model that


P.H. Bent Explorations in Economic History 78 (2020) 101354
has the first year of a positive post-crisis tariff change as the main treatment explanatory variable now also includes the positive post-crisis terms of trade change indicator as a control. The row (f) estimations include the original continuous tariff and terms of trade variables (as opposed to the positive change indicator variables) as controls. All of these results closely match the baseline results. A broader concern could be that these results do not tell us information about the unique experiences of peripheral economies during this period, but simply capture economic trends that all countries faced during this globalized era. To account for this possibility, I limit the analysis to the “core” countries defined above, and run the same IPW estimations used to generate the results in row (a). The results for the core countries are shown in row (g). Average growth rates during post-crisis periods were higher for core countries if they did not experience a positive tariff change, which suggests that protectionism was uniquely helpful for spurring recoveries in less developed economies at this time. Additionally, average growth rates were higher for core countries when they did not experience post-crisis terms of trade changes.19 This indicates that, on average, it was better for a core country’s recovery prospects to have more stable terms of trade across this period. While the focus of this analysis is trade policies and changes to the terms of trade, it is possible that omitted variables bias these results, and future research can build alternative measures of price movements and policy changes that could have influenced recoveries at this time.
4. Conclusion
This paper builds on previous research that focuses on (1) recoveries from financial crises, (2) the connections between tariff rates and economic growth, and (3) terms of trade movements and economic growth. The literature on long-run tariff-growth correlations across this period has been especially contentious. By focusing specifically on recoveries after financial crises, the question addressed in this paper is more narrow. For post-crisis periods between 1870 and 1913, I find a positive association between higher tariff rates and output growth, and less of a role for terms of trade movements in shaping recoveries from crises. This suggests that national governments played a more active role in influencing recoveries than has often been appreciated for the “first era of globalization” around the turn of the twentieth century.

19 The large negative result in column 4 of row (g) could be capturing the fact that the core country sample had relatively stable terms of trade across this period, compared to the more severe swings in the terms of trade across peripheral economies, so that when core countries did experience a terms of change change it had more of a destabilizing impact on macroeconomic activity in the short-run.
