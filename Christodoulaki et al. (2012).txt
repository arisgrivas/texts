ABSTRACT
Time series of daily data for Greek sovereign risk have been compiled and
analysed statistically to shed light on the way that historical events,
including political and institutional changes, determined the
creditworthiness of the Greek government on the London stock market
from the start of the Great War until the Great Crash. No a priori
important dates were specified. The Asia Minor campaign and its
aftermath exerted a strongly negative impact on the value of Greek
sovereign debt and as a result the risk premium increased rapidly.
Statistical analysis shows that investors acted upon news of fiscal
performance and public debt developments. Unforeseen political changes
also influenced market participants’ expectations. By contrast,
institutional innovations such as the adoption of the Gold Exchange
Standard and the establishment of a central bank denovodid not result in
any quantitative market response. However, stabilisation and the
concomitant institutional reforms were gradually factored into the market
price of Greek sovereign debt traded in London and as a result the
creditworthiness of the Greek government steadily improved.

1. Introduction
The aim of this paper is to explore the way that historical events including
political and institutional changes influenced market participants’ expectations
of the capacity of the Greek government to honour its debt obligations, thereby
determining Greek sovereign risk on the London market from the start of the
Great War until the Great Crash. At a time when the sovereign debt crisis of the
European periphery has made both policy makers and European Union citizens
observe nervously the default risk of those countries, a historical perspective
which combines a statistical analysis of the way that country risk has fluctuated
in the past with an examination of the factors that influenced investors’
behaviour seems all the more essential.
Three time series of Greek sovereign risk have been compiled by using newly
collected data on Greek government loans denominated in gold and traded on
the London Stock Exchange, benchmarked against the British consol. The data
is from daily observations and was collected by hand from The London Times
and the Stock Exchange Daily Official List.2 The three time series of country
risk constructed were considered statistically in isolation from their historical
context. No dates were specified a priori as significant. The period in question
is historically complex. For Greece in particular it includes wars, military
triumph and final defeat as well as political and monetary upheaval. It ends

with Greece experiencing a period, albeit short-lived, of political and monetary
stability.3
The underlying assumption here is that information which affects a security's
expected pay-off is incorporated into its price.4 Hence, this work contributes to
the literature which combines historical data with statistical evidence, to
examine the way that news interacts with capital markets to determine asset
prices.5 It complements the existing literature by examining the period from the
outbreak of the First World War until the advent of the Great Depression. In
this way, it extends earlier analysis of the sovereign debt of economies during
the classical period of the Gold Standard into an adjacent but very different
historical era.6 The paper makes a further contribution through the data it
employs. This is the first time that daily time series for Greek sovereign risk
have been compiled and presented in such a systematic way. Finally, it
introduces to the literature of economic history a new statistical method that
can be used to detect time series breakpoints.
The country risk time series analysed here show that military defeat and its
aftermath exerted a strongly negative impact on the value of Greek sovereign
debt traded on the London market and that consequently the Greek default risk
soared. The statistical analysis demonstrates that announcements relating to the
fiscal strength of the country and on public debt developments as well as
unexpected political events in Athens did influence investors’ expectations. By
contrast, the establishment of a central bank de novo and de jure introduction of
the Gold Exchange Standard did not produce any quantitative market response.
Research into the London press of the period establishes that market
participants were able to stay very well informed about developments in

Greece.7 Formal announcements on institutional changes such as the adoption
of the Gold Exchange Standard and the establishment of a central bank could
hardly contain new information. These reforms generally take a long time to be
promulgated and need to be ratified by parliament. Market actors observed and
evaluated every step taken towards reconstruction. As a result, stabilisation and
the concomitant institutional reforms were gradually factored into the market
price of Greek government debt traded on the London Stock Exchange and as a
result the risk premium demanded by investors steadily fell.
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section 2 provides a brief
history of the period under consideration while Section 3 describes the data
employed. The method followed in the statistical analysis is developed in
Section 4 and the results are presented. In Section 5 the breakpoints located in
the time series are discussed and correlated to news that influenced investors’
expectations. The paper finishes with some concluding remarks.
2. Historical Context
When the guns fell silent on the western front late in 1918, Greece was on the
winning side and its government was led by Eleftherios Venizelos.
‘Unprecedented prosperity and reckless optimism’8 prevailed, as the end of the
Great War coincided with territorial expansion and economic prosperity. The
creation of a Greater Greece in the Near East, a long-standing national
aspiration that had been embraced by most political leaders since
Independence, seemed within reach. In May 1919 Greek troops disembarked in
Smyrna and the Treaty of Sèvres granted Greece sovereignty over Thrace as far
as the Chatalja line. At that time the drachma maintained its pre-war parity and
had become a symbol of the country’s economic vigour.

Careful analysis, however, shows up contradictory evidence of macroeconomic
weakness. Between 1914 and 1919 the price level had more than tripled and the
currency in circulation had increased more than fivefold. The increase in the
money supply did not cause any concern to the monetary authorities, who
believed at the time that the stability of the drachma was indisputable.
The jubilation of victory at the end of the war temporarily concealed the extent
of the national schism created by the greater conflict.9 This schism had literally
split the country in two: the Premier of the country Eleftherios Venizelos had
aspired to a policy of intervention on the side of the Allies while the King had
been in favour of the country remaining neutral. The Premier believed in the
final victory of the Entente, bring territorial gains to Greece, whilst the King
had faith in Germany’s military supremacy. This crisis had come to a head in
1916-17. King Constantine was forced to leave the country and in June 1917,
the Venizelos government declared war on the Central Powers.
A few months after the signing of the Treaty of Sèvres in November 1920,
Venizelos was overwhelmingly defeated in a general election.10 This general
election which brought the Populist Party to power, together with the
unexpected death of the young King Alexander who had succeeded his father,
paved the way for the return of the exiled King Constantine to Athens.
Following a referendum held on 22nd November (Julian)/5th December
(Gregorian)11 1920, King Constantine was officially returned to the Greek
throne. Immediately, the Allied governments warned Athens that the
repatriation of King Constantine meant that they no longer considered
themselves bound by the Treaty of Sèvres. Greece would also encounter a

11 At the time, Greece was following the Julian calendar which lagged 13 days behind the Gregorian that was used by almost all of the rest of Europe. Greece introduced the Gregorian calendar on 16th February 1923, which thus became 1st March. During the period in question, when Greece was following the Julian calendar, dates are given for both calendars. It should be emphasized that the data collected, both the time series employed and the press cuttings gathered, come from London publications which used the Gregorian calendar.

financial embargo and cancellation of the war debt agreements.12 Political
historiography and military sources relate subsequent events in Asia Minor to
the return of the pro-German King to the Greek throne. Careful examination,
however, of geopolitical developments in the area in late 1920 does not support
the view that the outcome of the election had a catalytic effect on the course of
history.13
The Greek army marched into the interior of Asia Minor meeting little
resistance but giving time for Mustapha Kemal to prepare his army for an
attack. In August 1922, the army of Ataturk launched its final offensive.14
Hundreds of thousands of people fled the Turkish advance. Many of them
headed to Smyrna believing that they would be protected there. On 27th August
(Julian)/9th September (Gregorian), the Turkish army entered Smyrna in
pursuit. What followed is vividly described in history books and in the press of
the day. The panic and desperation culminated on 31st August (Julian)/13th
September (Gregorian) when Smyrna was set ablaze. A mass of destitute
refugees, allegedly 300,000 people, had already gathered at the port,
desperately seeking any kind of craft on which to escape the horror.15 As a
consequence hundreds of thousands of refugees, chiefly women, children and
old men arrived on the Greek islands near Asia Minor or reached Pireaus. In
January 1923, a convention was signed at Lausanne which provided for a
compulsory exchange of populations between Greece and Turkey, recognising
in this way, a process that to a great extent had already occurred.16 In a very
short period of time, the population of Greece had increased by twenty per
cent.17

The ‘Catastrophe,’ as the Asia Minor debacle is known in Greece, had an
immediate impact upon Greek politics. A faction of military officers,
supporters of Venizelos, formed a Revolutionary Committee, deposed the
Royalist government in Athens and assumed power on 15th (Julian)/28th
September (Gregorian) 1922. King Constantine was forced to abdicate, this
time in favour of his eldest son, and left Athens for the last time.
At first, private initiative and philanthropic organisations provided relief for
refugees. It soon became apparent, however, that huge resources would be
needed for the resettlement of the more than a million people, who had by this
time crossed the Aegean Sea from Asia Minor. As Figures 1 and 2 show, late in
1922 the creditworthiness of the Greek government on the London market was
very low. Greek sovereign risk had rocketed to nearly 21 per cent, reflecting
the political, economic and financial distress that prevailed in Athens. In
February 1923 Greece approached the Council of the League of Nations hoping
to float an international loan under its aegis for the settlement of refugees. The
negotiations with the League were protracted and the Geneva Protocol was
only signed in September 1923.18 The League scheme implemented in Greece
as a result was mainly confined to the settlement of refugees.

The period that followed the Asia Minor campaign is characterised by political
and monetary instability.19 One short-lived government after another assumed
control of the country until June 1925, when General Pangalos with the help of
a few officers seized power and established a dictatorship. Fourteen months
later, General Pangalos was himself overthrown by a military coup d’état
organised by another officer, General Condylis. Condylis immediately declared
himself in favour of a return to normal political conditions by holding
parliamentary elections. In December 1926 and for the first time since 1915,
Venizelists and Anti-Venizelists, Republicans and Monarchists co-operated and
formed a coalition government. The priority that united these politicians, in
spite of their deep-rooted differences, was the stabilisation of the drachma, the
Greek currency having lost approximately 95 per cent of its pre-war value by
mid-December 1926.
In the Spring of 1927 the Greek authorities resorted to the League of Nations
for a second time to obtain an international loan under its auspices to stabilise
the drachma and to continue the work of settling the refugees. The
reconstruction scheme prepared by the Financial Committee was a typical
League stabilisation plan, comprising as it did institutional reforms focused
mainly on the central banking system and the flotation of an international loan.
In the Greek example, however, there was a domestic twist on the League’s
norms; reorganisation of the issuing bank in Greece, as recommended by the
Financial Committee, led to the establishment of a fully-fledged central bank
de novo. The Bank of Greece opened its doors for business on 14th May 1928,
two days after the drachma was de jure stabilised.20

3. Overview of the Data
Three time series, each representing a Greek Government loan denominated in
gold and traded on the London market, the most important borrowing market
for the Greek government in the 1920s, have been compiled. All three loans
were issued after the establishment of the International Financial Commission.
They are known as the Railways Loan, the Bonds Loan and the Refugee Loan,
the latter floated in late 1924.21 In addition, data has been collected on the
British consol as a default-free government loan in order to construct time
series for Greek sovereign risk. The three Greek government loans concerned
are presented in Table 1.
In spite of the economic and monetary turmoil in the country, the Greek
government serviced its debt obligations throughout the period in question here
according to the terms and conditions laid down at the outset. In fact, both the
Railways and the Refugee loans were under the direct control of a nineteen
century institution, the International Financial Commission, which was
responsible for servicing the loans under its care. The International Financial
Commission (I.F.C.) was an international body, established in 1898 under the
Law of Control that was introduced following the Greek government’s default
in 1893. Its members were originally appointed by the governments of Great
Britain, France, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy and Russia.22 This
Commission assumed responsibility for servicing the Greek public debt that
was placed under its jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Greek government assigned
21 Greek public debt denominated in gold and traded on stock exchanges during the period in question can be divided into three categories. The first category consists of the ‘Old Loans’ as the loans contracted before the introduction of the Law of Control in 1898 are known. The second category includes loans that were issued after 1898 and placed under the aegis of the International Financial Commission. Finally, the third category comprises of loans that were not issued under the supervision of the I.F.C. The interest rate paid each year on the ‘Old Loans’ fluctuated between the minimum rate defined by the Law of Control and the original nominal interest rate of the loan. For this reason no loans issued before 1898 have been included here. For more information on the loans issued before 1898 see Christodoulaki and Penzer (2004, pp. 15-16 and p. 60).
22 After 1921, the I.F.C. was confined to members from Great Britain, France and Italy.

The flotation of the Railways Loan was authorised by law in 1900 and was
aimed at the construction and running of a railway from Piraeus to Demerly.
The sum authorised was 2,250,000 pounds sterling. In the end a total of
£2,183,280 was issued at a four per cent interest rate. A first tranche of the loan
was issued in March 1902 at 831⁄2 per cent and later, in June 1904, a second was
floated at 84 per cent.24
This was the first attempt by the Greek government to raise capital from the
international financial markets since the introduction of the Law of Control in

1898. Therefore, it was placed under the direct control of the I.F.C. and special
attention was paid to the guarantees assigned. The Railways Loan was
redeemable at par over a period of ninety eight years in tranches drawn by lot
every six months or by purchase in the open market, if the price was below par.
The Greek government reserved the right to pay off all outstanding bonds at par
at any time on six months’ notice.
The Bonds Loan was authorised by the Law of 19th March 1910. Its interest
rate was four per cent and was redeemable at par in fifty years by lot twice a
year commencing in 1912 or by purchase when the price was below par. The
Greek government could increase the sinking fund or pay off all or part of the
loan at par after January 1921 on at least three months’ notice. Although this
loan was secured by the surplus of tax revenues assigned to the I.F.C. it was not
placed under their direct control.25
The Refugee Loan was issued under the auspices of the League of Nations late
in 1924. This loan was raised to provide funds for the resettlement of refugees
who came to the country after the Asia Minor debacle. A special body, the
Refugee Settlement Commission, was established to administer the proceeds of
this loan. The Refugee Settlement Commission was an autonomous body, its
statutes having been developed by the Financial Committee of the League of
Nations and it was under the strict supervision of the League Council.26 The
total sum issued was £12,300,000. The price at issue was 88 per cent in London
and New York and 86 per cent in Athens.27 A substantial part of the loan
(£7,500,000) was issued in London. The rest was floated in almost equal parts
in Athens and New York.

The Refugee Loan was under the direct control of the International Financial
Commission.28 Principal was repayable at par over a period of forty years by
ballot every six months commencing September 1925.29 The Greek
government could increase its redemption after May 1936. It could also pay off
the Refugee Loan on giving three months’ prior notice.
Moody’s Manual of Investments which at the time furnished investors with ‘a
key to the relative security and stability of particular investment bonds’ valued
the Refugee Loan as a safer investment than the other two Greek loans
examined. Under their system of ratings, the Refugee Loan had a ‘Baa’ rating
whilst the Railways Loan and the Bonds Loan had a ‘Ba’.30
All the time series compiled for this paper are composed of daily observations
collected by hand from sources extensively used by contemporaneous market
participants to assess the creditworthiness of the Greek government. The
Railways and the Bonds Loan data come from The Times whilst the source of
the Refugee Loan data is the Stock Exchange Daily Official List.31 They
represent each day’s final transaction as a percentage of par value. It should be
noted that this is the first time that time series of daily data of Greek
government bonds have been compiled and presented in such a systematic
way.32
The Refugee Loan time series employed starts on 29th April 1925, the first day
that this loan was traded on the London Stock Exchange and finishes on 31st
28 For the revenues assigned for the service of this loan see The Stock Exchange Year-Book (1928, pp. 146-7); The Stock Exchange Official Intelligence (1928, pp. 124-5); Corporation of Foreign Bondholders (1926, pp. 202-3).

32 The first time that market prices of Greek government loans were presented in a systematic way was in Christodoulaki and Penzer (2004) where monthly data for three government loans namely the Monopoly Loan, the Bonds Loan and the 1914 Loan covering the period 1914 to 1929 and daily data of the Refugee Loan from 1925 until 1929 are analysed. Previous references in the literature to market prices of Greek government loans traded on the London Stock Exchange had been sporadic and failed to paint a fair picture of the period to which they refer. See for example Lazaretou (2005, pp. 229-30); Kostis (2003, p. 216); and Pepelasis Minoglou (1993, p. 73).

December 1929. By contrast with all other Greek loans traded on the London
market, this loan was traded every day that the London Stock Exchange was
open during the entire period in question. In fact, if the number of transactions
that took place each day is used as a yardstick, then the seven per cent Greek
Refugee Loan was one of the most popular loans on the London market.
The Railways Loan attracted investors’ interest more than any other Greek loan
issued before 1914. However, neither the Railways nor the Bonds loans were
traded every working day of the London Stock Exchange during the period in
question. See Table 6 in the Appendix for the total number of days each year
that these two loans were traded on the London market. Therefore, for the
period between 1914 and April 1925 when trading of the Refugee Loan
commenced, two Greek loans, the Railways and the Bonds Loan, have been
employed to examine how news influenced investors’ expectations of the
default risk of the Greek government. For the remaining period up to the end of
December 1929 the Refugee Loan has been used. The three time series are
plotted on Figures 1 and 2. On 30th July 1914 the outbreak of the First World
War caused the London Stock Exchange to close and business was not resumed
until early January 1915. Therefore the statistical analysis of the Railways Loan
begins in January 1915 and finishes in April 1925.33
The analysis of the Bonds Loan starts even later in March 1917 (as there was
no trading activity between April 1914 and February 1917) and ends in April
1925.34
British consols have been used as default free bonds to construct time series of
Greek sovereign risk. The time series of consols is composed of daily
observations, which again represent the final transaction as a percentage of par
value. They have been collected by hand from the same sources used for the
33 To be specific the analysis of the Railways Loan covers the period between 21st January 1915 and 28th April 1925. In total during this period there are 571 observations available.
34 There was trade in the Bonds Loan in the early months of 1914 although it was infrequent. The analysis of the Bonds Loan starts on 19th March 1917 and finishes on 27th April 1925. During this period as Table 6 in Appendix I shows, the Bonds Loan was traded on the London Stock Exchange on 361 days.

Greek government loans.35 Special attention was paid to ensuing that the Greek
loan and the matched consols were transactions that took place on the same
date.

The sovereign risk can be defined as the yield differential between government
bonds and the British consol or alternatively as a ratio of the yield of a
government loan and the British consol. In the statistical analysis employed
here the ratio of the yield of the Greek government bonds and the British
consol has been used. There are, however, references to sovereign risk as a
yield differential, since it illustrates investors’ expectations of Greek
government default risk more vividly. Both the Greek bonds’ and the consols’
yield was calculated by dividing the coupon rate by the market price. This is
the best approximation of yield for bonds with an amortisation period of
between forty and ninety eight years. More importantly, repayment of the

principal of all the three loans concerned was made by ballot twice a year and
purchase of bonds of the Railways and the Bonds loans was also possible if the
market price was below par value.
Archival material shows that policymakers in Greece observed the market price
movements of the 1914 Loan and the Bonds Loan in order to evaluate the
country’s creditworthiness on the London market.36 It also reveals that the
National Bank of Greece, possibly in co-operation with the government,
attempted to manipulate the market prices of Greek bonds twice during the
period in question.37 Certainly an organised intervention by the National Bank
began in September 1924, three months before the flotation of the Refugee
Loan.38 A second intervention seems to have been planned to coincide with the
issue of the Stabilisation Loan in January 1928.39 The information available on
these two market adjustments is summarised in Table 2.

4. Detecting Breakpoints
Banerjee, Lumsdaine & Stock (1992)40 propose a sequential four-step
procedure for detecting structural breakpoints in time series data. This method
essentially involves fitting autoregressive models in a moving window and
identifying breaks sequentially. This four-step technique and its variations
have been used in a growing number of papers which use historical time series
to identify structural changes.41 This structural break detection process,
however, involves some rather arbitrary choices including the order of the
autoregression and the width of the window.
The method applied here to detect breakpoints in the time series of Greek
sovereign risk was developed in Cho & Fryzlewicz (2011),42 which differs
from the Banerjee, Lumsdaine & Stock four-step technique mainly in that it
does not involve a subjective choice of window size.
4.1. Railways Loan Time Series Analysis
The Railways Loan dataset used covers the period from 21st January 1915 to
28th April 1925, though trading was uneven during this period with
transactions occurring on 571 days out of a possible 3,060. The concatenation
of the available data points is treated as the dataset in our analysis below.
Denote the time series of length T=571 as {X⤰}⤰⢀⡩
⤄ . Since X⤰ is a time series
with a very high degree of autocorrelation (which makes it challenging to
detect breakpoints in its mean or trend), we first difference X⤰, which reduces
the autocorrelation, and look for changes in its variance by observing the
behaviour of the ‘local’ variance estimate Y⤰ = (X⤰⡸⡩ − X⤰)⡰/2. See Figure 3,
40 Banerjee, Lumsdaine and Stock (1992).
41 Among the papers that have adopted this four-step technique are the following: Grossman and Imai (2009); Burdekin (2006); Frey and Waldenstrom (2004); Oosterlinck (2003); Mauro, Sussman and Yafeh (2002); Brown Jr (2002); Brown Jr and Burdekin (2000); Frey and Kucher (2000a); Frey and Kucher (2000b); Sussman and Yafeh (2000); Wells and Wills (2000); Willard, Guinnane and Rosen (1996).

where X⤰ and Y⤰ are compared. In a simple example, suppose for a moment that
X⡩ and X⡰ are two independent random variables satisfying X⤙ = μ + σε⤙ with
independent and identically distributed ε⤙ from a standard normal distribution.
Then we have
σ⡰ = ᡴᡓᡰ(ᡐ〒) = ᠱ(ᡐ⡰ − ᡐ⡩)⡰/2,
i.e. the unknown mean of ᡐ〒 is cancelled out by taking the difference between
ᡐ〒 and σ⡰ which can be estimated by (ᡐ⡰ − ᡐ⡩)⡰/2.

In reducing the problem of detecting breakpoints in the variance of X⤰ to
detecting those in the expectation of Y⤰, the CUSUM-type breakpoint detection
procedure from Cho & Fryzlewicz (2011) is applied to Y⤰.43
The procedure was developed for detecting breakpoints in a multiplicative
model of the following form
ᡑぇ= ...ぇ⡰,〡 ∙ ‵ぇ⡰, t=1, ... , T, (1)
where σ⤰⡰,⤄ is a piecewise constant sequence (which corresponds to the
expectation of Y⤰) and {ε⤰}⤰⢀⡩
⤄ are (possibly correlated) standard normal
variables.
The first step of the procedure is to find the most likely location for a
breakpoint. We locate such a point among b∈{1, ..., T-1} as the one which
maximises the following:
ↁ⡩〩,〡 = 䜘㒖ᡆ − ᡔ
T ∙ b 㔳 ᡑぇ
〩

ぇ〩⢀⡩ − ⡩
〡⡹〩 ∑ ᡑぇ
ぇ〡⢀〩⡸⡩ 䚘.
where Y⡩⤒,⤄ is interpreted as the difference between the local means of Y⤰ over
the two segments {1, ..., b} and {b+1, ..., T}, adjusted by a multiplicative
factor of the form 㒕(⤄⡹⤒)∙ ⤒
⤄ . This factor is chosen so that, in the ideal case of
Y⤰ being i.i.d. random variables, the variance of Y⡩⤒,⤄ remains constant over b.
Similar CUSUM statistics have been adopted in the context of breakpoint
detection, such as in Brodsky & Darkhovsky (1993), Venkatraman (1993) and
Inclán & Tiao (1994), to name but three.44 However, one chief difference

between the aforementioned and Cho & Fryzlewicz (2011) is that, in the latter
{ε⤰}⤰⢀⡩
⤄ can be autocorrelated.
Once it is found that 㕒b∈{1, ..., T} as where Y⡩⤒,⤄ is maximised, i.e.
ᡔ㕒 = ᡓᡰᡙᡥᡓᡶ〩 ↁ⡩〩,〡,
then Y⡩㕓⤒,⤄ can be used to test the null hypothesis of σ⤰⡰,⤄ being constant over
t∈{1, ..., T}. In Cho & Fryzlewicz (2011), the test statistic and its critical
value are designed in such a way that, if a breakpoint is present in a given
interval, the null hypothesis is rejected with probability converging to 1. If the
null hypothesis is rejected, the simultaneous locating and testing of breakpoints
is repeated separately on the two segments to the left and right of 㕒b, i.e. {Y⤰}⤰⢀⡩
㕓⤒
and {Y⤰}⤰⢀㕓⤒⡸⡩
⤄ , in a recursive manner until no further breakpoints are detected.
When breakpoint detection is complete, a post-processing procedure follows,
so as to further equip the testing procedure with an extra step aimed at reducing
the risk of overestimating the number of breakpoints. That is, at each
breakpoint, the CUSUM test statistic of the same form as in (2) is re-calculated
over the segment defined by its two adjacent breakpoints and compared with
the test criterion again. It is shown in Cho & Fryzlewicz (2011) that the
combined use of the CUSUM test and a post-processing step correctly detects
both the total number and the locations of breakpoints under the multiplicative
model (1) with probability approaching one.
When the procedure described above was applied to Y⤰, it returned t=25 (28
March 1916), t=143 (26 March 1920), t=338 (7 February 1923) and t=475 (19
May 1924) as breakpoints, in the sense that they each represent the end point of
a segment over which the variance of X⤰ was constant. The right hand panel of
Figure 3 shows the local variance of X⤰ estimated as the local mean over each
stationary segment (σ㕉⤰⡰,⤄).

4.2. Bonds Loan Time Series Analysis
The Bonds Loan time series for the period in question begins on 19th March
1917 and finishes on 27th April 1925 and provides only 361 observations out
of approximately 2,540 data points, which again are not equally spaced. We
applied the same approach to its analysis as to the Railways Loan time series.
Figure 4 compares X⤰ and Y⤰, and the estimated local variance of X⤰ (= σ㕉⤰⡰,⤄) is
represented by the bold solid line. The breakpoints obtained are presented in
Table 5.

4.3. Refugee Loan Time Series Analysis
The Refugee Loan time series offers a complete dataset with 1,180
observations covering the period from 29th April 1925 until 31st December
1929. Due to its particular statistical features described below, the Refugee
Loan dataset was analysed differently from the previous two time series.
Removing the regular spikes
A key feature of the Refugee Loan daily time series is its biannual spikes.
Figure 5 which is a plot of the difference in the time series represented
by {X⤰⡸⡩ − X⤰}⤰⢀⡩
⤄⡹⡩, captures graphically these biannual spikes which occur on
the last day of each April and October that the London Stock Exchange was
open. See also Table 3 where the spikes identified are presented.

The difference is explained by the turmoil that the Great Crash on the New York stock exchange created on the international financial markets. Nevertheless, it is important to note that even if t=1141 is included in the statistical analysis as a spike the outcome remains identical.

These biannual spikes in the Refugee Loan time series coincide with coupon
payments and redemption of bonds drawn by lot. From 1st May and 1st
November each year coupons were paid off at Hambros Bank in London,
whilst at the same time bonds drawn by lot for redemption could be
redeemed.45 Consequently, these biannual, regularly spaced spikes have been
removed from the dataset before any further analysis is carried out.
Detecting breakpoints in the variance
After the spikes have been removed from the dataset of the Refugee Loan, the
breakpoints in the variance of X⤰ are detected by applying the CUSUM-type
testing procedure to Y⤰ = (X⤰⡸⡩ − X⤰)⡰/2 . As a result, two breakpoints are
returned at t=47 (6th July 1925) and t=1123 (7th October 1929). See Figure 6
and Table 5 below where these two breakpoints are presented.
Subsequently, these breakpoints are used to estimate the local variance
of X⤰(σ⤰⡰,⤄) as the local mean over each stationary segment (σ㕉⤰⡰,⤄). Finally, this
estimate is used to compute the ‘variance-stabilised’ version of X⤰,

45 Draws of bonds of the Refugee Loan took place in Athens twice a year in March and September, commencing in September 1925. The numbers drawn were announced in the press including British newspapers, so that repayment could be make at par after 1st May and 1st November respectively each year.

Removing the linear trend from the data
As can be seen in the left-hand panel of Figure 7, there is a strong downward
linear trend in Z⤰ as obtained in (3). Indeed, the outcome from performing
simple linear regression over time shows that there is a significant linear trend
in Z⤰. See also Table 4. Therefore, the trend is removed from Z⤰ and the
residuals after de-trending are denoted by z⤰. See the right-hand panel of
Figure 7.

autocorrelation (pacf) functions are plotted in Figure 8. The acf on the left

hand panel shows that z⤰ may be well explained by an autoregressive (AR)
process of order 2.

To confirm this observation, an AR(2) process was fitted to z⤰; the residuals
comfortably passed the Ljung-Box test for lack of serial correlation. Therefore,
we concluded that no further systematic pattern was present in the data.
To summarise, the Refugee Loan time series of sovereign risk has regular
upward spikes which appear biannually, and once those spikes are removed, the
remaining dataset provides two breakpoints in the variance, on 6th July 1925
and 7th October 1929 respectively. When the variance of the data is stabilised,
there is a strong downward linear trend in the data, and once the linear trend is
removed, the residuals can be modelled as an AR(2) process. Since the final
residuals are well-explained by a stationary AR(2) process, it is implied that
there are no further structural breakpoints to be detected from the Refugee
Loan time series.

5. Breakpoints and Historical Events
Table 5 presents the breakpoints detected by the statistical analysis of the three
Greek sovereign risk time series employed here. The second column of this
table refers to the historical events that correlate in time with the breakpoints
identified.
The two time series of sovereign risk analysed here, those relating to the
Railways and Bonds loans respectively, which cover the period between 1914
and April 1925 as shown by Figures 1 and 2, present a consistent picture of the
period in question in spite of some differences. The statistical analysis confirms
this discrepancy in the behaviour of the two loans. This difference in the
behaviour of the two loans could be a ‘guide to the labyrinth’46 of Greek public
debt whilst at the same time demonstrating the complexity of the markets. It is
consistent with the efficient market hypothesis, in particular with the weaker
form of this hypothesis.47
The discrepancy in the behaviour of the two loans could be explained by their
different attributes, some of which are not always readily apparent. For
example, the seniority sequence in the service of these two loans was
dissimilar: the Railways Loan was under the direct control of the I.F.C. but the
Bonds Loan, despite being secured by public revenues assigned to the
Commission, was not placed under their direct control. Knowing the identity of
the ultimate buyers and sellers of Greek government bonds on the London
Stock Exchange would also shed light on why there is a discrepancy in the
behaviour of the two time series.

Both time series demonstrate that during the First World War Greek sovereign
risk remained low. The Asia Minor campaign, acting perhaps as a proxy of
fiscal performance, prompted a continuous increase in the risk premium of
Greek government debt. By the end of the Asia Minor campaign, Greek
sovereign risk had rocketed, reflecting the debacle and its aftermath in a
striking fashion. In early 1923, as both loans’ datasets show, risk premium
started falling and the statistical analysis of the Refugee Loan country risk time
series reveals a strong linear downward trend in this dataset. By the end of the
period in question, Greek country risk had decreased considerably but still
remained higher than it had been at the beginning of 1914.


29
The statistical analysis of the three daily time series examined here shows that
investors acted upon news of fiscal performance and public debt developments.
Political events and in particular unanticipated political changes also influenced
bondholders’ behaviour. By contrast, institutional innovations, such as the
adoption of the Gold Exchange Standard and the establishment of a central
bank de novo, did not produce any quantitative market response. Stabilisation
and the concomitant institutional reforms, however, did become factored into
the market price of Greek sovereign debt traded in London and consequently
Greek sovereign risk reduced.
Statistical analysis indicates that the two organised interventions of the
National Bank to manipulate market prices of Greek government bonds in
London, as described in Table 2, did not produce any statistically significant
market reaction that would indicate a change in the behaviour of market
participants. As Table 5 shows, no breakpoints were detected during the period
in which the National Bank attempted to improve the market price of Greek
sovereign debt and thus to influence the terms for further borrowing by the
Greek government on the London market. One of the two loans targeted by the
market interventions of the National Bank in the autumn of 1924 was the
Bonds Loan analysed here. It is, however, unlikely that the breakpoint detected
in mid-December 1924 by statistical analysis of the Bonds Loan sovereign risk
time series was triggered by market interventions. By then, not only had the
terms of the Refugee Loan been determined, but the loan itself had already
been issued.48
In the text that follows, the breakpoints detected by statistical analysis are
correlated with historical events that appear to have shaped investors’
behaviour on the London Stock Exchange.
48 The terms of the Refugee Loan were published on 4th December 1924, a fact that suggests that market interventions must have been terminated by that date. See The Times, ‘Terms of Greek Loan’, 4th December 1924. See also The Times, ‘Greek Government 7% Refugee Loan’, 8th December 1924.

5.1. Expectations and Reality: Political Rhetoric versus Market Forces
In 1916 deals in Greek government bonds on the London market were ‘rare’49
and did not ‘reflect the unsettled condition of politics’50 in Greece. Prices of
Greek government bonds were supported by purchases for the sinking fund and
by wealthy Greeks, in particular by those connected with the shipping
industry.51 The statistical analysis locates a breakpoint in the Railways Loan
sovereign risk time series between late March and early April 1916. However,
dealings on this loan were so sporadic throughout 1916 and at the same time
both the political and financial conditions in Greece were so complex, that it is
difficult to isolate the events that may have produced this breakpoint.
Jubilation at the victory in the Great War soon faded away. During the summer
of 1919, the first doubts about the presence of Greek troops in Asia Minor were
openly expressed particularly by France.52 In a report, prepared for the
Overseas Trade Department in Britain on the economic situation in Greece that
summer, reservations were expressed about the capacity of Greece to carry out
her financial obligations even if taxation was increased. This report was never
circulated, having provoked a strongly negative reaction from the Greek
government.
The two time series under scrutiny here show that sovereign risk began to
increase at the end of 1919 when there had ‘been [a] considerable reduction in
the quotations of Greek loans’ on the London market.53 The statistical analysis
of the Bonds Loan risk premium dataset displays a breakpoint early in January
1920 when an uncomfortable ‘discrepancy between revenue and expenditure’54
was disclosed, demonstrating a change in investors’ perceptions of the fiscal
health of the country in that month. The analysis of the country risk based on
the daily dataset of the Railways Loan locates a breakpoint approximately three

months later than the Bonds Loan, in late March 1920. Both these breakpoints
indicate that investors considered it a possibility as early as spring 1920 that the
Greek government would not be able to service its debt and at the same time
pursue its territorial aspirations in Asia Minor.
The Bonds Loan time series of sovereign yield spreads then displays a second
breakpoint in the middle of November 1920, which supports the conventional
historiography. The timing of this breakpoint coincides with political
developments in Greece described in Section 2, that the political historiography
views as crucial to the course of history on the Asia Minor front and economic
history literature sees as central in explaining the slide of the drachma.
Geopolitical changes in the area created ‘uncertainty as to the measure in which
the [Greek] national claims [would] be satisfied’.55 This uncertainty coupled
with the economic and military capacity of Greece to sustain its presence in
Asia Minor stimulated the sustained upward trend in Greek sovereign risk on
the London Stock Exchange.
5.2. The Debacle
Figures 1 and 2 demonstrate graphically why Greek governments faced great
difficulties, beyond the politics and embargoes referred to in the literature, in
raising capital on the financial markets to finance the Asia Minor campaign.
After 1919, Greek government bonds sustained their downward trend and
consequently the risk premium on Greek government debt rocketed, reflecting
the decreased credibility of the Greek government as a borrower on the London
market. The Economist repeatedly reassured holders of Greek government
bonds that, although the situation in Athens was critical both financially and
politically, there was no reason to suppose that this would affect the servicing
of public debt.56 Market signals were also encouraging to investors. In 1920

the I.F.C. paid bondholders of Greek loans issued before the 1893 default
which were under its supervision, their full contractual interest rate for the first
time since the introduction of the Law of Control.57
The Asia Minor campaign ended disastrously for Greece in the late summer of
1922. The effect of this outcome, along with the political changes in the
country that followed the military defeat, is illustrated dramatically in the
sovereign yield spreads as expressed by the two time series employed here. The
statistical analysis of the Bonds Loan time series detects a breakpoint in
October 1922 during a period when ‘Greek bonds remained out of favour’ at
the London Stock Exchange.58 This breakpoint reflects the precarious financial
situation in Athens. A military convention signed at Mudania provided for the
evacuation of the Greek population from Eastern Thrace.59 Approximately two
hundred thousand people had to leave the area for Greece ‘in a short space of
time’.60 ‘Sheltering and feeding’ over a million refugees whilst sustaining the
‘financial needs of the Treasury’ were the most pressing problems that the
Revolutionary Committee faced at the time.61
Clearly developments on the Asia Minor front had a decisive influence on the
value of the country’s sovereign bonds traded in London. Political
developments in the country and the determination that the Revolutionary
Committee showed in handling domestic issues had a strong impact on
investors’ confidence in the creditworthiness of the Greek government on the
London market. The value on the London market of the Bonds Loan, for
example, fell to as low as 16 per cent of face value on 1st December 1922,
demonstrating a dramatic decrease in public confidence in the Greek

government.62 This market value of the Bonds Loan amounted to a sovereign
risk of nearly 21 per cent, a country risk indicating a government approaching
bankruptcy.63
5.3. Credibility, Commitment and Institutions: Market Reception
Figures 1 and 2 clearly show that late in 1922 market actors believed that the
Greek government was approaching default. By contrast, none of the Greek
governments of the period, despite the difficulties they encountered in
financing public expenditure, considered default an option. The humiliation of
the military defeat in 1922, combined with the transaction costs and the
embarrassment of the 1893 default that still loomed large in politicians’ minds
in Athens, as well as the belief that foreign aid would be forthcoming, led
governments to opt for other, often controversial, measures to cover
expenditure rather than ceasing to honour their interest-bearing obligations.64
Even the Revolutionary Committee ‘though they had not flinched at taking the
lives of six of Greece’s most prominent citizens, astonished the world by the
subsequent moderation ... of their rule’65 and did not behave differently.
Both time series of sovereign risk examined here present a breakpoint in early
February 1923. These breakpoints and in particular that of the Railways Loan
time series, since it is the first breakpoint of this dataset located after March
1920, denote the end of a long period marked by the events that led to the Asia
Minor debacle. It is possible that these breakpoints in early February 1923
reflect developments on the diplomatic front. On 30th January 1923, a
convention was signed in Lausanne between Greece and Turkey for the
compulsory exchange of populations between the two countries. In addition,
62 For the dramatic events that had occurred in Athens three days before see Yanoulopoulos (1999, pp. 297-303); History of the Greek Nation (1978, pp. 255-9); Daphnes (1955, pp. 10-20); and Morgenthau (1929, pp. 105-6).
63 The Railways Loan time series reached its highest point on 29th January 1923 indicating a yield spread of approximately ten per cent.

34
the Greek government tried to improve its credibility by making positive
statements in the London press about the fiscal position of the country at a time
when it was searching for capital to finance the settlement of the refugees.66
Analysis of the Bonds Loan distinguishes it again from the Railways Loan and
presents a breakpoint in late December 1923 which reflects the political
developments in Greece that led to the return, albeit temporarily, of Venizelos
to the political arena.67
After unsuccessful attempts to raise capital on the international markets for the
rehabilitation of refugees, the Greek government turned to the League of
Nations for assistance. The news that an external loan was to be granted to
Greece under the auspices of the League, on behalf of the refugees, was first
announced to the public early in May 1923.68 It took a whole year, however,
before in May 1924 it was finally confirmed that the Greek Refugee Loan
would be floated in the following October or November. At the same time the
Bank of England consented to despatch a second advance for the continuation
of the settlement of the refugees until the flotation of the Loan.69 The
breakpoint that the analysis of the Railways Loan time series detects in May
1924, the last breakpoint that this series presents, coincides with these
developments as they related to the flotation of the Refugee Loan. It also
signifies the return of the country to the financial markets, for all that this
return was under the supervision of the League of Nations.
In the end, the terms and conditions of this loan were finalised and announced
early in December 1924. On 8th December subscription lists were opened in

London at 9:45 am but had to be ‘closed at about one minute past ten’ that
same morning and ‘hundreds of belated applications were excluded’.70 ‘The
actual result far outstripped the most optimistic expectations’,71 as the Greek
Refugee Loan was 21 times oversubscribed.72 The breakpoint located in the
Bonds Loan sovereign risk time series in the middle of December 1924
correlates with the success of the flotation of the Refugee Loan on the London
market as this encouraged ‘buying of some of the older Greek loans’.73
The euphoria created by the success of the Refugee Loan soon faded away. By
March 1925, it was apparent that the proceeds of this loan would not be
sufficient to complete the resettlement of the refugees.74 In March 1925, the
Bonds Loan time series presents the last breakpoint detected by statistical
analysis. There is no obvious reason that would explain this change in the
Bonds Loan time series other than that it was by then evident that the
settlement of the refugees would be a more costly operation than had been
anticipated.
The Refugee Loan sovereign risk time series employed to provide insight into
the way that investors reacted to news from May 1925 until the end of 1929
shows that two statistically significant market responses resulted. A breakpoint
is detected at the beginning of this period, early in July 1925 and a second one
occurs nearly at the end of the period under scrutiny here, early in October
1929. See also Table 5. The breakpoint located early in July 1925 was
produced by unexpected political events in Athens.75 The news of a coup d’état
on 25th June triggered ‘a sharp decline’ in the value of the Greek Refugee Loan
on the London market.76 By the time of the breakpoint a new government had

been formed and the Minister of Finance had already announced both the
economic policy and the aims of the new government.77 The policy adopted by
officials was to convince the financial markets that what had happened in
Athens was ‘a mere change of government’.78
The final breakpoint located in the time series occurs early in October 1929
when uncertainty had already begun to loom over the world’s stock exchanges.
This breakpoint might reflect developments related to new borrowing by the
Greek government, as described briefly in the last paragraph of this section.
The statistical analysis of the Refugee Loan time series does not reveal any
breakpoints between July 1925 and the implementation of a League of Nations
stabilisation plan in 1928. However, it is apparent as Figure 1 shows, that
eventual stabilisation and the concomitant institutional reforms had already
been factored into the market value of the bonds and consequently the
creditworthiness of the Greek government improved on the London market.
There are no breakpoints corresponding to events that the literature regards as
playing a significant role in achieving monetary stability: that is to say the
elections of November 1926, settlement of war debts with Great Britain,79
resorting to the League of Nations in 1927, and finally the flotation of the
Stabilisation Loan in 1928. Crucially, there is no statistically significant change
that coincides with the establishment of the central bank and de jure
stabilisation of the drachma.
The central banking reforms and the adoption of the Gold Exchange Standard
in Greece in 1928 would hardly have taken investors by surprise.80 Both events

79 Pepelasis overemphasises the role of the settlement of the War Debts with Britain in opening the way to stabilisation. See Pepelasis Minoglou (1993).
80 Sussman and Yafeh (2000) argue that in contrast to innovations in Japan such as the establishment of the Bank of Japan in 1882, which failed to elicit an immediate market response, the adoption of the Gold Standard in 1897 did significantly reduce the perceived risk associated with Japanese bonds traded on the London Stock Exchange. They conclude that in sharp contrast to the Gold Standard, which was a well-understood economic rule, institutional changes were difficult to evaluate at the time


37
had been publicised in the press. In addition, there was generally a lengthy time
span between the initial, possibly informal, announcement and the
promulgation of the reforms. Statements about the Greek government’s
intention to stabilise the drachma appeared in the British press as early as July
192581 and the matter was frequently in the news up to the de jure
stabilisation.82 The formal announcement and the timing of de jure stabilisation
of the drachma close to its market value were therefore anticipated by market
participants. The drachma had been de facto stabilised for a whole year before
May 1928 and the monetary authorities as well as government officials
involved, advocated at every opportunity legal stabilisation without
‘revalorisation’.83
News about possible central banking reforms in Greece appeared in the British
press on the same day that the Greek representatives in Geneva officially asked
the Council to authorise a stabilisation loan for Greece. The Financial News of
15th June reported that, under the League’s scheme, the National Bank of
Greece ‘would be transformed into an issue bank and would engage a foreign
advisor’.84 Some of these central banking reforms would in any event have
been anticipated by the markets, as they were an integral part of all the League
sponsored reconstruction schemes that had preceded the Greek stabilisation
plan. Three weeks later, The Economist published a long article on the
negotiations between Greek officials and the Financial Committee of the
League. It was reported that a prerequisite for the flotation of a League
sponsored loan was that the Greek parliament authorise ‘the gradual conversion
and therefore had no effect on the London market’s perception of Japanese debt. The few reports in the press on these institutional changes in Japan did not help to win investors’ confidence as credible signs of development or of the government's ability to repay its foreign debt. The swift reduction, however, in the risk premium at the time of the introduction of the Gold Standard in Japan, so vividly illustrated in Figure 1 of their article and detected by statistical analysis, could be attributed to the debt restructuring that took place to facilitate the financial and monetary reform endorsed by the Coinage Law of 1897.

of the National Bank of Greece into a central bank of issue of modern type’.85
By that time, however, not only had the manner of central banking reform in
Greece been agreed upon, but the statutes of the new bank of issue had been
drafted.86 Discussions between the Greek side and the representatives of the
League were difficult, as there was a fundamental disagreement over the way
central banking reforms should be implemented in the country.87
The architects of reform at first withheld news of the establishment of the Bank
of Greece and then manipulated the way in which the news was released. The
first reference to the creation of a new central bank appeared in the Greek press
as an option under consideration on 17th July, the day that the Ministers of
Finance and Foreign Affairs returned to Athens.88 The first public
announcements by the Minister of Finance to the press stated clearly that two
plans were being considered and that the government was thinking of either
transforming ‘the National Bank into a pure bank of issue by transferring all its
other functions to another bank’ or of forming ‘a new independent bank of
issue’.89 By early August 1927, details of the sweeping reforms had been made
public, as had the opposition of the leader of the Populist Party to the
arrangements laid down by the Geneva Protocol. As a result, the Populist Party
withdrew from the coalition government objecting to the establishment of a
new, fully-fledged central bank. Political opposition did not endanger the
reforms however. A reshuffled government brought the stabilisation plan to
parliament, which in the absence of the Populist Party ratified it the following
December. Previously, the Council of the League had approved the scheme in
its September session.
85 The Economist, 9th July, 1927. The League’s requirement that the National Bank be re-organised to operate as a central bank of issue and maintain the stable value of the drachma was also acknowledged.

The London press reported developments in Athens as they unfolded.90 A
statistically significant market reaction might be expected, reflecting the
announcement of the imminent establishment of the Bank of Greece. In fact,
statistical analysis of the daily observations of the Refugee Loan shows that
financial market actors’ behaviour was not dramatically influenced by the
news. Market prices of Greek government bonds, however, did respond to the
information available. Bond prices drifted gradually upwards as news of
institutional changes in Athens reached the market and consequently, as Figure
1 illustrates, the spread between the yield of the Refugee Loan and the British
consol steadily declined.
The political authorities expected that institutional developments resulting in
the establishment of a central bank and the adoption of the Gold Exchange
Standard would facilitate an influx of foreign capital essential for economic
growth. However, the impact of these institutional reforms, at least in the short
term, on the cost and of course the volume of Greek borrowing ‘should reflect
external circumstances as well’.91 By May 1928 the Greek government had
over-borrowed and the international economy was about to enter the most
severe depression ever experienced. A few months after Greece adopted the
Gold Exchange Standard, in December 1928, a loan for public works with a
nominal value of four million pounds was issued on the London market, on
similar terms to those of the Stabilisation Loan. Only one third of this loan was
covered. A month later, in January 1929, the Greek government signed an
agreement with Seligman & Co for a loan with a nominal value of up to 54
million dollars.92 The agreement provided for the flotation of a loan on terms
similar to the Stabilisation Loan on the condition that the I.F.C. would assume

responsibility for its service. Seligman would take responsibility for any part of
the loan that remained uncovered. On 30th October 1929 the Evening Standard
announced the cancellation of this loan.93 The official reason for the
termination of this agreement was that the I.F.C. had refused to assume
responsibility for the service of this loan.94 The timing of the termination of the
agreement, however, is more revealing than the official announcement.
6. Conclusion
In this paper three daily time series of sovereign risk have been compiled using
Greek government loans denominated in gold and traded on the London Stock
Exchange, benchmarked against the British consol and analysed statistically.
The aim has been to shed light on historical events, including political and
institutional developments that shaped investors’ expectations of the capacity
of the Greek government to honour its debt obligations between the outbreak of
the First World War and the advent of the Great Depression. Thus this work
contributes to the literature that explores the way that historical events,
including institutional changes, interact with capital markets to determine asset
prices.
The daily time series of Greek sovereign risk analysed here demonstrate that
during the Great War, country risk remained low. Subsequently, however, the
value of Greek bonds traded on the London Stock Exchange decreased
dramatically in response to developments in Asia Minor and consequently the
risk premium soared. News relating to the military campaign in Asia Minor
became a proxy for fiscal performance. In early 1923, the Greek default risk
started falling slowly and by the end of the period in question it had dropped

considerably reflecting the improvement in the creditworthiness of the Greek
government on the London market.
It is a genuine challenge, using advanced statistical analysis, to attempt to
understand what caused changes in investors’ behaviour during such a complex
historical period. The sovereign risk time series, analysed statistically here,
clearly show that investors acted upon news of fiscal performance and public
debt developments. Political events and in particular political changes that had
not been anticipated also influenced the behaviour of investors’ in Greek
government debt.
Institutional innovations such as de jure adoption of the Gold Exchange
Standard and the establishment of a central bank de novo did not produce any
quantitative market reaction. Formal announcements on institutional changes
such as the adoption of the Gold Exchange Standard and the establishment of a
central bank were unlikely to contain new information. These reforms generally
take a long time to be promulgated and need to be ratified by parliament.
Market actors observed and evaluated every step taken towards stabilisation
carefully. As a result, stabilisation and the concomitant institutional reforms
were gradually factored into the market price of Greek sovereign debt traded in
London. The credibility of the Greek government on the London market
improved and consequently the cost of capital was lowered.
