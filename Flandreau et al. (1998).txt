SUMMARY
The gold standard was a system of fixed exchange rates that ofered little
opportunity for carrying out monetary policies, short of suspending gold
convertibility. Trade integration and capital mobility were very high. It is
worthwhile asking whether there are useful lessons to draw for EMUfrom
European experience during that period. One clear lesson is that debts matter.
Another basic finding is that the stability of the European gold standard
depended on the underlying price trend. Deflation prior to 1895 resulted in
rising public debt burdens, which forced some countries to leave the system.
Once gold was discovered and deflation gave way to inflation, real interest
servicefell, debts grew more slowly and a high degree of convergence allowed
most countries to return to gold. For EMU, this result implies that stability
will hinge on the ECB's policy not being too restrictive. Other lessons concern
the fragility of institutions in the face of deep public finance diffculties, the
risks for the single market of leaving out countries that have not fully
converged, and the existence of a virtuous cycle including low real interest
rates, fast growth and debt reduction.

mechanisms that substituted for our modern formal criteria. This traditional
interpretation, which dates back to the interwar years, sees the classical gold
standard as a coherent system of rules and policies. (For critiques of this view, se
Bloomfield (1959) and Triffin (1964); for links with current debates in Europe, see
Eichengreen and Flandreau (1997).) Recent work has refined this interpretation by
specifying the nature of restraints.
A first view emphasizes the political mechanism. Gallarotti (1995) stresses that the
ruling European bourgeoisie wanted stable prices and exchange rates over the long
run, because it held a large fraction of its wealth and pensions in the shape of fixed
interest domestic and foreign bonds. The conservative policies that preserved the
gold standard are seen as the by-product of the conservatism of elites. However, in a
democratic society, decision making must be transparent. Monetary stability canno
rest on an arrangement that empowers a specific interest group with the ability to set
fiscal or monetary targets. Formal rules are needed to prevent changes in politica
majorities resulting in fiscal misconduct. The Maastricht 'formal rules' approach
would be a democratic equivalent of the gold standard 'political' mechanism as a
way to deliver stability.
An alternative view emphasizes the market mechanism. According to Bordo and
Rockoff (1996), the gold standard rule worked as an incentive mechanism. Lender
monitored fiscal and monetary misconduct, using gold convertibility as a signal of
orthodox policies. Because leaving the gold standard implied higher interest rates,
each country had an incentive to adopt disciplined policies. Bordo and Rockoffs
point is that this mechanism was stabilizing because disciplined countries were
rewarded through lower interest rates: 'countries chose to join the gold standard
bloc, even though being on gold imposed restraint on their fiscal and monetary
behaviour'.' However, nothing in this reasoning is specific to the gold standard. The
same incentives should in principle exist under any regime: indeed, the modern
literature on financial markets discipline (Bishop et al., 1989) stresses that markets
perform the job of providing governments with appropriate incentives. Under this
view, therefore, the market mechanism will be an essential ingredient of stability in the euro zone.
The institutional and market mechanism views of the gold standard correspond to
two alternative perceptions of the requisites for a successful functioning of the euro
zone. This paper looks into the historical precedent of the gold standard to
determine whether lessons can be drawn for today's Europe. We begin with an
investigation of the record of the European gold standard (section 2). Our key
conclusion is that the gold standard comprised two subperiods. The first period,
starting in 1880, ended with a severe exchange crisis in the 1890s. The second
period began with exchange rate instability, but then evolved after the turn of the

monetary un burdens were found at levels that are close to current ones.
Section 5 looks at price movements that affected the opportunity cost of being
part of the gold standard. When prices were falling, debt service costs rose and
many debt-laden countries suspended gold convertibility. By contrast, countries
found it easier to participate in the gold standard when prices rose. To a large
extent, divergence and convergence within the gold area can be traced to trends in rates of inflation.
The conclusion sums up the evidence and discusses policy implications. In
particular, we suggest that stability will hinge on the ECB's policy not being too restrictive.

international financial centres'. Long-term capital also travelled rapidly. Large and

2.2. Gold pari gold standard
Participation in the gold club was not the outcome of any negotiation. A country
only needed to define a gold parity for its currency: that is, the quantity of pure gold
in national coins. As long as they effectively maintained convertibility (i.e., stood
ready to exchange their notes against coins), central banks indirectly pegged their
bilateral exchange rates vis-a-vis other gold convertible currencies within the so
called gold points. These may be thought of as target zones, whose centre coincided
with the official parity and whose bandwidth corresponded approximately to bullion
shipping charges between countries. This was the situation in countries like Britain,
France, Germany and the Netherlands. Other currencies, while not strictly
convertible, behaved as if they were pegged to gold, because the central bank held
foreign exchange reserves and used them to stabilize the exchange rate each time it
threatened to exit notional gold points. This was the case in Austria. In other
countries, such as Greece in the years immediately preceding the First World War,
the national currency was related to gold through what was essentially a currency board arrangement: domestic units were created on a one-for-one basis as a
counterpart of foreign exchange reserve holdings.
Since these measures were implemented at the country's convenience, they could
always be suspended without international agreement: the option was always
available to suspend convertibility, discontinue stabilizing foreign exchange interventions, or quit gold standard arrangements. In this case, the country was
effectively dropping off gold and its exchange rate could fluctuate. Historically, such
decisions tended to follow periods of crisis, during which money creation had been
large and capital inflows low, so that the amount of gold (or reserves) required to
settle the country's external obligations was larger than the quantity available in the
vaults of the central bank. Once offgold, countries found themselves effectively on a
paper standard with a floating exchange rate. The official gold parity represented a
floor for exchange rate appreciation, because the central bank that could not sell
gold against notes could still sell notes against gold. A country could either undertake
to return the exchange rate to its gold parity (a course adopted during the period
under study by Portugal, Greece, Italy and Spain), or bring the parity into line with
exchange depreciation, accepting a permanent devaluation (a course adopted by
Russia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire in the 1890s).
Figure 1 summarizes the spread of the gold standard in Europe. There is, of
course, a degree of arbitrariness in deciding where to put the boundary between

Figure 2 displays the evolution of European exchange rates in terms of end-ofperiod gold parity, so that a value above unity means the exchange rate is temporarily depreciated. The three key European currencies (sterling, franc and
Reichsmark) are excluded from the diagram because they remained within their
assigned gold points throughout the period. The general pattern exhibits a bell
shape. Nearly all exchange rates are located in a narrow 10% interval. The only
exception is Portugal, for which the depreciation was around 20%. For several
countries, depreciation was considerable during the 1890s and early 1900s, and was
followed by appreciation as the currencies returned to the gold standard.
The general pattern conceals three different groups. Small economies, such as

No view could be more distant from the concerns of economists in the 1890s and
1900s than the modern prejudice that central bank independence was the normal
state of affairs during the gold standard. In the years immediately preceding the First
World War, the protection of central banks against political pressures was indeed
high. However, this was perceived by contemporaries as being the result of a patient

Governments could extract seigniorage in two ways. They could force the central
bank to monetize the debt and they could directly circulate government notes
independently of the central bank. Following Cukierman's (1992) distinction between limitations on lending and ways to influence decisions, two features of
central banks' charters are of interest. Direct political control is linked to the
ownership of the bank (privately or state owned), the appointment of the board
(governor, sub-governor(s) and council), as well as rules governing the cover system.
Obviously, the greater the private sector ingredient in the decision-making process,
the more constrained was the government (Capie (1997) makes a similar point).
Indirect control rests on rules governing the government's right to obtain short-term
advances, to monetize securities, or to issue its own paper. One should not take a
nominalist view of such features. Statutes were not resources lying exclusively in the
hands of central bankers or governments. They were the endogenous outcome of
negotiations that codified state-bank relations when charters were drafted, and their adjustment over time followed, rather than preceded, actual changes in
underlying power relations. Leads and lags existed between printed norms and

3.5. Conclusion
It is clearly impossible to claim that central bank independence was the Europ
gold standard's recipe for monetary stability. Rather, poor exchange rate per
mance was associated with low levels of central bank independence. Much lik
today, contemporary observers concluded that central bank independence was
exogenous source of stability. Yet the evidence suggests that institutions we

Mediterranean central banks' statutes in the 1890s demonstrates that the prote
walls that appeared so safe in core countries could very well crumble. Event
efforts towards better protection of monetary authorities were in fact led

consolidations in Italy, Spain and Greece had not been imposed on the Treasury
a powerful central bank. Rather, the increased autonomy of the central ban
resulted from the Treasury's ability to balance its accounts, or in Russia and Austr
from the desire to accumulate gold reserves. In the next section, therefore, consider how constraints on debt accumulation might have influenced
exchange rate stability and central bank autonomy.

4.2. Estimation results
We use our panel of European countries to examine the link between indebted
and the cost of borrowing by regressing the spreads of government bond yields ov
a risk-free bond on the debt/GDP ratios. Our regressions also capture the effe
economic fundamentals that may influence debt sustainability. These include
exports/GDP ratio and levels of economic development measured by using re
GDP per head converted at PPP prices. We also included an 'on gold' varia
which takes the value 1 when the country is on gold in any given year, and z
otherwise. This variable may be interpreted as either capturing the additional effec
of market discipline in rewarding countries adhering to gold (the seal of appr
view) or reflecting a number of factors that were known to market participants, b which are not included in our data set and which were correlated with adherence to
the gold standard (e.g., political shocks).
The results of pooled cross-section regressions are shown in Table 6. We use
instrumental variables (see Appendix B for details) with explanatory variables
alternatively included in and excluded from the estimation. The results range from
the most parsimonious specifications (only debt ratios are included) to the most extensive ones (all exogenous variables are included). In all regressions, the
parameters are generally found statistically significant and their signs correspond to
economic intuition. The negative effect of per-capita income reflects the fact that
economic development is typically accompanied by a greater ability to tax, and
hence improved debt sustainability. The negative effect of openness captures the fact
that in nineteenth-century Europe, capital exporting countries were also the most
open ones. Open countries were usually capital lenders and had a greater ability to
retain foreign investment; hence they were better able to deal with external payment
problems (Bairoch, 1974). The signs of the debt and 'on gold' variables clearly fit
the previous discussions.
Judging from the fit (adjusted R2), the non-linear specifications (panels a and c) do
a better job than the linear specification (panel b). This conclusion can be rigorously
tested when comparing the 'rationing' and 'linear' specifications, since the latter can
be seen as imposing on the former the restriction that the 'debt rationing' coefficient
is zero. This restriction is clearly rejected. Additional tests presented in Appendix B
9This latter form of the market discipline hypothesis was applied to US states by Bayoumi et al. (1993). Their findings imply that American states are rationed at relatively low debt ratios, all below 10% of gross state product. These thresholds are far below what was observed under the gold standard, and far below current European debt levels. This suggests that the overall economic and institutional context in which US states accumulate debts is quite different from the European one, past, present and future.

6.5% to 1.5% in Germany, etc. Even without the contribution of improved growth
prospects, as inflation progressed, public debt sustainability improved, and the
default risks that sovereign borrowers faced declined. The acceleration of growth
that some countries experienced at the turn of the century helped further. However,
this tendency was perhaps less systematic than the effects of gold inflation. For
instance, growth was marked in Austria, Russia and Germany, but much less so in Britain and France.

This mechanism was amplified by the predominance of the long-term component in
European sovereign debts: the inertia of the interest service on this fraction of public
debts was the channel through which price movements affected public finances."
Through their effect on public finances, price trends in turn influenced governments'
incentives to participate in the gold standard. Deflation forced a difficult choice between
deteriorating borrowing conditions and painful adjustments. Countries starting with
relatively low debt levels could compromise, letting their debt drift slightly and making
only partial fiscal adjustments. But for those that already had fairly high debt levels, such

pursued fu econometric research. I will comment on each.
The first thesis is that, contrary to the established doctrine that dates the gold
standard to the period 1880-1913 (the golden age of liberalism), the European gold
standard started only in the late 1890s. It was only then that all of Europe was on
board - among the late comers were Italy, Austria-Hungary, Spain and Portugal as
well as Russia. This thesis is both correct and uninteresting. It is factually correct
that various European countries hopped on and off gold for quite a while, staying on
for an extended period only starting in the late 1890s. This fact is, of course, well
known from the vast historical literature on the subject. For example, Bloomfield
(1963) notes: 'The span of the international gold standard, stretching from about
1880 to 1914, was a relatively brief one. In 1880 the following were the main
countries on the gold standard or some variant thereof: Great Britain, France,
Germany, the United States, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden,
Denmark, Finland, Canada, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. They were
joined in 1890 by Romania, at the turn of the century by Russia, Japan, India,
Argentina, Italy, and Austria Hungary.' The thesis of Flandreau, Le Cacheux and
Zumer is peculiar in two respects. It obviously adds nothing to the facts as we know
them. Anyone who thought that Russia was on gold in 1881 just because that was
the gold standard period simply had not done their homework. But in a deeper sense
their thesis is misleading. First, it would have occurred to no one at the time to think
of a European gold standard. This was the period of internationalism per se and
Australia, Canada and even Japan were part of the relevant world. Second, and
more importantly, the fact that Austria-Hungary (by then a side show to the German empire) or even more so Spain were not yet in gold was absolutely
irrelevant to what Europe was doing. It was just as irrelevant as their presence or
absence from EMU next year is to people's perception that Europe has a common
money.
The periphery just does not matter; the issue is what the big players do. The big
players were on gold and that is why economic history, rightly, puts the dates
1880-1913 on the gold standard. What the big players were doing set the trend
and showed the standard to aspire to; the periphery, whether Latin America or
central Europe and the Club Med, gradually made their way to it. The fact that
Italy slipped in 1992 from the convergence process in the ERM does not mean
that a grand European convergence was not under way. The fact that even now the UK cannot make up its mind surely does not mean that there will not be a
European Monetary Union. The same goes for talking of the gold standard in the
1880s and beyond. There is another chapter to the story: how did the stragglers

The second hypothesis offered by the authors is that the gold standard could not
work until the late 1890s, when under the pressure of gold discoveries, real interest
rates turned negative and debt burdens of peripheral high-debt countries started
declining. This is an interesting hypothesis indeed, but it is not plausible, at least not
in the way in which it is offered - that expected real interest rates declined,
seigniorage increased and thus public finance improved. The fact that debt might
have played an important role is suggested by the debt per capita data in Figure 6.
Some of the laggards were, indeed, high-debt countries. But so were some countries
that went on gold early and successfully. More specifically, centring on expected real
interest rates as the trigger for going on gold is unconvincing. It is unclear why the
periphery should have anticipated the shift towards inflation while the creditors did
not: if they had been on a par, interest rates would have increased along with
inflation expectations and nothing would have been gained. It is also unclear how inflation, on a gold standard, increases seigniorage. There might be such a
possibility, but it is more the case for paper currencies on floating rates than for gold standards.
It is certainly correct that a period of low real interest rates and steady growth,
such as the 1890s, puts battered debtors in a better financial position. Accordingly, it
allows them to shape up debt service and restore normality in public finance,
including going on gold as a show of confidence for their creditors. In fact, they
might get a loan to get on gold. In this sense, the 1890s surely helped. But was the crucial factor the actual debt reduction, the countries on gold held up as an

Introduction
This is a very thorough and well-reasoned paper, and it makes several important
points with which I fully concur: for example, the endogeneity of central bank
independence and the crucial role of gold discoveries in sustaining the gold standard
during its last years. But I wonder just how much we can learn from the gold
standard in looking forward to the issue of fiscal stability in EMU. For one thing,
the authors shrink the heyday of the international gold standard to about a decade
before the First World War - scarcely as long as the period from the signing of the
Maastricht Treaty to the introduction of notes and coin. If we take this seriously, it

Identification
The authors agonize over the problem of why, if markets discipline borrowers, we
nevertheless observe excessive debt accumulation. Presumably part of the answer
would be revealed if it were possible to identify and estimate the demand curve. In
other words, how sensitive were the borrowers to interest costs at different times? As
things stand, we have at most a supply curve, which, even if it predicts an effective
ceiling to the supply of debt, is still only half the story. It is not clear what exogenous
variables other than war dummies one might include that could separately identify
the demand curve. But, by the same token, it is not irrefutably clear that the authors
have identified a pure supply curve.
General discussion
The correlation between wars and the ability to remain on the gold standar

Portugal, Spain and Greece. Rudi Dornbusch pointed out that, in fact, there ha
been many countries with debt ratios as high as Portugal and Greece that did no
abandon the gold standard. In any case, the correlation with war could not be
perfect as, for some countries, the deterioration of the debt/GDP ratio had actual preceded the wars. Patrick Honohan countered that this was only because
preparation for war may be as costly as the war itself. Maurice Obstfeld stressed
that the connection between wars and interest rates was not automatic, and may

A2. National product and prices
Recently, substantial efforts have been devoted to extending our knowledge of European
accounts well beyond pioneering works on core countries. We were able to obtain reliable
data for virtually every country in the sample. The references are as follows: AustriaHungary: Komlos (1987) and Schulze (1997); France: Levy-Leboyer and Bourguignon (1985); Germany: Hoffmann et al. (1965); Greece: Kostelenos (1995); Spain: Prados de la
Escosura (1995); Portugal: Nunes et al. (1989) and Lains and Reis (1991); England: Mitchell (1990); Russia: Gregory (1994); Netherlands: Smits et al. (1997); Sweden:Johansson (1967); Denmark and Norway: Mitchell (1993). For Belgium and Switzerland, a series was reconstructed on the basis of end-of-period estimates as well as of indications for real GDP
growth given in Maddison (1991). Swiss prices are found in Ritzmann (1996).
A3. Exchange rates
The exchange rates used were constructed on the basis of Schneider et al. (1991), except for
Greece, for which we used a Lyonnais series. Data are annual averages.
A4. Exports
We relied exclusively on Mitchell (1993), except for the Netherlands, for which the figures
are flawed. Dutch exports are from Smits et al. (1997).
A5. Population
Data in Mitchell (1993) completed by Gregory (1994) for Russia and by the Credit Lyonnais
returns for the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
A6. Long-term interest rates
The classic source for long-term interest rates on government (gold) bonds is Homer and
Sylla (1991). However, the returns that these authors report cover only part of our sample.

Various techniques were used to test the three specifications presented in panels (a),

hand, the 'punishing' and 'rationing' specifications cannot be directly tested against

B3. Instruments
To decide whether it is necessary to use instrumental variables, we first perform Hausman-Wu specification test (Hausman, 1978) reported in Table 6 for each regressio
The test generally rejects the equality of the two sets of estimated coefficients (instrument
variables versus non-linear least squares), indicating the need to use instrument variable
techniques (Davidson and MacKinnon (1993) indicate how this test is applicable to non
linear models). Second, we test for the adequacy of our instruments by regressing th
appropriate independent variables on our instruments set. In all three cases, an F-test reject
the hypothesis that the instruments are jointly insignificant (results not reported). Third,
test the validity of our choice of instruments using a Sargan test (Sargan, 1958; Matyas a
Sevestre (1996) consider the use of the Sargan test in the context of panel data econometrics
and Davidson and MacKinnon (1993) show the analogue of the test for non-linear models
The success of the test (see Table 6) implies that all of the explanatory power of the
instruments is being captured in the independent variables. Finally, we have tried alternativ
subsets of instruments with the rationing equation, again in order to assess paramete
stability. Table B3 shows that the parameter estimates and the implied rationing threshol are stable.
