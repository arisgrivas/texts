Ottoman State Finance: A Study of Fiscal Deficits and Internal Debt in 1859–63
Keiko Kiyotaki
This study examines a problem of fiscal deficits based on the
Ottoman budget of 1275 A.H. (March 1859–February 1860).1 In this
period, state debt amassed rapidly due to increased market loans abroad.
In order to evaluate the credibility of the Ottoman government for a new
loan, Lord Hobart and Mr. Foster, members of the British Board of Trade,
examined the 1275 budget and the balance of foreign and internal debts
in 1861.2 They found that a monetary policy of issuing new paper money
was an immediate problem, rather than fiscal policies causing the fiscal
deficits and internal debt. Their conclusion was supportive of the new
foreign loan, which the Ottomans could obtain in 1862 for the withdrawal
of the paper money from circulation. Ottoman records, however, show
that Hobart and Foster were not able to measure the effective size of the
fiscal deficits. The deficits were larger than their estimates, to the extent
of implying a high risk of the insolvency that actually took place in 1875.
Their underestimation illustrates an ambiguity of fiscal deficits and debt
a problem for Ottoman public finance in the Tanzimat (Reformation)
period in 1839–76. In consideration of the impact of Hobart and Foster’s
report on Ottoman state finance, it is necessary to elucidate the causes of
the fiscal deficits that they failed to predict. This work aims to shed light
on the fiscal problems of deficits and debt by focusing on Hobart and

Foster’s study in comparison with Ottoman records and to estimate their
approximate extent around the given year of 1275/1859–60.
An overview of foreign loans may help to understand the
significance of Hobart and Foster’s report in the history of Ottoman state
finance. The Ottoman government acquired a foreign market loan of £5
million for the first time during the Crimean War (1853–6) in 1854, which
was issued at 80% of the face value with an interest rate of 6%.3 It
borrowed another loan of £3 million in London in 1855 with a premium of
2.625% and the interest rate of 4%, i.e. a better effective rate than the
previous loan. They made a further borrowing of £5 million in 1858,4 and
yet another of 2 million francs in Paris in 1860.5 The rapid increases of the
foreign loans acquired by the Ottomans without repayment had raised
increasing concerns of European creditors regarding Ottoman financial
conditions. Hobart and Foster’s survey was the first attempt of the
Europeans to analyse the risk of the Ottoman Empire in international
finance. Based on their report, the Ottoman government could borrow a
new loan of £8 million in 1862 at the issue rate of 68% and the interest
rate of 6%; the largest ever, although the conditions were still adverse to
the borrower because of the high real interest rate.6 The 1862 loan, used
for the withdrawal of paper money from the domestic market, further
increased the balance of foreign debt. The government then placed itself
into a spiral of market borrowing, mostly in francs, until it finally fell into

The loan of £2 millions was delivered in 1859 at lower issue price of 62.5%, i.e. with the higher effective interest rate, estimated at the maximum rate of 9.6%. 5 2,037,220 francs. 6 The real interest payment of the 1862 loan was estimated at 8.82% of the face value at the most, which was better than the previous loan delivered in 1859.

insolvency. The Ottoman debts were eventually controlled by the Public
Debts Administration in 1881.
The loan of 1862 was a turning point in the history of the Ottoman
foreign loans. Borrowing subsequently became heavy and costly. The
new trend set by the 1862 loan was accounted for by many factors such
as the increased money supply, the burden of repayment of existing
loans, and the subsequent deterioration of the Ottoman financial position.
Among them was the study of Hobart and Foster itself. Their report,
received by Earl Russell, the Secretary of Foreign Affairs on 20
December 1861, strongly indicated the higher credibility of the Ottoman
Empire based on expectation of future economic development. It certainly
had an impact on the contract of the 1862 loan as the authoritative report
on Ottoman financial conditions. Blaisdell suggested in his book that the
report ‘set for a favourable reception to the proposal of the Imperial
Government for another loan’.7 In reality, state revenues had not
increased enough to finance large interest payments and amortisation.
Debt positions of the Ottoman Empire deteriorated rapidly thereafter.
Problems of Ottoman foreign loans have been an issue of
international politics in most academic works in this area.8 In their
framework, the Ottoman’s reneging on repayment obligations was not an
economic consequence but evidence of imperialism in which the Great
Powers aimed to expand political control over economic resources in the
Empire. If it were true, the fiscal deficits and debt would have been of little

matter for Hobart and Foster in their survey. Their report, indeed, shows
that politics was not a pivotal factor of initiating the survey. It clearly
reflects that the British government had a keen concern on Ottoman
financial conditions, to say nothing of the size of fiscal deficits in the
budget and internal debt. In consideration of their chief concerns about
Ottoman economic performance, it is necessary to examine the start of
surging foreign market loans of the Ottomans from an economic point of
view.
I will first examine the report of Hobart and Foster, and then the
causes of the fiscal deficits and internal debt. Since the report is inclusive
of the estimated deficits in 1276–7/1860–2, I provide the budgets of
1276–8/1860–3 as well. I consulted the budgets recorded in European
sources so as to be consistent with the statement of the 1275 budget in
the report. The 1276 budget was recorded in the report of Falconnet—the
manager of the Ottoman Bank, while the 1277–8 budgets were provided
to the British government by the Ottoman grand vizier in hand-written
form.9 With regard to the study of budgets, pre-nineteenth century
budgets were well surveyed by Yavuz Cezar, Halil Sahillioğlu, and Ahmet
Tabakoğlu.10 Sahillioğlu in particular pointed out a direct cause of the
fiscal deficits by analysing the two-calendar system of public finance
solar year for revenue collecting and lunar year for spending, but he
claimed that it was no longer in operation in the Tanzimat period. Tevfik
Güran exploited new fiscal records on the budgets in the period between

1257/1841–2 and 1277/1861–2.11 His statistics include the 1275–6
budgets, but not those of the 1277–8 years. They help in revealing
changes in the fiscal position in this period, but are not detailed enough to
provide a critical view on the report of Hobart and Foster without the
budgets of these years. Since budget deficits are the crux of the matter, I
will look into Sahillioğlu’s study and Güran’s statistics in examining
Ottoman fiscal structure and the causes of fiscal deficits and internal debt.
In addition to the state budgets, I will examine local data which are
available at Başbakanlık Osmanlı Arşivi (Prime Ministry’s Ottoman
Archive) in Turkey. This record shows the significance of the provinces for
state revenues since most direct taxes belonged to the local accounts. It
also suggests a need for an examination of the local causes of the fiscal
deficits and debt. In order to evaluate Hobart and Foster’s report from the
aspect of local public finance, I will use the province of Baghdad as an
example. The province had the characteristics of the fiscal structure that
Sahillioğlu pointed out. Its financial data are sufficient to give crude
estimates of internal debt in the province as evidence of the shortcomings
of the report. Concerning exchange rates, the official rate of Ottoman
currency to the pound sterling was 110 kuruş (piastre).12 Hobart and
Foster used in their report the depreciated rate of 125 kuruş to £1. In this
text, I use their rates, because the market rate of the kuruş had
depreciated before the survey.

Financial Conditions—the Survey of Hobart and Foster
State revenues in the 1275 budget are summarised in Table 1.
They are classified into three categories according to the sources of the
revenues; direct taxes, indirect taxes, and profits of the state’s economic
activities. The direct taxes were levied on agricultural produce, personal
income, and non-Muslim subjects for exemption from military service. The
largest amount, 29.3% of the total, was collected as dîme, or tithe on
grain and commercial produce. The tax rate was one-tenth or one-fifth of
the grain produce, depending on the source of agricultural water. The tax
was higher for commercial crops. The tax of verghi in the report (verği in
Ottoman Turkish) was an income tax imposed on an individual,
theoretically in proportion to his actual income. The amount of the tax was
determined annually according to the estimated financial capacity of the
taxpayer, or the productivity of land held, assessed by the authorities of
the village or town to which the taxpayer belonged. The income from fixed
assets, such as rent of a house, mill, or shop was also taxed by the
verghi. It yielded the second largest revenue for the government after the
tithe, at 23% of the total. Another main source of direct taxes was sheep
tax (agnâm) charged per capita, yielding the fourth largest share of the
revenues. The rachat militaire (bedel-i askeriyye) was charged on non
Muslims for exemption from military service. It used to yield a larger
portion of revenues second only to the tithe, but lost its significance after
equal conscription among Ottoman nationals was introduced.
The revenues from indirect taxes were no less important than the
revenues from direct taxes. Custom duties occupied 14.3% of the total as
the third largest revenue source. Most of these custom duties were
collected by the tax farmer except for those in Istanbul and certain ports,
as described in the report, in the Sea of Marmara, the Dardanelles, and
on the Asiatic coasts of the Black Sea. Excise duties on tobacco, spirits,
and stamp duty had not been significant but were becoming increasingly
6


important as reliable sources of revenues. Besides these, the government
profited from various economic activities and state enterprises such as
the production of salt, and sales from mines, forests, and fisheries. Their
revenues amounted to 7.9% of the total. Rent of public houses, shops,
and other commercial facilities entered into the revenues as well. Tapou
(tapu) in the list of revenue sources was the title on state land registered
with the land registry. Sale of the tapu title began to take place, benefiting
the government. Their revenues were not remarkable, only 0.6%, but
soon increased as a result of development of the land market.
Table 2 presents a breakdown of state expenditure according to the
function of governmental departments and agencies. The Ministry of War
was the largest consumer of revenues, with 30.7% of total expenditure.
Adding in the Navy, defence expenditure comprised nearly 40% of the
total. The Ministry of the Interior at 13.7% and the civil list or the sultan’s
private account at 11.3% followed these. Another important item, which
had not yet become burdensome, was interest payments and the
amortisation of foreign and internal debts. This accounted for 14.2% of
total expenditure in 1275/1859–60, or 16.2% of total revenue. Spending
on public works, infrastructure, and education was extremely low,
although their budgets increased in later years.
Table 3 presents the stock variables, debt and liabilities, that
Hobart and Foster estimated for the survey year. The total debt in
1276/1860–1 was estimated at £36.5 million, and these figures are
inclusive of the estimated deficits in flow variables; the exchange loss at
4.6% of the total in 1276–7/1860–2 and the budget deficits at 8.6% in
1274–7/1858–62. The share of foreign debt was 40%, the largest item in
the total debt. The debt of the Ministry of Finance and the sundry liabilities
of the various other departments, such as the War Departments, civil
services, and the civil list amounted to £8.16 million, nearly as much as
the annual revenue of £9.7 million in 1275/1860–1. Internal debt in stock
7


and bonds was 24.4% of the total, the debt of the Ministry of Finance
12.2%, and the sundry liabilities 10.2%. Internal debt was largely incurred
from an issue of ‘consolidé’ and payment obligations of each ministry
called ‘serghis’ (‘sergi’), which shared 9.2% and 8.4% of the total debts
respectively.13
In addition to the analysis of the state budget, Hobart and Foster
gave rough estimates of money supply. The government issued new
paper money (kaime) at the rate of £10 million (1,250 million kuruş) a
year before the survey. £5.2 million (650 million kuruş) was used for the
repayment of short-term borrowing. The remaining £4.8 million (600
million kuruş) was allocated to the Exchange Bank (i.e. the Ottoman
Bank), to replace the old paper money, and for the fund of public work.14
The new paper money, however, depreciated rapidly against the pound
sterling and even against the old paper money in the domestic money
market.
The issue of the new paper money caused problems in the local
money market. In the provinces, hard currencies, usually silver coins
(beslik in the report) were actually used, while the paper money was not
permitted to circulate. In spite of this restriction, paper money had been
used for payments of salaries to officials and for commercial transactions.
The official rate of the paper money was kept at the same value with
current coins. But its value depreciated dramatically. The silver coins
were debased at a rate of 8 to 10%, and the paper money was devalued
13 TNA: PRO FO 424/24, Report, 22-8. According to the report, each minister had the power of issuing ‘serghis’ in order to pay for spending over the budgetary expenditure of his ministry that was allotted by the council of Tanzimat. It made the limitation of the expenditure ineffective. 14 Paper money was called variously kâğıt para, kavâim nakdiye, and kaime.

at larger discounts, 50% lower than the coins. Paper money was used for
payments of taxes by the tax farmers, as a medium of transaction and
commercial transfer between the capital and the regions. It was often
made without discount, thereby causing a large exchange loss to the
government in the capital.15
The report was also concerned with a failure of monetary policy.
The government had issued large quantities of interest-bearing paper
money (also called kaime), incurring high interest payments due from the
government. The report explains, ‘For instance, the “consolidés” bearing
6 per cent. interest are now quoted at about 75, purchasable in paper,
which is itself at a discount of nearly 140 per cent., so that 100 piastres
“consolidé” can be purchased for about 31 piastres gold, showing a rate
of interest of about 19 per cent’.16 At the time of the survey, the market
value of the 100-kuruş ‘consolidé’ bearing 6% interest dropped by 25%,
reaching the price of 75 kuruş. The real interest rate could not be more
than 8%, for the value of the paper money to be unchanged. But the price
of the paper money itself dropped by 69% against the official price.17
Thus, the real interest rate of the 100-kuruş ‘consolidé’ became much
higher at 19.4% annually. The new issue of ‘consolidé’ came to a halt
because of this heavy devaluation of paper money and the high effective
interest rates.
In spite of a high debt ratio to the revenue, the report considered
that ‘the debt of Turkey is comparatively speaking so small, and the
resources of the country so great, that when once the public confidence is
gained there will no longer be any difficulty in obtaining a loan on fair
15 TNA: PRO FO 424/24, Report, 39. The problems of paper money are recorded in numerous Ottoman archival sources.

terms, or in consolidating the outstanding liabilities into Government
stock’.18 Looking into the data of revenues and expenditures, Hobart and
Foster did not project any serious financial problems that forecast the
possible default of Ottoman finance in the future. Indeed, the budgets of
1276–8/1860–3 after the 1275 budget do not show substantial decreases
in revenues (Table 1), although the expenditures increased somewhat in
1277–8/1861–3 (Table 2). The estimates of the primary balance, that is
the balance of expenditures and revenues after deduction of the
payments of interests and sinking funds, were surplus, at 2.1% of the total
revenue in 1275/1859–60 and higher in the other years (Table 4).
The report was rather concerned about problems resulting from the
increased money supply that the Ottoman government had created since
the War. It recommended the immediate withdrawal of paper money from
the domestic market, which indeed occasioned the new 1862 loan. The
foreign debt would not be so large as to interfere with economic growth,
as Hobart and Foster concluded:
It only remains for us to express our confident hope that the Porte would without further delay, by a prompt, systematic, and comprehensive measure of reform, avail itself of the ample means at its disposal for the re-establishment of its credit and the permanent improvement of its financial condition. The case with which it has to deal is not the hopeless one of a taximposing power stretched to its utmost limit, and yet inadequate to meet the demands of a large and inevitable expenditure; but simply of financial disorder, caused chiefly by inattention to the ordinary rules of political economy and fiscal administration. With a taxation, if it were duly adjusted, extremely light; a system of government which, even if made thoroughly efficient in all its branches, would be comparatively inexpensive; and a national debt (including under the term

10


every kind of liability) which is less than 42,000,000l. sterling, we cannot believe that the Empire will be permitted any longer to remain in a condition bordering upon insolvency. We have no sufficient reason to suppose that the promise of the new reign will be unfulfilled, or that the Turkish government, rather than adopt a few simple, obvious, and with ordinary firmness and prudence, easily feasible reforms, will quietly allow the prevalent prediction as of national disaster, and decadence to be accomplished.19
Hobart and Foster thought that internal debt was not so serious as
to endanger the credibility of the government in the international money
market. They predicted large increases in tax revenues once on-going
reforms were implemented. They also expected great improvements in
agricultural production, marketing, and transport. Indeed, the government
pursued the fiscal reforms which Hobart and Foster recommended in the
report, even in such a remote province as Baghdad. Ottoman financial
data at the time of their survey, on the other hand, show that state finance
had already deteriorated. One piece of evidence is the fiscal deficits that
did not appear explicitly on the statement of the state budget. Such
deficits accumulated as liabilities in the long run, with impacts that Hobart
and Foster underestimated in their report.
A Cause of Fiscal Deficits and Internal Debt
One of the causes of the fiscal deficits was examined by Sahillioğlu
in his study on the skip (sıvış) year. The skip year occurred as a result of
the traditional use of two calendars for public finance. In the two-calendar
system, the government had to skip one fiscal year every thirty-three
fiscal years because of a lack of resources of revenue to finance
19 Ibid. 41–2.
11


expenditure.20 The year to be disregarded was called a skip year. The
skip years in the Tanzimat period were 1255 A.H. (March 1839–February
1840 on the hicrî (lunar) calendar) and 1288 A.H. (March 1871–February
1872 on the hicrî calendar; March 1872–February 1873 on the malî
(solar) calendar). The year 1255 was skipped, while 1288 was not.
Although its impact has not yet been studied with regard to the year of
1288/1872–3, the principle of the skip year might have affected the
system of tax prepayment and spending arrears. Sahillioğlu scrutinised
Ottoman financial records in the skip years in the period between 1640
and 1740, to study why financial crises and uprisings of the military
occurred in the skip years, and what counter-measures the government
undertook. His study not only shows the political and economic
significance of the skip year, but also provides a clue to the cause of
implicit fiscal deficits and debt in the Tanzimat period.
The problem of the two-calendar system was caused by the
government’s use of two fiscal years, a solar year (365 days) for revenue
collecting and a lunar year (354 days) for spending. As an example, with
regard to tax farming for revenue collecting the tax farmer paid the tax in
March and August, because the assessment of harvests was
straightforward by the solar calendar. Expenditures, on the other hand,
did not correspond with the intervals of the revenue collection. They were
made according to the lunar calendar, as illustrated by quarterly
payments of payrolls. The solar calendar was eleven days longer than the
lunar calendar. Accordingly, the period of thirty-four fiscal years in the
lunar calendar used for the account of expenditures was equal to the
period of thirty-three fiscal years in the solar calendar used for the
account of revenues. Assuming that the revenue in the solar fiscal year
20 Sahillioğlu, ‘Sıvış Year Crises’, 230–52; Tabakoğlu, Osmanlı Maliyesi, 241–6.
12


was used for spending in the lunar fiscal year, there occurred one lunar
year in every thirty-four when the government had no revenue to finance
spending. This year was called the skip year, periodically causing various
political and economic problems to the government.
Sahillioğlu considered that the two-calendar system functioned as a
built-in measure of public finance in favour of the government. He defined
the revenue deficiencies in the skip year as fiscal deficits, and examined
measures of deficit finance.21 The government simply made up for the
shortfall of revenues by aids (iâne; forced donation), confiscation of
private property on default of inheritance and as a penalty, or by use of
other fiscal policies to redress the deficiencies. The fiscal measures in
those days were a pre-arrangement of a saving fund for spending in the
skip year, the imposition of extraordinary taxes, expansion of the tax base
on new land through conquest, or simply to default on payments. In
addition to these fiscal policies, short-term borrowing and monetary
policies were other possible measures. Particularly in the provinces,
where fiscal policies had been less effective without centralised fiscal
administration, the government often resorted to monetary policies of
debasing currencies and their use for payments of payrolls. From 1710
on, the government split the revenues into two in preparation of spending
in the skip year. At the same time, the government resorted to
widespread use of a new form of tax farming, in which the contract was
longer and based on larger initial payments. After the financial crisis of
the 1770s, tax farming for the farmer’s lifetime became predominant, but
this was rescinded in the 1830s. The government resumed the original
21 Political turmoil occurred in the skip years of 1448, 1481, 1513, 1546, 1578, 1612, 1644, 1677, and 1710. Sahillioğlu, ‘Sıvış Year Crises’, 237–47.

practice of tax farming in which tax-collecting right was auctioned off for
the term of one to five years.22
Sahillioğlu’s study allows a rough measurement of the scale of
implicit deficits as a consequence of the two-calendar system. It is
assumed that the government collected the extra revenues for thirty-three
years, equivalent to the expenditures of one lunar year. In the skip year,
consequently, the revenues collected in advance became 0% of the
expenditure. From this point, another period of advanced collection of
revenues would begin and continue until the next skip year. The mean
prepaid amount of revenues was estimated to be the average of 0% and
100%, i.e., 50% of the total annual revenues. Although this is a crude
calculation, the estimated percentage closely corresponds with the
number that I could obtain from the statistics of Güran’s23 study.
Table 5 shows the amounts of revenue collected in advance for ten
years around the survey period of Hobart and Foster. Columns are the
breakdown of the annual revenues paid in advance equivalent to pounds
sterling. For example, as for the year of 1275/1859–60, £5,817,386, or
62.6% of the total revenue was collected in the current fiscal year. The
remaining £3,470,370, or 37.4% of the total was collected in the years
prior to the 1275 fiscal year. £2,345,449 in 1274/1858–9 belonged to the
revenues of 1275/1859–60 but it was actually collected a year before.
Prepaid revenues were 49.7% of the total in 1276/1860–1 and 32% in
1277/1861–2.
With regard to the prepayment for the future fiscal years, the data
up to 1277 show that £5,312,073 was collected in 1275/1859–60 as the
prepayment of revenues in the 1276–7 years. Adding the cash flows of

14


the prepayment from the 1278 year on, the total sum would be larger than
this figure. Together with the current revenues of £5,817,386, the
government would receive more than £11,129,459 in 1275/1859–60, a
much larger amount than the revenues in the budget of £9,291,008. The
data in the other fiscal years may provide the same result. They suggest
that the government collected the prepayments of taxes due in future
fiscal years, whose sum with the receipts of the current revenues were
always larger than the revenues in the budget.
Güran’s statistics imply fiscal deficits and internal debt as a result of
tax prepayments. The prepayments might be the government’s borrowing
from taxpayers. The principal amount of the prepayment in the past years
was cleared off in the current fiscal year in which the tax was due.
However, it was necessary for the government to grant a deduction on
the prepaid tax as a sort of interest paid to the taxpayers. There were
various kinds of tax privileges such as tax deduction and even tax
exemptions for certain years as an incentive for prepayment. The
decrease of tax revenues as a result of tax reduction was a deficit in the
flow variables of the current year. On the other hand, the government
received the prepayments of taxes belonging to future fiscal years, whose
sum was added to the stock variable in the current year. This appears to
be a built-in system of fiscal deficits and debt, which was logically the
same as the system of public finance based on the two-calendar years.
Fiscal Problems in the Province of Baghdad
Another cause of fiscal deficits and debt arose from the
decentralised fiscal structure and administration in the regions. The
revenues in 1278/1862–3, for example, show a remarkable distinction
between the capital (Der-saâdet; Istanbul) and provincial governments.
72% of the total revenue was collected in the provinces, and 28%
15


belonged to the account of the central government in Istanbul. The
breakdown of the revenues furthermore exemplifies a wide difference in
their resources. The provincial governments collected all direct taxes, the
profits of sales of state properties and forest products, and fees of land
registration. They shared with the central government the revenues from
the tax for exemption from military service, custom duties, contracts,
stamp duty, and the other miscellaneous taxes. The revenues from the
postal service, mines, police, quarantines, trade and commerce all
belonged to the centre. In consideration of the largest shares of tithe and
verghi (30.7% and 22.5% in the total revenues), the budget of the
provincial government was more significant to Ottoman state finance than
Hobart and Foster envisaged24 (Table 7).
To give an illustrative case of the fiscal deficits and debt in local
public finance, I examine the fiscal system in the province of Baghdad.
The province of Baghdad, one of thirty-one provinces on the list, was the
sixth largest of all the provinces in terms of the sum of the current
revenues in 1278/1862–3. Its revenues fell to ninth in 1284/1868–9, but
recovered to the fourth largest in 1286/1870–1 and 1287/1871–2. Table 6
presents the breakdown of the current revenues in the province in 1278
87/1862-72. In the 1278 fiscal year, in the first column in the table, the
tithe revenue was the largest, £312,312 (68.1% of the total revenue),
followed by miscellaneous fees (12.8%), verghi (10.7%), and sheep tax
(4.8%) respectively. The tax for exemption from military service was not
large, due to the low population of non-Muslim subjects in the province.
The revenues were consumed locally according to the local
scheme of spending, but they were not sufficient to pay for everything.
Fiscal records - precise statistics on spending are not available – show

that deficits had existed explicitly and implicitly in the local budget. One
reason for this was the government’s heavy use of tax farming for
revenue collection on most tax resources. The practice of tax farming
enabled the government to receive prepayment in return for giving up a
portion of the tax as a discount for early payment. The government could
theoretically avoid fiscal deficits, if it could keep its expenditures within the
cash flow in the fiscal year. In reality, however, both investment and
current expenditures had increased rapidly since the Crimean War, at a
faster pace than revenue. The accumulation of fiscal deficits had never
ceased in this province.
This change corresponded with the progress of modernisation
projects and the expansion of the public sector in the province. The
province of Baghdad was full of documentary evidence. Reşit Pasha
(1852–6) purchased two steamboats from France at the price of 82,936
francs for the use of commercial navigation on the Tigris River from
Baghdad to Basra.25 Soon after, the government had to rebuild the port of
Basra (Fao) to accommodate the new boats, whose projects had actually
begun earlier during Necip Pasha (1842–7).26 Renovations of port
facilities, the customhouse, and the quarantine areas were necessary, as
well. Concurrently, the project of constructing telegraph lines set out to
connect Baghdad and Basra.27 The expenditures of public work had been
charged to the account of the province, except for the construction of
telegraph lines to Baghdad, which the central government reimbursed.28
On top of the investment expenditures for the on-going projects,
there was another local need for budgetary expansion in the province.

This was the administrative reorganisation of the province which occurred
in Baghdad at the time of Hobart and Foster’s survey between
1275/1859–60 and 1278/1862–3. The government re-established the
provincial and district administration in Baghdad, in which the Baghdad
governor was empowered to appoint the local officials in the province and
districts. They were paid from the local treasury in Baghdad according to
their rank and post. Even official appointees of the central government
were listed on the rolls of the provincial government. The reforms
equipped the government for better civil and fiscal administration but
needed a larger expenditure programme than before.29 The increase in
current expenditures was another important cause of the fiscal deficits of
the local budget.
The funds for new projects and reforms were various and local. The
government had found it rather easy to finance increased capital
expenditures in the expectation of high returns from the investment. For
purchasing the steamboats, for example, Reşit Pasha arranged payment
by instalments from the profits of grain exports to Jeddah and Yemen for
consumption by Egyptian troops. Increased portions of custom duties also
served as a source of off-budget expenditures on the transportation
projects. To complete the telegraph lines, the government used loans
from the British India Office with lower interest payments under an
arrangement by the central government.30 Local finance of current
expenditures was more complicated and diversified than project finance.
As analysed in the previous section, the government received tax
prepayments from tax farmers. It borrowed short-term from local

financiers, the governor and other high officials, foreign residents, tax
farmers, and even from the treasuries of other provinces. The
government also took new tax revenues from tribesmen who had not
been obedient, at the risk of tribal disturbance against the government.31
Tax increases and short-term borrowing were not sufficient to cover the
current expenditures. The government trimmed the payrolls and the other
off-budget payments as much as possible. However, large portions of
military and administration expenses fell into arrears and implicitly turned
into internal debt.
Implicit Debt in the Province of Baghdad
The arrears of payments indicate the existence of internal debt
accrued implicitly in the province. Table 8 shows the payment arrears
recorded on Zimmet Defteri (Book of Liabilities) in the fiscal year of
1278/1862–3. Entries are broadly demarcated as military expenses,
administrative expenses, purchase of grains for exports, and direct
receipt of revenues by the local treasury. The expenditure of £806,739
was 176% over the current revenues of £458,819 in 1278. Payment
arrears most often involved the recipients of military expenses and
payrolls in administration. For example, the arrears were £474,127 for
military expenses and £312,842 for administrative expenses, which
together comprised 97.5% of the arrears. Most payments were made
within a few years but in some cases were much-delayed because of
shortages in repayment funds.
30 Meclis-i Vâlâ 16755.
19


Simple aggregates of the arrears suggest that Hobart and Foster’s
figures for the domestic liabilities of the entire government in Table 3 were
not accurate. The arrears of payments on administrative expenses in
Baghdad (£312,842) were far larger than the liabilities estimated by
Hobart and Foster (£51,808) in the table. The arrears of the military
expenses (£474,127) alone accounted for 88% of the £535,760 of the
War Department. It is unknown why Hobart and Foster gave a figure so
much lower than the numbers in the Ottoman local records. It is possible
that the Baghdad government made the amounts of liabilities appear
higher by including interest payments in the obligation. Even if the figures
allowed a discount, they would still have been large, probably above
Hobart and Foster’s estimates.
In order to assess the financial burdens of the arrears on the
Baghdad treasury, I looked into the weighted values of outstanding
payments in Table 8. They were calculated by multiplying the amount of
arrears by the number of years for which the payments were deferred. My
crude estimates clearly show that the longer the arrears, the heavier the
burden of payments on the local government. For example, £284,094 in
military expenses due on the fiscal year of 1278/1862–3 was actually paid
with a three-year delay in the fiscal year of 1281/1865–6. The
accumulated amount of the arrears was £852,282, reached by multiplying
the arrears by three. It indicates that the government put it on the account
of debt each year until repayment, while adding up the arrears that
occurred in the other fiscal years. It serves as a useful indicator of implicit
debt that the government owed. Let me consider as an example the ratio
of accumulated arrears to expenditures on the purchase of grain and the
31 Reşit Pasha claimed the tax arrears on Arab tribesmen at the amount of £52,794 in Hindiya, £18,145 in Diwaniya, £14,362 in Hilla, and £25,098 in Samawa. BA. İ, Dahiliye 27211, 28 Muharrem 1275.

treasury, where data are available for the 1278 fiscal year. The total
expenditures were £27,645 and £4,948, respectively. The arrears were
put on the outstanding account yearly, aggregating to £26,020 and
£7,652, respectively. Dividing the total accumulated arrears by the total
expenditures, the ratios become 94.1% and 155% respectively. The
percentage would be considerably higher on military and administrative
expenses, since their payment arrears were far larger and longer than the
other two entries. The numbers show the approximate ratio of the debt
from the payment arrears to the expenditure. The government would have
incurred larger payment obligations than the original amount, if the
government had been obliged to offer compensation for the arrears.
Payment arrears, including the arrears of other fiscal years, placed heavy
financial pressure on the provincial government in Baghdad.
In sum, an obvious cause of internal debt in the province of
Baghdad was that current expenditures grew faster than revenue.
Temporary decreases in tax revenues also occurred in this province for
reasons of drought, epidemics, flooding of rivers, attacks of locusts, and
tribal disturbance. In these cases, the primary balance of the local budget
might have deteriorated, not yielding a surplus as estimated, but running
in deficit. Fiscal deficits easily accumulated as debt to the government. In
addition to this, the government was indebted to tax farmers by receiving
the tax prepayments of future years, and to recipients of expenditures as
a result of payment arrears. The government was burdened with heavy
internal debt, which was a main characteristic of local fiscal structure in
the province.
Conclusion
This paper has examined the report of Hobart and Foster and
focused on their analysis of the 1275 budget and the domestic liabilities
21


as of the survey year. They pointed out that a failure of monetary policy
was a serious detriment to the Ottoman economy. Another foreign loan
was necessary to withdraw the paper money from the domestic market
and stabilise the economy. Their survey, however, had the drawbacks of
incomplete statistics and lack of knowledge of the public finance of the
Ottoman government. They understated the size of the fiscal deficits and
internal debt, which turned out to be the key factors in subsequent
financial troubles.
The work of Sahillioğlu based on the contemporary governmental
records suggested the fiscal structure of deficits that Hobart and Foster
overlooked. He proved that the use of solar and lunar years for public
finance was a built-in system of tax prepayments which created fiscal
deficits in the pre-Tanzimat period. Güran’s data showed that this
proposition still applied even after the Tanzimat. Tax prepayments caused
a huge drop in cash revenues in the current tax year, at the amount of
nearly half of the revenue. In order to make up for this shortage, the
government received the prepayments of the taxes which would be due in
the following years. It was the government’s borrowing, or the internal
debt, from the taxpayers, which would be paid off on the account in the
future tax year. Hobart and Foster took into consideration problems of
fiscal administration in their report but were unable to account for the
fiscal structure running in deficit and creating internal debt explicitly and
implicitly as a result of tax prepayments.
Another problem of the report was observed from my analysis of
the archival records of local public finance. A record of the state revenues
showed that the budget of the provincial governments was much larger
than that of the central government. Hobart and Foster were unaware of
the importance of the provincial government in state finance, and so they
undervalued the fiscal deficits and internal debt accrued locally. I looked
into the fiscal position in the province of Baghdad, as an example. The
22


size of the local budget in this province expanded drastically along with
the progress of modernising projects and the centralisation of provincial
administration after the Crimean War. Both the investment expenditures
for project finance and the current expenditures increased more rapidly
than current revenues. The Baghdad government used various measures
of deficit finance, such as local borrowing, tax prepayments, and simply
making the payments in arrears. Above all, the arrears were the most
functional measure of coping with the increases in current expenditures.
Looking into the local records of liabilities, the government recorded large
amounts of payments in arrears as debt. However, the longer the period
of arrears, the heavier the financial burden on the provincial government.
Hobart and Foster registered estimates of the arrears as domestic
liabilities, but their figures were much lower than the estimates of the
arrears in Baghdad.
Hobart and Foster did not give full consideration to the built-in
structure of fiscal deficits and debt, and the rapid increases in the size of
deficit-financed local budgets in the provinces. This may be a reason for
the Ottoman financial troubles of the 1860s, which eventually resulted in
default on foreign debt in 1875 and the Public Debts Administration of
1881.
